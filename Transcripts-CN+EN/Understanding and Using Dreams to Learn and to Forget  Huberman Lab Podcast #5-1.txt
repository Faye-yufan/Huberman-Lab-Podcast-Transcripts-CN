欢迎来到HubermanLab播客
Welcome to the HubermanLab Podcast,
在这里我们讨论科学与日常生活中的科学工具
we discuss science and science space tools for everyday life.
我是Andrew Huberman
I'm Andrew Huberman
是斯坦福医学院的神经生物学和眼科教授
and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
本播客与我在斯坦福大学的教学和研究角色是分开的
This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
然而
It is,
这是
however,
我的部分愿望  目的是为了给消费者提供零成本的关于科学的信息
part of my desire to bring you zero cost a consumer information about science and science,
以及相关工具
related tools.
为了与这个主题保持一致
In keeping with that theme,
我要感谢今天播客的赞助商
I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
我们的第一个赞助商是HelixSleep
Our first sponsor is Helix.
HelixSleep制作的床垫非常适合你的睡眠需求
Sleep makes mattresses that are ideally suited to your sleep needs.
他们家的
helix.
床垫是惊人的
Mattresses are amazing,
我之所以这么说 是因为我一直睡这个床垫
and I can say this because I've been sleeping on one 
而且睡得比以前任何时候都好
and I've been sleeping better than I've ever slept before.
关于Helix床垫的有趣之处在于
The interesting thing about healing smashes is that they're tailored to
 它们是根据你独特的体型和睡眠方式量身定制的
your unique body type and sleeping style once a sleeping style.
恩
Well,
如果你去他们网站
if you go to the hill,
你可以做一个快速测验
excite you can take a quick quiz.
大约需要两分钟  看你是趴着睡
It takes about two minutes as to whether or not you sleep on your stomach,
还是侧着睡
your side,
还是背靠着睡
you're back,
不管你是否来回翻转
whether or not you flip back and forth,
或者你不知道你是以什么姿势睡觉
or whether or not you don't know in what position you sleep 
以及你是睡着的时候倾向于热还是冷
as well as whether or not you tend to run hot or run cold,
或者冷的醒来
wake up cold,
热的醒来
wake up hot,
等
etc.
如果你这样做
If you do that,
然后它就会把你和适合你睡觉的床垫匹配起来
then it will match you to the mattress that's perfect for your sleep needs.
如果你想试试Helix床垫
If you want to try a helix mattress,
你可以登陆helixsleep.com/huberman
you can go to helix sleep dot com slash huberman,
如果你去那个网站
and if you do that,
除了免费枕头外 您还可以减去200美元
You'll get two hundred dollars off your order as well as to free pillows.
这是helixsleep.com/huberman
that's helixsleep dot com,slash huberman.
今天播客的第二个赞助商是Athleticgreens
The second sponsor of today's podcast is athletic greens.
Athleticgreens是一款综合补剂
Athletic greens is an all in one,
维生素矿物质益生菌饮料
a vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
我从2012年开始使用Athleticgreens
I've been using athletic green since two thousand and twelve,
我开始服用它 因为我对应该服用哪些维生素
and I start using it because I had a lot of confusion about what vitamins 
和哪些矿物质有很多困惑
and minerals I should take and taking an athletic greens.
而Athleticgreens让我在一款产品里 就能得到我需要的所有东西
Allow me to get the foundation of sort of the base of everything I need in one easy to consume.
一款产品
Formula.
而且它味道很好
It tastes great,
我把水和一点柠檬汁混合
I mixed with water and a little bit of lemon juice,
很喜欢喝它
and I like drinking it.
里面的益生菌对我也很重要
And the probiotics in there are important to me as well,
因为有很多数据现实
because there are a lot of data out.
现在已经确定了肠道微生物群以及肠道大脑通路
There now identified the gut microbiome and the importance of the gut brain 
在四种免疫功能中的重要性
access in the four immune function,
代谢功能等等
metabolic function and so forth.
如果你想尝试Athleticgreens
If you want to try athletic greens,
你可以去athleticgreens.com/huberman
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
如果你这么做了
and if you do that,
他们还会给你送来一年的液体维生素D3
they'll also send you a year's supply of liquid vitamin D.
维生素 K
Three K too.
有很多数据开始显示  维生素d3对免疫功能的重要性
There are a lot of data starting to surface about the importance of vitamin D three for immune function,
代谢功能和内分泌功能等
metabolic function and endocrine function and so forth.
此外
In addition,
如果你去athleticgreens.com/huberman
if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
你会得到一年的维生素d3和K补剂
you'll get the year supply of d three and K too,
还有五个免费旅行装
as well as five free travel packs,
就是小包装的Athleticgreens产品
which are little packets of athletic greens.
除了你的如常服用 当你在飞机上或其他旅行时
In addition to your normal order and those are great for when you're on the plane 
这些就很好用
or your otherwise traveling,
不用什么搅拌工具就能摇匀
they mix up really easily without any master.
不用勺子舀出粉末之类的东西  平时在家很容易做的事情
The need to spoon out powder and things of that sort those are the things that are easy to do at home,
在路上可能有点困难
kind of harder on the road.
这些包装在旅途中就很方便
Those packets make it easy while on the road.
今天我们来谈谈梦
Today we're going to talk about dreaming,
做梦时学习 做梦时遗忘
learning during dreaming and unlearned during dreaming,
特别是遗忘令人不安的情绪事件
in particular unlearning of troubling emotional events.
我对梦的兴趣可以追溯到很久以前
Now my interest in dreaming goes way back.
当我还是个孩子时
When I was a child,
我有个朋友 有一天他来找我
I had a friend and he came over one day,
他带来了一个面具 在里面角上有一个小红光
and he brought with him a mask that had a little red light in the corner.
他是通过某本杂志的广告买的这个东西
He had purchased the thing through some magazine ad that he had seen,
这个面具本来是用来触发清醒梦的
and this mask was supposed to trigger lucid dreaming.
清醒梦是指  在睡眠中做梦
Lucid dreaming is the experience of dreaming during sleep.
但能意识到自己在做梦的体验 在某些情况下能够指导自己的做梦活动
But being aware that one is dreaming and in some cases being able to direct one's dream activity.
所以如果你在清醒梦中想飞
So if you are in a lucid dream and you want to fly, for instance,
有报道说  有些人能够自己在梦里开始飞
some people report being able to initiate that experience of flying or 
或者把自己扭曲成动物 或者把自己送到他们想去的任何地方
to contort themselves into an animal or to transport themselves to wherever they want.
在梦中
Within the dream.
我试过这个装置  它的工作原理就是你在清醒状态下戴上面具
I tried this device the way it worked as you put on the mask during the waking state wide awake,
看着角上闪烁的微光
and you look at the low light flashing in the corner,
你晚上睡觉的时候也戴着它
and then you'd also wear it when you went to sleep at night,
然后
and indeed,
当我睡着的时候
while I was asleep,
我就能看到红灯
I could see the red light,
大概是通过我的眼皮
presumably through my eyelids,
也许我可能睁开了眼睛
although probably I know am I had opened my eyes?
我也不知道 因为我睡着了 因为我在做梦
I don't know I was asleep and then because I was dreaming 
我经历了一些非常生动的事情
and I was experiencing something very vivid,
我能意识到我是在做梦 然后开始引导梦中发生的一些事情
I was able to recognize that I was dreaming and then start to direct some of the events within that dream.
大约20%的人会做清醒梦
Now lucid dreaming occurs in about twenty percent of people,
在这些人中有一小部分人
and in a small percentage of those people,
他们几乎每天晚上都做清醒梦
they lucid dream almost every night.
以至于有报道说  他们中的许多人的睡眠不如其他情况下那么有活力
So much so that many of them report their sleep not being as restorative as it would be otherwise.
所有这些都是为了说明
Now all of this is to say that lucid,
清醒梦和普通梦都是深刻的经历
dreaming and dreaming are profound experiences.
我们倾向于极度依恋我们梦境的经历
We tend to feel extremely attached to our dream experience.
这也许可以解释  如果人们做了强烈梦
This may explain the phenomenon of people who have a very intense dream.
他们会把这个梦告诉所有人的这种现象
They need to somehow tell everybody about that dream.
或者告诉别人他们做过的梦
Or tell someone about their dream?
我也不知道这种行为是怎么回事
I don't really know what that behavior is about,
但有时我们醒来 我们会对梦的状态下发生的事情感到如此依恋
but sometimes we wake up and we feel so attached to what happened in this state,
我们认为  如果做完梦有一种与他人分享的强烈需求
that we call dreaming that there seems to be an intense need to share it with other people,
大概是为了处理和理解它
presumably to process it and make sense of it.
好
Now,
历史上很多人都试图理解梦
numerous people throughout history have tried to make sense of dreams 
并以某种有组织的方式表达出来
and in some sort of organized way,
其中最著名的
the most famous of which,
当然
of course,
是西格蒙德·弗洛伊德
is a Sigmund Freud,
他谈到了梦中的象征
who talked about symbolic representations in dreams.
很多都被证伪了
A lot of that has been kind of debunked,
虽然我认为人们对梦的象征多多少少都有一些兴趣
although I think that there's some interest in what the symbols of dreaming are,
这是我们今天要深入讨论的问题
and this is something that we'll talk about in more depth today,
虽然不是真正的
although not for it,
从理论上讨论
in theory in particular,
所以我认为  为了真正地思考梦以及如何处理它们
so I think in order to really think about dreams and what to do with them 
以及如何最大化地利用梦的体验 来学习和遗忘
and how to maximize the dream experience for sake of learning and unlearning.
解决这个问题的最好方法就是从睡眠的生理学角度
The best way to address this is to look at the physiology of sleep 
来研究我们对睡眠到底了解多少
to really just what do we know concretely about sleep?
首先
So first of all,
当我们昏昏欲睡的时候
as we get sleepy.
我们会让闭上眼睛
We tend to shut her eyes,
这是因为大脑中有一些自主中枢
and that's because there are some autonomic centers in the brain,
一些控制眼睑闭合的神经元
some neurons that control closing of the eyelids.
当我们感到困倦 然后进入睡眠
when we get sleepy and then we transition into sleep and sleep,
不管我们睡多长时间 我们通常都被分解成一系列90分钟的周期
regardless of how long we sleep is generally broken up into a series of ninety minutes cycles.
这些昼夜节律循环出现
These old treaty in cycles.
所以在晚上的早些时候
So early in the night,
这90分钟的周期通常包括浅睡眠和慢波睡眠
these ninety minute cycles tend to be comprised more of shallow sleep and slow wave sleep,
一个阶段
so stage one stage,
接着一个
two,
等等
etc.
我们称之为慢波睡眠
And what we call slow wave sleep.
我一会儿会详细解释这一切的意义
I'll go into detail about what all this means in a moment,
我们往往很少有所谓的REM睡眠
and we tend to have less so called REM sleep R E M sleep,
即快速眼动睡眠
which stands for rapid eye movement sleep,
我会详细讲一下快速眼动睡眠
and I'll talk about rapid eye movement sleep in detail so early in the night,
所以晚上的早些时候
a lot more slow,
每90分钟的周期  更多的是慢波睡眠和更少的快速眼动睡眠
wave sleep and less REM for every ninety minutes cycle that we have.
在一夜的睡眠中
During a night of sleep.
我们倾向于开始有越来越多的快速眼动睡眠
we tend to start having more and more REM sleep.
在之后的90分钟的睡眠周期中 更多的快速眼动睡眠  和更少的慢波睡眠
Some more of that ninety minutes cycle is comprised of REM sleep and less of slow wave sleep.
这是真的
Now this is true.
不管你半夜有没有醒来去洗手间
regardless of whether or not you wake up the middle of the night to use the restroom 
还是你的睡眠被打断了
or your sleep is broken.
你晚上睡得越多
The more sleep you're getting across the night,
快速眼动睡眠时间越多
the more REM sleep you're going to have,
还有快速眼动睡眠和非快速眼动睡眠
and REM sleep and non REM as I'll refer to.
它在学习和遗忘有明显不同的作用
it have distinctly different roles in learning and unlearning,
它们明显负责学习和遗忘不同类型的信息
and they are responsible for learning and unlearning of distinctly different types of information.
这对学习运动技能
And this has enormous implications for learning of motor skills,
忘却创伤性事件有很大的影响
for unlearning of traumatic events,
或者在处理情感上的挑战和情感上的愉快片段  都有影响
or for processing emotionally challenging as well as emotionally pleasing events.
我们会看到
And as we'll see,
人们可以利用白天的活动来进入更多的慢波睡眠
one can actually leverage their daytime activities in order to access more slow wave sleep 
或者我们称之为非快速眼动睡眠或者更多快速眼动睡眠
or non REM sleep as we'll call it or more REM sleep 
这取决于你特定的情感和生理需求
depending on your particular emotional and physical needs,
所以这确实是生命中一个重要的阶段
so it's really a remarkable stage of life that 
我们对自己有比你想象得更多的控制和力量  所以我们也会谈论清醒梦
we have a lot more control and power over then you might believe we'll also talk about lucid dreaming.
我们还会讨论幻觉以及药物引起的幻觉
We're also going to talk about hallucinations and how drug induced hallucinations 
导致很多梦境有惊人的相似之处
have a surprising similarity to a lot of dream states.
还有一些非常重要的区别
and yet some really important differences.
好
OK,
让我们从慢波睡眠或非快速眼动睡眠开始
so let's start by talking about slow wave sleep or non REM sleep.
我意识到慢波睡眠和非快速眼动睡眠并不是一回事
And I realized that slow wave sleep and non REM sleep aren't exactly the same thing,
对于你们
so for you,
睡眠爱好者们
sleep aficionados out there,
我现在就混着说了
I am lumping right now,
正如我们在科学中
as we say in science,
有混淆者 也有分明者 我两者都是  有的时候我会混为一谈
there are lumpers and there are splitters and I am both sometimes a lump.
有时我会清晰地区分开来  为了轻松的交流而分开
Sometimes I split for sake of clarity and ease of conversation.
现在我要变成一个混淆者了
Right now I'm going to be a lumber.
所以当我说慢波睡眠时
So when I say slow wave sleep,
我指的就是非快速眼动睡眠
I mean Nono REM sleep generally.
虽然这两者是有区别的
although acknowledged there is a distinction.
慢波睡眠
slow wave sleep,
所以
so slow.
慢波睡眠是以一种特殊的大脑活动模式为特征的
Wave sleep is characterized by a particular pattern of brain activity
 在这种模式下 大脑的新陈代谢处于活跃状态
in which the brain is metabolically active,
但是这些大范围的活动包括大脑的大部分区域
but that there's these big sweeping waves of activity that include a lot of the brain.
如果你想查这个
If you want to look this up there,
你可以找到证据 证明神经活动的波 扫过联结皮层
you can find evidence for sweeping of of waves of neural activity across association cortex 
穿过脑干的大片区域 也就是所谓的被囊叶枕部通路
across big swaths of of the brain stem the socalled ponds tunicate occipital pathway.
先是脑干
This is brain stem,
丘脑 然后是皮层
thalamus and then cortex.
如果你们感兴趣 可以记住
For those of you that are interested.
尽管在快速眼动睡眠中会发生更多这种情况
Although more of that is going to occur in REM sleep,
关于慢波睡眠有趣的是  与之相关的神经调节物质
Now the interesting thing about slow wave sleep are the neuromodulators that tend to
 在慢波睡眠中有最活跃和最不活跃之分
be associated with it that are most active and least active during slow wave sleep.
这就是为什么 这边要提醒大家  神经调节剂这些化学物质  作用都相当缓慢
And here's why to remind you neuromodulators are these chemicals that act rather slowly?
但它们的主要作用是使特定的大脑回路活跃 而使其他的大脑回路不活跃
But their main role is to bias particular brain circuits to be active and other brain circuits to not be active.
就像音乐播放列表
These are like the music playlist,
想想神经调节剂
so think of Neuromodulators,
有乙酰胆碱  去甲肾上腺素  血清素和多巴胺
and these come in the names of acetylcholine norepinephrine serotonin and dopamine 
把它们想象成音频设备上的推荐播放列表
think of them as suggesting playlists on your audio device,
所以你可以想象
so you know,
古典音乐在感觉和音调上与其他音乐有明显的不同
classical music is distinctly different in feel and tone,
还有一些其他的特征也不同 比如和第三次浪潮朋克
and a number of other features from like third wave punk or from you know,
比如hiphop  想象它们绕开了特定类型的神经回路活动
hip hop right to think of them as bypassing toward particular genres of neural circuit activity.
好
OK,
柔和的音乐 vs 快节奏的音乐
mellow music versus really aggressive fast music,
或者  有歌词的节奏音乐
or rhythmic music that includes lyrics,
vs
verses,
无歌词的纯音乐
rhythmic music that doesn't include lyrics that's,
或多或少  可以这么考虑这些神经调节剂的方法
that's more or less the way to think about these neuromodulators.
因此 它们与某些大脑功能有关
and they are associated as a consequence with certain brain functions.
所以我们知道
So we know,
例如
for instance,
回顾一下清醒状态下的通话是一种神经调节器
And just to review acetylcholine in waking states is a neuromodulator that 
它会放大与注意力有关的大脑回路的活动
tends to amplify the activity of brain circuits associated with focus and attention.
去甲肾上腺素是一种会放大  大脑回路中与警觉性相关的神经调节剂
Norepinephrine is a neuromodulator that tends to amplify the brain.
会让人想要不停地动
Circuits associated with alertness.
而血清素  一种神经递质 它被释放出来
and the desire to move serotonin is the neuromodulator that's released intends to 
旨在放大大脑和身体中与幸福相关  以及保持静止的回路
amplify the circuits in the brain and body that are associated with bliss and the desire to remain still.
多巴胺  被释放的时候
and dopamine is the neuromodulator that's released and is associated with 
它与大脑和身体中与追求目标 快乐
amplification of the neural circuits in the brain and body associated with pursuing goals 
和奖励相关的神经回路放大有关
and pleasure and reward.
所以在慢波睡眠中
So in slow wave sleep,
会发生很有趣的事情
something really interesting happens.
从本质上说 就没有乙酰胆碱
There is essentially no acetylcholine  
乙酰胆碱的产生和释放  是从两个地方
acetylcholine production and release an action from the two major sites which are
这两个主要的部位是在脑干的一个核
in the brain stem from a nucleus.
这一对由生发核组成
The pair by Germinal nucleus.
如果你真的想了解前脑
If you really want to know or from the forebrain,
这些核就在一边 你们不需要知道这些名字
which is nucleus beside us and you don't need to know these names,
但如果愿意 可以记一下
but if you like,
所以我才把它们说明一下
that's why I put them out there.
乙酰胆碱产量骤降
acetylcholine production plummets.
它几乎是0
it's just almost to zero,
乙酰胆碱
and acetylcholine,
就像我刚才提到的
as I just mentioned,
与专注有关
is associated with focus.
可以把慢波睡眠看作是大脑中大规模的活动波
She can think of slow wave sleep as these big sweeping waves of activity through the brain 
是一种空间和时间的扭曲 所以我们不能真正的去关注任何一件事
and a kind of distortion of space and time so that we're not really focusing on any one thing now.
其他当时非常活跃的分子  或者去甲肾上腺素
The other molecules that are very active at that time or norepinephrine,
这有点让人惊讶 因为通常在清醒状态或清醒状态下
which is a little bit surprising because normally in waking states nor up
 你的去甲肾上腺素会与  警觉性  以及动的欲望联系在一起
an effort is going to be associated with a lot of alertness and the desire to move.
但在慢波睡眠中  并没有大量的去甲肾上腺素
But there's not a ton of norepinephrine around in slow wave sleep,
但它就在周围
but it is around,
所以在慢波睡眠中有一些与运动回路相关的东西
So there's something associated with the movement circuitry going on in slow wave sleep,
记住这主要发生在夜晚的早期
and remember this is happening mostly at the beginning of the night.
这时你的睡眠主要是慢波睡眠
Your sleep is dominated by slow wave sleep.
所以没有乙酰胆碱
So acetylcholine very little.
很少的去甲肾上腺素
norepinephrine
尽管体内有很多血清素
Although there is some and a lot of serotonin and serotonin again,
与另一种
is associated with this desire,
一种幸福的感觉相联系
the sensation of kind of bliss or well being.
但是没有太多的动的欲望
but not a lot of movement.
在睡眠中 你倾向于不动 但在慢波睡眠中
And during sleep you tend not to move now and slow wave sleep,
你可以移动  你并没有瘫痪  所以你可以翻身  还有人会梦游
you can move your not parallel so you can roll over if people are going to sleep walk.
通常情况下
Typically,
这是在慢波睡眠期间 一些虐待狂实验表明
it's going to be during slow wave sleep and what studies have shown through some kind of sadistic
 如果人们被剥夺了慢波睡眠
experiments where people are deprived specifically of slow wave sleep,
这可以通过在电极记录显示他们处于慢波睡眠时  叫醒他们来实现
and that can be done by waking them up as soon as the electrode recording show that they're in 
或者通过化学方法改变他们的睡眠 使他们远离慢波睡眠
slow wave sleep or by a chemically altering their sleep so that it biases them away from slow wave sleep.
研究表明 运动学习
What studies have shown is that motor learning.
通常发生在慢波睡眠中
is generally occurring in slow wave sleep.
比如说在你睡觉的前一天
so let's say the day before you go to sleep.
你在学习一些新的舞蹈动作 学习一些特定的运动技能
You are learning some new dance move where you were learning some specific motor skill,
不管是精准的运动技能 还是普通课程运动技能
either a fine motor skill or a course motor skill.
假设这是一种新的锻炼形式  或者一些新的协调运动
So let's say it's a new form of exercise or on some new coordinated movements.
甚至可能是协调手指
This could be coordinate,
指间的活动
moving at the level of the fingers,
或者可以是在整个身体水平上协调  进行大型肢体运动
or it could be coordinated movement to level the whole body and large limb movements.
也可能涉及到与其他人合作
It could involve other people,
也可能是个人活动
or it could be a solo activity.
这些运动技能的学习
Learning of those skills.
主要发生在晚上早些时候的慢波睡眠中
It is happening primarily during slow wave sleep in the early part of the night.
此外
In addition,
慢波睡眠已被证明对学习细节信息很重要
slow wave sleep has been shown to be important for the learning of detailed information.
这并不一定是认知信息
Now this isn't always cognitive information.
我们之后会讲到认知信息
We're going to talk about cognitive information,
但在学习细节信息这方面  已有的研究表明
but the studies that have been done along these lines involve having 
如果让人们学习关于特定单词拼写的非常具体的规则
people learn very detailed information about very specific rules in the way that certain words are spelled,
往往是具有挑战性的单词
they tend to be challenging words,
所以受试者做了测试
so if people are tested.
就他们在这类考试中的表现而言
And in terms of their performance on these types of exams,
如果他们被剥夺了慢波睡眠
and they're deprived of slow wave sleep,
他们的表现往往很差
they tend to perform very poorly,
所以我们可以认为慢波睡眠对运动学习很重要
so we can think of slow wave sleep is important for motor learning,
运动技能的学习  以及对特定事件的具体细节的学习
motor skill learning and for the learning of specific details about specific events.
慢波睡眠非常重要
And this turns out to be fundamentally important,
现在我们知道了
because now we know that.
慢波睡眠主要发生在夜晚的早些时候
Slow wave sleep is primarily in the early part of the night,
运动学习主要发生在夜间的早期
and motor learning is occurring primarily early in the night,
细节的学习也发生在夜晚的早期
and detailed learning is occurring early in the night.
所以
Now.
对于那些只睡了三四个小时就醒来的人来说
for those of you that are waking up after only three or four hours of sleep,
这可能对你们有用
this might be informative.
这能告诉你  如果你只有睡那么一点时间
This might tell you a little something about what you are able to learn and not able to learn  
那么你能学什么 不能学什么
if that were to be the only sleep that you get,
虽然希望这不是你唯一的睡眠
although hopefully that's not the only sleep that you get,
我们将深入探讨如何最大化地进行运动学习
but we're going to dive deep into how it is that one can maximize motor learning 
以提取有关协调运动的更详细信息
in order to extract a more detailed information about coordinated movements 
以及如何让大家学得更快或更慢
and how to make them faster or slower,
这对某些运动来说可能有点重要
so that might be important for certain sports.
对某些运动来说可能是非常重要的
They might be it almost certainly important for certain sports.
这对任何形式的协调运动都很重要
It's going to be important for any kind of coordinated movement,
就像
like,
比如
say,
学习弹钢琴
learning to play the piano,
或者
or,
例如
for instance,
如何与他人学习并一起做动作
how to learn synchronized movements with somebody else.
也许我之前提到过舞蹈的例子
So maybe I mentioned the example of dance earlier.
如果你像我一样
if you like me.
几年前
A few years ago,
我开始学探戈  因为我有一些阿根廷的亲戚 但我跳得实在糟糕
I set out to to learn tango because I've some Argentine relatives and I was abysmal.
我总有一天会讲这个话题的
I need to return to that at some point.
跳得简直糟透了
I was just abysmal and one of the worst things about being 
如果跳舞跳得不好 最糟糕的事情之一就是别人也要忍受这个糟糕
a abysmal learning dance is that there's somebody else has to suffer the consequences also,
我不知道  也许在讲神经可塑性的那个月
so I don't know maybe in the month on neuroplasticity,
我将作为自我实验  再次探索这个问题
I'll explore that again as a self experimentation,
但了解慢波睡眠的关键在于它涉及到运动学习和细节学习
but the key things to know our slow wave sleep that involved in motor learning and detailed learning.
这个时间段  没有乙酰胆碱
There's no acetylcholine around at that time.
没有这种振幅很大的波动横扫整个大脑
Has this big amplitude activity sweeping throughout the brain,
同时有着去甲肾上腺素和血清素的释放
and that there's the release of these neuromodulators norepinephrine and serotonin and again,
这都发生在晚上的早些时候
that's all happening early in the night.
所以运动员
So athletes,
关心运动表现的人
people that are concerned about performance.
如果你只睡了几个小时就醒了比如三四个小时
if you happen to wake up after just a couple hours of you know three or four hours of sleep 
因为你对第二天的比赛很兴奋
because you're excited about a competition the next day.
可能是这样
Presumably,
如果你已经为这个比赛训练了所需的技能
if you've already trained the skills that you need for the event,
你参加那个比赛应该没问题
you should be fine to engage in that particular activity.
最好是睡个好觉你知道的
Now it's always going to be better to get a full night's sleep and you know 
比如你好好地睡个饱觉是6个小时
what full night sleep if for you at six hours,
多睡总比少睡好
and it's always going to be better to get more more sleep than it is to get less.
但是
However,
有些人会有点担心
I think some people get a little bit,
虽然不是过分担心 如果他们在比赛前没有睡个好觉
but not overly concerned that if they didn't get their full night sleep before some sort of physical event 
他们的表现就会变差
that their performance is going to plummet.
如果你已经知道你需要做什么 它已经储存在你的神经回路
Presumably if you've already learned what you need to do and it's stored in your neural circuits 
你知道如何使这些协调运动在慢波睡眠中的建议
and you know how to make those coordinated movements with the literature on slow wave sleep
 就是你补充的运动学习
suggest is that you would be replenished that the motor learning 
和锻炼的恢复  会发生在夜间的早期
and the recovery from exercise is going to happen early in the night.
我们就停在这里  稍微讲一下
so we'll just pause there and and kind of show of that for a moment.
后面我们会回到这个问题上的
then we're going to come back to it.
但我现在想谈谈REM睡眠
but I want to talk about REM sleep,
快速眼动睡眠
rapid eye movement sleep REM,
正如我之前提到的
as I mentioned before,
这会发生在整个晚上
occurs throughout the night,
但你会有更多的机会
but you're going to have more of it.
在这九十分钟里
A larger percentage of these ninety minutes,
临睡前的快速眼动睡眠是睡眠周期的组成部分
sleep cycles is going to be comprised of REM sleep as you get towards morning.
快速眼动睡眠很神奇
REM sleep is fascinating.
它是在五十年代发现的
It was discovered in the Fifties.
芝加哥的一个睡眠实验室
When a sleep laboratory in Chicago,
研究人员观察到人们的眼睛在眼皮下移动
the researchers observed that people's eyes were moving under their eyelids.
当我们稍后谈到创伤的时候
Now something very important that we're going to address 
我们要讲的非常重要的一点是眼球运动并不只是左右移动
when we talk about trauma later is that the eye movements are not just side to side,
它们在各个方向上飘忽不定
they're very erratic in all different directions.
有一件事我想我从来没听过的人在公开场合谈论过
One thing that I don't think anyone I've never heard anyone really talk about publicly 
为什么是眼球运动  睡觉时明明眼睛是闭着的
is why eye movements during sleep eyes are closed 
有时人们的眼皮会有点睁着 眼球四处乱跳
and sometimes people's eyelids will be a little bit open in their eyes are darting around,
尤其是小孩子
especially in little kids.
我不建议你这么做
I don't suggest you do this.
我甚至不确定这是否道德
I'm not even sure it's ethical,
但是当你在一个孩子睡觉的时候拉下他的眼皮
but it has been done when you pull back the eyelids of a kid while they're sleeping 
他们的眼睛到处乱飞  之前有人对他们的过去做过这样的事情
in their eyes are kind of darting all over the place that people do this to their past,
派对上朋友的恶作剧之类的
our friends at parties and things like that.
再一次
So again,
我不建议你这么做
I don't suggest you do it,
但我告诉你是因为以前有人做过所以你不必再做一次
But I'm telling you it because it's been done before and therefore you don't have to do it again.
但是快速眼动睡眠是很神奇的 
But rapid eye movement sleep is fascinating
因为脑干之间有联系
because there are connections between the brain stem
称为脑桥的区域以及丘脑和大脑顶部的区域
an area called the pons and areas of the thalamus and the top of the brain
丘脑和脑干顶部的一个区域参与产生不同方向的运动
an areas of the thalamus and the top of the brain stem that are involved in generating movements in different direction,
有时也叫SIM卡----
sometimes called cicadas,
虽然有时在快速眼动睡眠中
although sometimes during rapid eye movement sleep,
它不仅仅是快速的
it's not just rapid,
而且左右摇摆不定
it's kind of a jittery side to side thing,
然后眼球就会转动
and then the eyeballs kind of roll.
眼球的滚动看起来真的有点令人毛骨悚然
It's really pretty creepy to look at if you see so what's happening
有意识的眼球运动所涉及的回路有点混乱
There is the circuitry that is involved in conscious eye movements is kind of going haywire,
但它并没有失控
but it's not haywire.
这是来自大脑的活动波
It's these waves of activity from the brain.
向上延伸到所谓的丘脑
Stem up to the socalled Thalamus,
这个区域将感觉信息过滤到大脑皮层
which is an area that filter sensory information up to the cortex,
大脑皮层
and the cortex,
当然了
of course,
与意识知觉有关
is involved in conscious perceptions.
所以在快速眼动中
So in rapid eye movement,
还发生了一些其他事情
sleep there are a couple of things are happening.
除了
Besides,
快速眼动之外
rapid eye movements.
主要的是它们
The main ones are that their income,
我应该说
I should say.
与快速眼动睡眠中的慢波睡眠相比
In contrast to slow wave sleep in REM sleep,
在这种分子中 血清素基本上是不存在的
serotonin is essentially absent in the case of this molecule,
这种会让人产生幸福和平静感觉的神经调节物质 是不存在的
this neuromodulator that tends to create the feeling of bliss and well being and just calm placidity is absent.
好了
Alright,
这是有趣的
so that's interesting.
除此之外
In addition to that.
去甲肾上腺素
norepinephrine
这个参与运动和警觉的分子
this molecule that's involved in movement and alertness,
这时候一点都没有
is absolutely absent.
在我们的生命中 肾上腺素在我们的系统中基本上处于零活动状态
It's probably one of the few times in our in our life that epinephrine is essentially at zero 
这可能是为数不多的一次
activity within our system,
这对快速眼动睡眠中发生的梦的类型
and that has a number of very important implications for the sorts of dreaming that occur during REM 
以及在其中发生的学习过程  有很多非常重要的暗示
sleep and the sorts of learning that can occur in REM sleep and on learning.
首先
First of all,
在快速眼动睡眠中
in REM sleep,
我们是处于瘫痪状态的
we are paralyzed,
我们正在经历所谓的张力缺失
we are we are experiencing what's called Antonia,
这就意味着身体完全瘫痪了
which just means that were completely laid out and paralyzed.
我们也倾向于把我们梦到的任何事情
We also tend to experience whatever it is that we're dreaming about as 
当作一种幻觉或幻觉活动
a kind of hallucination or a hallucinatory activity.
很久以前
Long ago,
我观察幻觉和梦境
I looked into hallucinations and dreaming.
我在高中的时候就对这个很着迷
I was just fascinated by this in high school,
关于这方面 有一些好书
and there are some great books on this.
如果你对探索幻觉和做梦之间的关系感兴趣
If you're interested in exploring the relationship between hallucinations and dreaming,
其中最有名的是一个人
the most famous of which are from a guy.
一个哈佛大学研究员
Researcher at Harvard,
艾伦·霍布森(AllanHobson) 写了一本名为 梦境药店 (DreamDrugstore)的书
Allan Hobson and wrote a book called Dream Drugstore
 讨论了引起幻觉的药物和快速眼动睡眠期做梦的相似之处
and talked all about the similarities between drugs that induce hallucinations and dreaming in REM.
如果你愿意 你可以去看一下
So you can explore that if you like.
所以在REM中我们的眼睛在移动
So in REM our eyes are moving,
但我们身体的其他部分都瘫痪了
but the rest of our body is paralyzed,
而且我们产生了幻觉
and we are hallucinating.
身体没有肾上腺素
There's no epinephrine around.
肾上腺素不只是产生运动和警觉的欲望
epinephrine doesn't just create a desire to move and alertness.
它也是恐惧和焦虑的化学特征
It is also the chemical signature of fear and anxiety.
它是从我们的肾上腺释放出来的
It's what's released from our adrenal glands.
当我们经历可怕的事情时 比如一辆汽车突然在我们前面发出刺耳的声音
When we experience something that's fearful were alerting is if a car suddenly screeches in front of us.
或者我们会收到一条烦人的短信
Or we get a troubling text message.
肾上腺素就会被部署到我们的系统中
Adrenaline is deployed into our system.
脑部肾上腺素就是腺部肾上腺素
Adrenaline is epinephrine.
它们是等价的分子
those are equivalent molecules,
肾上腺素不仅仅是从肾上腺中释放出来的
and epinephrine isn't just released from our adrenals.
它也会在我们的大脑中释放
It's also released within our brain.
所以我们的生活中有一个奇怪的阶段 它发生在早晨
so there's this weird stage of our life that happens more toward morning,
我们称之为快速眼动睡眠
that we call REM sleep,
我们产生幻觉  并在脑海中产生一些可怕的经历
where we're hallucinating and having these outrageous experiences in our mind.
但与恐惧 恐慌和焦虑相关的化学物质是没有的
But the chemical that's associated with fear and panic and anxiety is not available to us,
这是非常重要的  你可以想象为什么这很重要
and that turns out to be very important and you can imagine why that's important.
这很重要 因为它让我们能够经历事情 回顾确实发生过的事情
It's important because it allows allows us to experience things both replay of things that did occur,
以及对没有发生的事情进行精心的扭曲
as well as elaborate contortions of things that didn't occur.
它让我们在没有恐惧和焦虑的情况下回忆那些
And it allows us to experience those in the absence of fear and anxiety,
而且
and that,
事实证明
it turns out,
这对于调整我们的情绪关系 来接受我们清醒时发生的挑战之事
is very important for adjusting our emotional relationship to challenging things that happened to us 
非常重要
while we were awake.
那些具有挑战性的事情有时会表现为社交焦虑
Those challenging things can sometimes be in the form of social anxiety,
或者一直在很努力的工作 或者担心即将到来的事情
Or just having been working very hard or concern about an upcoming event,
有时人们反映他们会
or sometimes people report,
例如
for instance,
在梦里 他们发现自己考试迟到了 或者在公共场合赤身裸体
dreams where they find themselves late to an exam or naked in public 
或者在某些特别难堪的场景中
or in some sort of situation that would be very troubling to them,
这几乎肯定发生在快速眼动睡眠期间
and that almost certainly occurs during REM sleep.
所以我们有一段不可思议的睡眠期在这段时间里
So we have this incredible period of sleep in which our experience of emotionally 
我们的情感经历从化学物质角度被阻止了
laden events is dissociated chemically blocked from us.
我们无法拥有真实的情感
having the actual emotion.
不过
now,
可能马上
probably immediately.
你们就会想
some of you are thinking well.
那么  噩梦呢
What about nightmares?
我经常做噩梦 而且噩梦里充满了情感
I have nightmares and those carry a lot of emotion.
或者有时你会在恐慌中醒来
or sometimes you'll wake up in a panic.
让我们分别来考虑一下这两件事
Let's consider each of those two things separately,
因为它们对理解快速眼动睡眠很重要
because they are important in understanding REM sleep.
在慢波睡眠中很有可能会做噩梦
There's a good chance that nightmares are occurring during slow wave sleep.
有些药物我不建议人们服用
There are actually some drugs that I don't suggest people take.
事实上
In fact,
太多了 我不会提及那些使人感到非常恐惧
so much so I'm not going to mention them that give people vary.
的东西
Kind of scary,
以及在梦里有什么东西在追着他们
your eery dreams in this kind of feeling that things are pursuing them,
或者当你在梦里被追赶时  身体却无法动弹
or that they can't move when they are being chased.
这其实是我做过的一个常见的梦
That's actually a common dream that I've had it.
我想这或多或少是一场噩梦
I guess it's more or less a nightmare.
一个人被麻痹 被什么东西追赶却不能移动
The feeling that one is paralyzed and can't move and is being chased by.
很多人说
a lot of people have said,
哦
Oh,
那一定是快速眼动睡眠 因为你已经瘫痪了
that must be in REM sleep because you're paralyzed,
所以你梦见自己瘫痪 不能动弹
and so you're dreaming about being paralyzed and you can't move.
我认为这可能是错误的
I think that's probably false.
研究表明 由于去甲肾上腺素在快速眼动睡眠中缺失
The research says that because norepinephrine is absent during REM sleep,
你不太可能会有这些强烈的恐惧记忆
it's very unlikely that you can have these intense fearful memories,
所以这些可能发生在慢波睡眠中
so those are probably occurring in slow wave sleep.
虽然也有一些人在快速眼动睡眠时会做噩梦
Although there might be instances where people have nightmares in REM sleep.
有些人经历过另一件事是
The other thing is some people experience.
当然 我也有过这样的经历 一觉醒来 我就会感到非常紧张
Certainly I've had this experience of waking up and feeling very stressed about whatever it was 
我刚才碰巧在想什么或者梦到了什么
that I happen to be thinking about it or dreaming about in the moments before.
这是一个有趣的例子 梦到的状态入侵到清醒的状态
and that's an interesting case of an invasion of the dream state into the waking state 
你醒来的那一刻
and the moment you wake up.
肾上腺素就开始分泌了
Epinephrine is available.
关于这方面的研究还没有完全明确
So the research on this isn't fully crystallized,
但大部分都指向了醒来后感到非常恐慌这个方向
but most of it points in the direction of the experience of waking up and feeling very panicked.
也许我想突出我自己的经历
Maybe I want to highlight me',
但也许你也有这种感觉
but maybe that you,
我们在白天正在经历一些令人不安的事情
we're experiencing something that was troubling in the daytime.
你会在睡梦中重复这一经历
You're repeating that experience in your sleep.
这时没有肾上腺素
Epinephrine is not available,
因此 与恐惧和焦虑相关的大脑回路被关闭
and therefore the brain circuits associated with fear and anxiety are shut off,
然后你能够处理这些事件然后突然醒来
and so you're able to process those events and then suddenly you wake up.
肾上腺素的激增与这种经历相联系起来
And there's a surge of adrenaline of epinephrine that's now coupled to that experience.
所以噩梦很可能发生在慢波睡眠中
So nightmare is very likely in slow wave sleep,
这种醒来时的恐慌  很可能是从思想和观念的入侵中产生
and that kind of panic on waking from something very likely to be an invasion of the thoughts and ideas,
无论在快速眼动睡眠中如何扭曲侵入清醒状态
however distorted in REM sleep invading the waking state,
事实上
in fact,
这让我想起了我之前提到过的事情
That brings to mind something that I've mentioned once before,
但是我想再提一下这个张力缺失
but I want to mention again this a tonia.
我们在睡眠时经历的瘫痪会侵入清醒时的状态
This paralysis that we experienced during sleep can invade the waking state.
许多人都有过醒来后全身瘫痪的经历
Many people report the experience of waking up and being paralyzed.
他们如往常一般醒来
they're legitimately waking up.
这不是一场醒来就瘫痪的梦
It's not a dream waking up and being paralyzed,
这很可怕 我以前也遇到过
and it is terrifying I've had this happen before it is,
我可以告诉你  完全清醒很可怕
I can tell you terrifying to be wide awake,
据我所知
and as far as I could tell fully,
意识清醒但无法移动
conscious but unable to move,
然后通常你可以在几秒钟内让自己摆脱困境
and then generally you can jolt yourself out of it in a few seconds.
但现在非常可怕的是
but it is quite frightening now some people actually experience 
有些人醒来时完全瘫痪 还产生幻觉
waking up being fully paralyzed and hallucinating.
在学术界和科学界有一种理论
And there is a theory in the academic and scientific community,
至少人们所报道的是外星人绑架 具有一定数量的核心特征
at least that what people report as alien abductions have a certain number of core characteristics.
与这些经历非常相似的怪异现象
That map quite closely eerily similarly to these experiences.
很多关于外星人绑架的报道都涉及到人们无法移动
A lot of reports of alien abduction involves people being unable to move,
看到特定的面孔会  产生幻觉 感觉他们的身体漂浮着 或者他们被转移了
seeing particular faces hallucinating extensively feeling that their body is floating or they were transported.
这和在清醒状态下被张力缺失入侵的经历很相似
This is very similar to the experience of invasion of Atonia into the waking state,
醒来后仍然瘫痪
waking up and still being paralyzed,
幻觉 就是快速眼动睡眠中做梦的特征
as well as the hallucinations that are characteristic of dreaming in REM sleep.
我并不是说人们说被外星人绑架 这种说法不合理
Now I'm not saying that people's alien abductions were not legitimate alien abductions.
我不会说 我又不在那里
How could I wasn't there,
如果我在那里
and if I was there,
我也不会告诉你的 因为那样我就是外星人 我也不会想让你知道
I wouldn't tell you because that would make me an alien and I wouldn't want you to know.
但是
But.
很有可能人们正在经历这些事情  它们是一种从睡眠状态进入清醒状态的入侵
It is quite possible that people are experiencing these things and they are an invasion of the sleep state
它们可能持续几分钟或更久 因为在梦中
into the waking state and they can last several minutes or longer and because in dreams,
空间和时间被扭曲了
space and time are distorted.
我们的感知是  好像它们持续了好几个小时
Our perception of these events could be that they lasted many hours,
我们真的能感觉到它们持续了好几个小时 但实际上它们只过了一小会儿
and we can really feel as if they lasted many hours when in fact they took only moments 
我们很快就会回到空间和时间的扭曲
and we're going to return to distortion of space and time in a little bit,
所以
so.
简单回顾一下我们讲的内容
To just recap where we've gone so far,
晚上早期的慢波睡眠被证明对运动学习和细节学习很重要
slow wave sleep early in the night that's been shown to be important for motor learning and for detail.
快速眼动睡眠有一定的梦境成分
Learning REM sleep has a certain dream component,
REM没有肾上腺素
where in which there is no epinephrine.
因此
Therefore,
我们不能体验焦虑
we can't experience anxiety,
我们是瘫痪状态
we are paralyzed,
这些梦往往非常生动 有很多细节
those dreams tend to be really vivid and have a lot of detail to them.
但在快速眼动睡眠中
and yet in REM sleep,
非常清楚的是 在快速眼动睡眠期发生的学习
what's very clear is that the sorts of learning that happen in REM,
或者不是运动
sleep or not motor event,
它更多的是关于忘却情绪事件
it's more about unlearning of emotional events.
现在我们知道原因了
And now we know why.
因为那时的化学物质
Because the chemicals available for.
真正感受到这些情绪现在并不存在 这有非常重要的含义
Really feeling those emotions are not present now that has very important implications.
所以让我们从两个方面来解决这些影响
So let's address those implications from two sides.
首先
First of all,
我们应该问 如果我们没有获得足够的快速眼动睡眠会发生什么
we should ask what happens if we don't get enough REM sleep 
如果人们没有获得足够的快速眼动睡眠 这种情况经常发生
and a scenario that happens a lot where people don't get enough.
快速眼动睡眠是这样的
REM sleep is the following.
我只解释我很熟悉的一个  因为它经常发生在我身上
I'll just explain the one that I'm familiar with because it happens to me a lot.
虽然我有办法适应
although I figured out ways to adjust,
我大约在10点30分  11点睡觉
I go to sleep around ten thirty eleven o'clock.
我很容易睡着 然后就醒了
I fall asleep very easily and then I wake up.
在3或4点醒了
Around three or four,
我是
I am,
我知道要用NSDR方法
I now know to use an SDR anon,
非睡眠深度休息方法
non sleep deep rest protocol,
这样我就能再次入睡
and that allows me to fall back asleep,
尽管它被称为非睡眠深度休息
even though it's called non sleep deep rest,
但它真的能让我放松身体和大脑
it's really allows me to relax my body and brain,
我常常会再睡着 一直睡到7点左右
and I tend to fall back to sleep and sleep till about seven m,
在这段时间里 我有大量的快速眼动睡眠
during which time I get a lot of REM sleep,
我知道这个是因为我测过
and I know this because I've measured it.
我之所以知道这一点 是因为我的梦往往非常强烈
and I know this because my dreams tend to be very intense of the sort that 
我们知道这是典型的快速眼动睡眠
we know is typical of REM sleep.
在这种情况下
In this scenario.
我在晚上早早地进入了慢波睡眠 快到早上的时候进入了快速眼动睡眠
I've gotten my slow wave sleep early in the night and I've got my REM sleep toward morning.
然而
However,
有时候我睡不着觉
there are times when I don't go back to sleep,
也许是因为要赶飞机
maybe have a flight to catch that happens.
有时我脑子里有很多事
Sometimes I've got a lot on my mind,
我也不会再睡了
and I don't go back to sleep.
我可以告诉你
I can tell you,
你可能已经经历过  缺少快速眼动睡眠  然后你情绪暴躁
and you've probably experienced that the lack of REM sleep tends to make people emotionally irritable.
它会让我们把小事放大
It tends to make us feel as if the little things are the big things.
实验研究表明  如果人们被选择性地剥夺了快速眼动睡眠
So it's very clear from laboratory studies where people have been deprived selectively of REM sleep.
我们的情绪就会变得有点精神错乱
that our emotionality tends to get a little bit unhinged.
我们往往会在小事上放大错误
and we tend to catastrophes small things.
我们往往会觉得这个世界让人害怕
we tend to feel like the world is really daunting.
我们永远不会按照我们想要的方式前进
We're never going to move forward in the ways that we want.
无论发生了什么 我们都无法忘却其中的情感成分
We can't unlearn the emotional components of whatever it is that's been happening,
即使不是创伤性的
even if it's not traumatic.
在快速眼动睡眠中发生的另一件事是某些类型的空间信息的重演
The other thing that happens in REM sleep is a replay of certain types of spatial information,
关于我们在哪里 为什么会在这些地方  这能匹配上一些漂亮的数据和研究结果
about where we were and why we were in those places and this maps to some beautiful data and 
这些研究是由麻省理工学院的马特·威尔逊多年前发起的
studies that were initiated by a guy named Matt Wilson at MIT years ago,
在啮齿类动物和其他非人类灵长类动物以及人类身上做的研究
showing that in rodents and it turns out in other nonhuman primates and humans,
在快速眼动睡眠期间  空间信息的重复几乎
there's a replay of spatial information during REM sleep that almost precisely maps to 
与我们白天经历的活动完全一致
the activity that we experience during the day.
当我们从一个地方移动到另一个地方
As we move from one place to another,
接下来说一个常见的场景
so here's a common world scenario you go to a new place 
你去一个新的地方  你穿过那个城市或环境
you navigate through that city or that environment.
这个地方不一定要有城市那么大
This place doesn't have to be at the scale of a city,
它可以是一个新的建筑  要寻找某一个房间
it can be a new building to be finding particular rooms,
新的人际互动
new social interaction.
你会有这样的经历 如果它非常重要
you experience that and if it's important enough that becomes solidified 
这个经历就会在几天后固化 你就不会忘记它
a few days later and you won't forget it.
如果是不重要的
If it's unimportant,
你可能会忘记
you'll probably forget it.
在快速眼动睡眠期间
During REM sleep there,
这就是你在这座城市 或建筑中漫步时 
it is a literal replay of the exact firing of the neurons that occurred 
神经元放电的真实再现
while you are navigating in that same city or building earlier,
因此 快速眼动睡眠似乎参与了这些空间细节信息的生成
so REM sleep seems to be involved in the generation of this detailed spatial information.
在快速眼动睡眠中到底发生了什么
What is it that's actually happening in REM sleep,
所以一个是有情感的分离
so there's this uncoupling of emotion.
但最重要的是
But most of all,
在快速眼动睡眠中 我们与特定的规则或算法形成了一种关系
what's happening in REM sleep is that we're forming a relationship with particular rules,
我们开始发现
or algorithms were starting to figure out,
根据我们白天的所有经验
based on all the experience that we had during the day.
不管我们是在避开某些人或接近某些人  这些事情是否重要
Whether or not it's important that we avoid certain people or that we approach certain people,
不管我们什么时候进入大楼  是否重要
whether or not it's important that you know when we enter a building,
我们进入电梯 然后在洗手间左转
that we go into the elevator and turn left where the bathroom is,
例如
for instance,
这些事物和地点的一般主题  以及它们是如何组合在一起的
these general themes of things and locations and how they fit together,
有一个我们一天里一直在反复的词
and that has a word it's called meaning during our day.
我们正在经历各种各样的事情
We're experiencing all sorts of things,
意味着  我们每个人如何将一件事与下一件事的相关性组合在一起
meaning is how we each individually piece together the relevance of one thing to the next right.
所以如果我突然告诉你 这支笔正在下载所有的信息到我的大脑
So if I suddenly told you that you know this pen was downloading all the information to my brain 
这对传递这些信息很重要
that was important to deliver this information.
你可能会觉得我很奇怪 因为一般来说
You'd probably think I was a pretty strange character because typically,
我们不认为笔能把信息下载到大脑里
we don't think of pens as downloading information into brains.
但如果我告诉你我从我的电脑上获取信息
But if I told you that I was getting information from my computer,
这让我看到了一些关于你的事情
that was allowed me to see things to you.
你会说
You'd say,
好吧
well,
这是完全合理的
that's perfectly reasonable.
这是因为我们与计算机 信息和记忆
and that's because we have a clear and agreed upon association with computers 
有着清晰且一致的联系
and information and memory,
你可能会说  我们和笔没有这种联系   很好
and we don't have that same association with pens you might say well die,
但我们大脑中的某些东西需要巩固这些关系
but something in our brain needs to solidify those relationships 
并确保某些关系不存在
and make sure that there are certain relationships don't exist,
REM睡眠似乎对此很重要
and it appears that REM sleep is important for that,
因为当你剥夺了自己的REM
because when you deprive yourself where people of REM,
他们开始看到奇怪的联系
they start seeing odd associations,
他们倾向于把东西堆在一起
they tend to lump or batch things.
我的经验告诉我 我曾经有过被剥夺了睡眠的经历
I know this from my own experience that I've ever been sleep deprived,
不幸的是 这种情况经常发生
which unfortunately happens too often.
因为我实在处理不好截止日期
Because of I'm terrible with deadlines.
经常会搞一个通宵
stipple an all nighter,
Var这个词开始看起来像是拼错了 建议你拼一个非常简单的词
the word Var starts to look like it spelled incorrectly and advise a very simple word to spell.
然后事情开始有点扭曲了
But things start to look a little distorted.
我们知道 如果人们长时间被剥夺快速眼动睡眠
and we know that if people are deprived of REM sleep for very long periods of time,
他们会开始产生幻觉
they start hallucinating.
他们真的开始看到没有发生的物体的关系和运动
They literally start seeing relationships and movement of objects that isn't happening,
所以快速眼动睡眠是我们建立情感负荷的阶段
And so REM sleep is really where we establish the emotional load,
但我们也开始抛弃所有不相关的意义
but where we also start discarding of all the meanings that are irrelevant.
如果你感性思考
And if you think about emotionality,
很多过度情绪化  或者灾难上升的现象  都是指看到无处不在的问题
a lot of over emotionality or catastrophe rising is about seeing problems everywhere,
你可以想象为什么会发生这种情况  如果你开始把你的经历和网络联系起来
and you could imagine why that might occur if you start linking the web of your experience to extensively.
为了拥有健康的情感和认知功能
It's very important in order to have healthy emotional and cognitive functioning,
个体事物之间的区分间隔相当狭窄
that we have fairly narrow channels between individual things.
如果我们在新闻上看到非常不安的事情
If we see something on the news that's very troubling will,
那你就有理由感到非常不安
then it makes sense to be very troubled.
但如果我们被这一切困扰 然后我们开始说
But if were troubled by everything and we start just saying,
一切都在困扰着我 我感到非常烦躁
you know everything is bothering me and I'm feeling highly irritable.
一切都在扭曲和困扰着我
And everything is just distorting and troubling me,
但很有可能
chances are,
我们并没有
we are not.
积极地消除这些意义
Actively removing the meaning,
生活与经历之间的联系
the connectivity between life experiences,
这几乎总是与快速眼动睡眠不足有关
as well as we could and that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep.
所以快速眼动睡眠是很强大的 它有一种神奇的能力去消除那些不重要的意思
so REM sleep is powerful and has this amazing capacity to eliminate the meanings that don't matter.
并不是说它加重了真正重要的意义
It's not that it exacerbates the meanings that do matter,
但它排除了那些无关紧要的意义
but it eliminates the meanings that don't matter and that
 而这些意义与发育早期的情况惊人地相似
bears a striking resemblance to what happens early in development.
这播客不是关于早期人体发展的讨论
This isn't a discussion about early in development,
但在那个时期
but early in development.
这就是为什么婴儿能做出协调的动作 以及为什么对于看似微不足道的事情
the reason a baby can generate coordinated movements and the reason why 
或着说成年人觉得微不足道的事情  孩子会对这些非常情绪化的原因
children can get very emotional about what seems like trivial events or what adults know to be trivial.
比如所有的冰淇淋店都关门了
Events like all the ice cream shop is closed and they just cut,
然后那孩子就哭成了一个泪人
and then the kid just dissolves into a puddle of tears.
而他的父母则会说   好的
And the parents say OK.
好吧
Well,
它会重新开门的
it'll be open again.
另一次 孩子们
Another time the children,
其中一个原因就是他们不能在一个更大的环境中协调
one of the reasons that they can't generate coordinated movement or place 
与冰激凌店关店这一事实
that event of the ice cream shops.
相关的行动和空间
Being closed into a larger context,
是因为他们有太多的连接 而大脑和神经系统的成熟
is because they have too much connectivity and much of the maturation of the brain and nervous system.
把我们带到了情绪稳定
That brings us to the point of being emotionally stable.
情绪合理
Reasonable,
成为一个理性的人  实际上大脑是在消除事物之间的联系
rational human beings is about elimination of connections between things,
因此 快速眼动睡眠似乎是我们解开各种经历之间潜在的情感联系的地方
so REM sleep seems to be where we uncouple the potential for emotionality between various experiences.
这就引出了REM睡眠和一些临床实践的基本关系和相似之处
And that brings us to the absolutely fundamental relationship and similarity of REM sleep to 
这些临床实践旨在消除情绪
some of the clinical practices that have been designed to eliminate emotionality 
帮助人们克服创伤和其他困扰
and help people move through trauma and other troubling experiences,
不管这些令人不安的经历  是家人去世还是至亲至爱的离世
whether or not those troubling experiences are a death in the family or have a close loved one,
发生在你或别人身上的可怕的事
something terrible that happen to you or somebody else,
或者你知道整个童年或者你脑海里的某个事件
or you know an entire childhood or some event that in your mind,
身体的感觉就像糟糕的
and body is felt as an experienced as bad,
可怕的或让人担心的经历
terrible or concerning.
你们很多人可能听说过创伤治疗 比如EMDR——
Many of you perhaps have heard of trauma treatment such as E M D R,
眼动心身重建法 或者氯胺酮治疗创伤
our eye movement desensitization and reprocessing or ketamine treatment for trauma,
这是一种最近才被合法化并被广泛应用于临床的技术
something that recently became legal and is in fairly widespread clinical use.
有趣的是
Interestingly enough,
EMDR和氯胺酮
EMDR and ketamine,
在核心思想上 与快速眼动睡眠有非常相似的特征
at kind of a core level bear very similar features to REM sleep,
我们来谈谈EMDR
so let's talk about the EMDR first
EMDR
EMDR
“眼动心身重建法”  是由一位心理学家发明的
eye movement desensitization and reprocessing is something that was developed by a psychologist.
弗朗辛·夏皮罗
Francine Shapiro,
弗朗辛在帕洛阿尔托 据说当时她在走路
Francine was in Palo Alto and the story goes that she was walking.
并非巧合
Not coincidentally,
她在斯坦福后面的树林里走
in the trees and forest behind Stanford,
她在回忆一件令人不安的事情
and she was recalling a troubling event in her own mind,
是她自己的生活
so this would be from her own life,
她意识到  在她走路的时候
and she realised that as she was walking,
那次经历的情感负担 就没有那么强烈
the emotional load of that experience was not as intense,
没有那么严重
or severe.
她从行走中没有感觉的经历中推断
She extrapolated from that experience of walking and not feeling,
作为对于压力事件的解脱
as stressed about the stressful event to a practice that 
她将其投入实践 用这种方法来治疗她的病人
she put into work and with her clients with her patience.
现在这方法已经变得相当普遍了
And that now has become fairly widespread.
这实际上是为数不多的
It's actually one of the few behaviorally.
由美国心理协会批准的
The behavior treatments that are approved by the American Psychological Association 
治疗创伤的行为疗法之一
for the treatment of trauma.
她让她病人做的是  在讲述一些创伤或麻烦的事情时
What she had her clients and patients do was move their eyes from side to side 
左右移动他们的眼睛
while recounting some traumatic or troubling event.
这是
Now this was,
当然是在诊所里
of course in the clinic,
她把行走那部分去掉了
and I'm guessing that she removed the walking components 
只把眼动部分带到了诊所
and just took the eye movement component to the clinic.
因为虽然和你的治疗师一起进行心理治疗和散步是件好事
because while it would be nice to go on therapy sessions with your therapist and take walks it has,
但有很大的限制
there are certain boundaries to that,
比如隐私性
such as confidentiality.
你知道的
You know,
如果周围有很多人
if they're a lot of people around,
一个人可能不愿意讨论情感经历  或者是否有障碍之类的事情
a person might not feel as open to discussing things or whether barriers and things like that.
你知道的
you know,
如果外面下雨或下雨
if it's raining or hailing outside,
那也很麻烦
get stuff to do.
为什么是眼动运动呢
Why I movement well,
她从没说过为什么是眼动运动
she never really said why eye movements,
但我会告诉你为什么
but soon I'll tell you why.
选择后者的决定  是因为在诊所工作中  这些眼球运动才是正确的
The decision to select these latter realized eye movements for the work in the clinic was the right one.
这些眼球运动
So these eye movements,
看起来很傻
they look silly.
我会做的 因为这就是我在这里的原因
I'll do them because that's why I'm here.
做起来很傻
They looked silly,
基本上就是  坐在椅子上 眼睛左右转动
but they basically involves sitting in a chair and moving one's eyes from side to side,
不说话
not while talking.
对我来说我没法讲话
You know for me,
然后叙述自己的情感事件
you know and then recounting the events,
有时是边说话边动眼睛
so it's sometimes talking while moving the eyes,
但通常是将眼睛左右移动30-60秒
but usually was moving the eyes from side to side for thirty sixty seconds 
然后去讲述那些具有情感挑战性的事情
then describing this challenging procedure.
好
Now,
我作为一名视觉科学家 我也研究压力
as a vision scientist who also works on stress.
当我第一次听到这个的时候
When I first heard this,
我觉得这太疯狂了
I thought it was crazy.
坦白说就是这样
Frankly,
人们会问我EMDR的事
people would ask me about the EMDR,
我觉得这太疯狂了
and I just thought that's crazy.
我去查阅了
I went and looked up.
一些关于EMDR为何有效的理论  有很多理论
Some of the theories about why EMDR might work and there were a bunch of theories.
虽然它模仿了快速眼动睡眠时的眼球运动
Though it mimics the eye movements during REM sleep,
但其实这种理论后来被证实
that was one turns out,
不是真的
that's not true,
我之后会解释它为什么错   另外一种理论是
and I'll explain why the other one was.
哦
Oh,
它使大脑两边的活动同步
it synchronizes the activity on the two sides of the brain.
好吧
Well,
可能吧
sort of,
我的意思是
I mean,
当你观察双眼视野观察两侧时
when you look into both sides of the binocular visual field,
你其实激活了视觉皮层
you activate the visual cortex.
但是我认为这种 大脑左右半球之间的同步性的理论
But this whole idea of synchrony between the two sides of the brain is something that
 已经从现代神经科学开始
I think modern neuroscience is starting to.
慢慢地
Let you say gently or not,
慢慢地脱离研究正轨
so gently move away from this whole right brain left brain business.
事实证明
It turns out,
然而
however,
我刚才在做的那种眼部运动  是弗朗辛·夏皮罗从这次散步中得到的
that eye movements of the sort that I just did in the Francine Shapiro took from this walk experience 
并带给了她的客户  带到了临床学
and brought to her clients and in the clinic.
是你在空间中移动时产生的眼球运动
Are the sorts of eye movements that you generate whenever you're moving through space 
当你自己产生这种运动时
when you are self generating that movement,
所以当你开车的时候
so not so much when you're driving a car,
当然 如果你骑自行车或者走路或者跑步
but certainly if you are riding a bicycle or you were walking or you are running,
你可能意识不到
you don't realize it.
但是你开车的时候  你有这些反射性的潜意识眼球运动
But you have these reflexive subconscious eye movements that
 从一边到另一边  它们与运动系统有关
go from side to side and they are associated with the motor system.
所以当你往前开的时候
So when you move forward,
你的眼睛是这样的
your eyes go like this.
有许多研究表明 偏侧的眼球运动
There have been a number of studies showing that these lateralized eye movements 
有助于人们摆脱或分离特定创伤的情感体验
helped people move through or dissociate the emotional experience of particular traumas.
这些他们可以发泄的经历
With those experiences such that they could wreak,
治疗后再回忆那些经历 不会再感到有压力
recall those experiences after the treatment and not feel stressed about them,
或者他们不再感觉到他们的创伤
or they didn't report them as traumatic any longer.
但是
Now.
这个成功率
the success,
不是百分之百
it wasn't a hundred per cent,
确实在一些研究中 它们在统计上具有显著意义
but they were statistically significant in a number of studies.
然而 仍然有一些人批评EMDR
And yet there are still some critics of EMDR.
坦白说
and frankly,
有很长的一段时间
for a long time.
我仍然认为
I still thought well,
我也不知道
I don't know.
这看起来像是一种黑客行为
this just seems like kind of a hack.
它的作用机制我们还不知道
it just seems like kind of does something that for which we don't know the mechanism,
我们无法解释
and we can't explain.
但在过去的五年里 至少有五份
But in the last five years there have been no fewer than five,
六份高质量的同行评议论文  发表神经科学杂志 上
and there's a sixth on the way High quality peer reviewed manuscripts published in Journal of Neuroscience,
《Neuron Cell》 一本杂志优秀期刊 《自然》 也是优秀的期刊
Neuron Cell Press Journal Excellent Journal Nature Excellent Journal.
这些非常严格的期刊和论文表明我刚才所做的那种
These are very stringent journals and papers showing that latter realized eye movements 
眼球运动的偏侧化
of the sort that I just did.
如果你只是在听这个播客  就是眼睛从一边转到另一边
and if you're just listening to this is just sweep that moving the eyes from side to side  
眼睛睁着 眼球在运动
with eyes open that those eye movements.
但不是上下的
But not vertical.
眼球运动会抑制了杏仁核的活动
Eye movements suppressed the activity of the amygdala,
这个大脑区域参与了威胁探测
which is this brain region that is involved in threat detection,
压力
stress,
焦虑和恐惧的探测
anxiety and fear.
有一些形式的恐惧不是依赖于杏仁核
There are some forms of fear that are not amygdala dependent,
杏仁核也不是恐惧的中心
but the amygdala it's not a fear center.
但它对恐惧反应和焦虑体验至关重要
But it is critical for the fear response and for the experience of anxiety.
有趣
So that's interesting.
我们有临床工具现在确实显示了很多很多人的成功
We've got a clinical tool now that indeed shows a lot of success in a good number of people 
用眼球的运动 从一边到另一边 会抑制杏仁核
where I movements from side to side or suppressing the amygdala 
用这些眼球运动抑制恐惧反应
and the general theme is to use those eye movements to suppress the fear response and then 
然后重新叙述或重复感受
to recount or repeat the experience 
随着时间的推移 解除沉重的情感负担
and over time uncouple the heavy emotional load,
和悲伤的情绪
the sadness,
抑郁
the depression,
焦虑
the anxiety,
不管发生了什么  产生了创伤
the fear from whatever it was that happened that was traumatic.
理解这一点很重要
This is important to understand,
因为
because.
你知道的
You know,
我很乐意告诉那些有过创伤经历的人  他们可以忘记那段经历
I'd love to be able to tell somebody who had a traumatic experience that they would forget that experience,
但事实是 你永远不会忘记痛苦的经历  你所做的只是消除情感负担
but the truth is you never forget the traumatic experience what you do is you remove the emotional load.
最终它真的会失去作用力
Eventually it really does lose its potency.
情绪的作用力得到了缓解
The emotional potency is alleviated.
我想说的是 EMDR疗法在单个事件中是最成功的
Now EMDR I should just mention tends to be most successful for single event were 
就是反复回想的特定类型的创伤
very specific kinds of trauma that happened over and over,
而不是说
as opposed to say,
一个完整的悲惨童年  或者一整段的离婚
an entire childhood or an entire divorce.
它们往往是
They tend to be.
对单一事件最有效
It tends to be most effective for single event kinds of things,
比如车祸
car crashes,
等等
etc.
人们可以回忆起事件的很多细节
where people can really recall the events in quite a lot of detail.
所以不是每个人都适合
so it's not for everybody,
或者应该这么做
and it should be done.
如果是为了创伤治疗
If it's going to be done for trauma,
应该在临床中进行 由有资质的人来做
it should be done in a clinical setting with somebody who is certified to do this,
但这和快速眼动睡眠有很多相似之处  在我们的睡眠中我们的眼睛
but that bears a lot of resemblance to REM sleep right this experience in our sleep where our eyes,
会动来动去
our movement moving.
不好意思
Excuse me,
尽管是以不同的方式
although in a different way.
但我们没有某些化学物质
But we don't have the chemical.
没有肾上腺素
an epinephrine,
产生恐惧反应的化学物质
In order to generate the fear response,
然而我们却记住了前一天或几天前的事件
and yet we're remembering the event from the previous day or days,
有时在快速眼动睡眠中
sometimes in REM sleep,
我们会想到很久很久以前发生的事情
we think about things happen a long long time ago.
这很有趣
So that's interesting.
现在有了一种新的治疗方法
And then now there's this new treatment.
氯胺酮的化学疗法
this chemical treatment with the drug ketamine,
这也和快速眼动睡眠中发生的事情有很多相似之处
which also bears a lot of resemblance to the sorts of things that happen in REM sleep.
氯胺酮现在受到了很多关注
Ketamine is getting a lot of attention now,
我想  很多人都不知道氯胺酮是什么
and I think a lot of people just don't realize what ketamine is.
氯胺酮是一种解离麻醉剂
Ketamine is a dissociative anaesthetic.
它与一种叫做Pcp的药物非常相似
It is remarkably similar to the drug called Pcp,
是
which.
对人们来说无疑是一种危险的药物
It's certainly a hazardous drug for people to use ketamine and pcp 
它们的作用都是破坏大脑中特定受体的活动
both function to disrupt the activity of a particular receptor in the brain,
称为NMDA受体   n-甲基d-天门冬氨酸受体
called the N M D receptor and n-methyl d-aspartate receptor.
这是一个位于神经元表面的受体
This is a receptor that's in the surface of neurons are on the surface of neurons,
大多数时候
for which most of the time.
它并不活跃
it's not active.
但当极端情况发生时
but when something very extreme happens and there's a lot of activity  
神经回路中有很多活动会影响受体
in the neural pathway that impinges on that receptor,
它会打开
it opens,
它允许分子和离子进入 从而触发一个我们称之为长期增强的细胞过程
and it allows the entry of molecules ions that trigger a cellular process that we call long term potentiation.
长期增强转化为连接上的变化  所以以后你不需要经历同样的强烈事件
and longterm potential nation translates to a change in connectivity so that later you don't need that
就能让神经元再次活跃起来
intense event for the same for the neuron to become active again.
我讲清楚一点
Let me clarify a little bit of this.
NMDA
The nmda,
受体
a receptor,
是由丰富的经验引导的
is guided by intense experience.
你可以这样想 通常我走在家里
One way you can think about this is typically I walk in my home.
我可能会做一些食物 坐在厨房的桌子旁
I might make some food and sit down at my kitchen table,
我不去想爆炸的事
and I don't think anything about explosions.
但如果有天晚上我回到家  坐下来喝鸡汤的时候
but were I to come home one night sit down to a bowl of chicken soup,
然后发生了巨大的爆炸
And there was a massive explosion.
与我餐桌上的鸡汤相关的神经元
The neurons are associated with chicken soup in my kitchen table 
会以一种不同于以前的方式活跃起来
would be active in a way that was different than they were previously.
我们将会和这种爆炸的体验联系在一起 比如下一次
And we'll be coupled to this experience of explosions such that the next time 
或者之后每一次 当我坐在厨房的餐桌旁时
and perhaps every other time that I go to sit down at the kitchen table.
不管我多么理智地了解爆炸的起因
no matter how rational I am about the origins of that explosion,
也许是路边的油罐车
maybe it was a gas truck that was down the road.
它也没有理由还在那里
And there's no reason to think it's there today,
但我也会有同样的经历
but I would have the same experience.
这些神经元会变得活跃 我的心率会再次增加
Those neurons will become active and I'd get an increase in heart rate again
开始出汗
increase in sweating,
等等
etc.
氯胺酮阻断了nmda受体
Ketamine blocks this nmd a receptor 
阻止这种对厨房餐桌汤的交叉的 额外的意义
and prevents that cross over and the addition of meaning to the kitchen table kitchen soup.
不好意思
Excuse me.
阻止对鸡汤和爆炸的交叉的 额外的意义
chicken soup explosion experience.
那么氯胺酮是如何使用的呢
So how is ketamine being used?
氯胺酮被用于在创伤后不久的情绪记忆的阻断
Ketamine is being used to prevent learning of emotions very soon after trauma 
所以氯胺酮在许多不同的急诊室被使用
so ketamine is being stalked in a number of different emergency rooms,
如果人们被带进来
where if people are brought in quickly and you know,
你知道的 这些甚至都很难描述
these are hard to describe,
一个可怕的经历  比如一个人看到他们身边的爱的人死于车祸
even but you know a horrible experience of you know somebody seeing a loved one next to them 
而他们开着那辆车
killed in a car accident and they were driving that car.
这并不适合所有人
This isn't for everybody,
当然
certainly,
你需要和你的医生谈谈
and you need to talk to your physician.
但是一般使用氯胺酮是因为  他们可能会给人注射氯胺酮
But ketamine is being used so they might infuse somebody with ketamine 
这样他们的情绪仍然会发生
so that their emotion is it can still occur.
但是因为这种可塑性
but that the that the plasticity,
他们大脑中回路的变化  大脑开始不让那种强烈的情感依附于这种经历
the change in the wiring of their brain won't allow that intense emotion to be attached to the experience.
现在
Now immediately,
你可以想象这种药物的伦理意义
you can imagine the sort of ethical implications of this right,
因为某些情感需要与经历相结合
because certain emotions need to be coupled to experiences.
我并不是建议人们应该或不应该使用氯胺酮
I'm not saying that people should be using ketamine or shouldn't be using ketamine.
当然不是取乐
Certainly not recreationally,
这是很危险的
it's quite dangerous.
它可能
it does.
它可能是致命的
It can be lethal.
和PCP一样
And like PC P,
它能导致认知和行为上的巨大变化
it can cause pretty dramatic changes in perception and behavior.
但在临床环境中
But in the clinical setting,
氯胺酮的基本作用
the basis of ketamine,
是辅助治疗  是为了消除情绪
assisted therapies are is really to remove emotion.
我觉得我已经听到过很多的公众讨论
and I think the way I've been hearing about it talked about in the general public is 
很多人认为这有点更像是一种愚蠢的裸头草碱试验或NMDA试验
a lot of people think it's a little bit more like the kind of psilocybin trials or the mdm may trials 
而是变得更加情感或获得一定经验
where it's about becoming more emotional or getting in touch with a certain experience.
氯胺酮是一种解离性的药物 也就是从体验的情感成分中分离出来
Ketamine is about becoming dissociative or removed from the emotional component of the experience.
现在我们有了氯胺酮
So now we have ketamine,
它在化学上阻碍了可塑性 阻止了情感和经历之间的联系
which chemically blocks plasticity and prevents that the connection between an emotion and inexperience.
这是一种药物干预
That's a pharmacologic intervention 
我们有EMDR
we have EMDR,
这个眼球运动是用来抑制杏仁核
which is this eye movement thing that is designed to suppress the amygdala 
并消除情感
and is designed to remove emotionality.
回忆过去时的情感  我们快速眼动睡眠中回忆一段经历时 化学物质肾上腺素
while somebody recounts an experience and we have REM sleep where the chemical epinephrine,
可以发出强烈的情绪信号
allows for signaling of intense emotion too.
大脑和身体的强烈情感体验是不允许的
And the experience of intense emotion in the brain and body is not allowed.
所以我们可以开始看到整体的组织逻辑了
And so we're starting to see eight organizational logic,
也就是说 我们睡眠生活的某些部分  就像治疗一样
which is that a certain component of our sleeping life is acting like therapy,
这就是快速眼动睡眠的意义所在
and that's really what REM sleep is about,
所以我们应该认为快速眼动睡眠和慢波睡眠都是至关重要的
so we should really think about REM sleep and slow wave sleep as both critical,
慢波睡眠
slow wave,
用于运动学习和细节学习
sleep or motor learning,
在快速眼动睡眠中学习
a detailed learning REM sleep for attaching of emotions,
特殊经历的情感依附
to particular experiences,
然后确保这些情绪不会依附于错误的经历 并
and then for making sure that the emotions are not attached to the wrong experiences 
在情绪反应过于强烈或严重时忘记它们
and for unlearning emotional responses if they're too intense or severe.
这些都说明了掌握睡眠的重要性
And this all speaks to the great importance of mastering one sleep,
这是我们在播客的第二集讨论过的 我们要确保
something that we talked about in episode two of the podcast and making sure that 
如果生活中出现了由于旅行 压力 学校安排的变化
if life has disruptive events either due to travel or stress or changes in schoolers 
或饮食安排等原因造成的干扰事件
or food schedule something that we talked about,
第三 四期  我们讨论了  人们仍然可以把握好 管理自己的睡眠生活
an episode three and four that one can still grab a hold and manage one's sleep life.
因为从根本上说
Because fundamentally,
忘却那些困扰我们的情绪  是让我们在生活中继续前进的原因
the unlearning of emotions that are troubling to us is what allows us to move forward in life 
而REM睡眠的缺乏
and indeed the REM deprivation.
研究表明 当人们变得过度情绪化的时候
Studies show that people become hyper emotional,
他们的生活会开始走向灾难
they start to catastrophes,
这并不奇怪
and it's no surprise,
因此
therefore,
睡眠障碍与许多情绪和心理障碍有关
That sleep disturbances correlate with so many emotional and psychological disturbances.
从现在开始
It's just by now.
你们应该可以明显地感觉到  其中的道理
It should just be obvious why that would be the case.
事实上
In fact,
前几天我和一个在澳大利亚的同事讨论
the other day I was in a discussion with a colleague of mine who was down in Australia,
莎拉·麦凯博士
Dr Sarah Mckay.
我已经认识她20年了 那时她还在牛津念书
I've known her for two decades now from the time she was at Oxford and Sarah Studies,
尤其是
among other things,
大脑的更年期
menopause in the brain.
她说很多更年期的情绪影响
and she was saying that a lot of the emotional effects of menopause actually 
实际上与荷尔蒙没有直接关系
are not directly related to the hormones.
有一些很好的研究表明在  更年期温度调节的中断
There have been some really nice studies showing that the disruptions in temperature regulation 
与睡眠调节的改变相对应
in menopause map to changes in sleep regulation that 
然后影响情绪  影响无法正确调节情绪相关的回路
then impact emotionality and an inability to correctly adjust the circuits related to emotionality.
我推荐你们看去她的研究  我之后可能会让她来播客当嘉宾
and I encourage you to look at her work will probably have her as a guest on the podcast 
在将来的某个时候 因为她太了解这些问题
at some point in the future because she's so knowledgeable about those sorts of issues 
以及睾丸激素相关的问题
as well as issues related to testosterone and in people 
结合各种不同的染色体的人的背景
with all sorts of different chromosomes backgrounds.
所以睡眠剥夺不仅仅是能量的剥夺
So sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation of energy,
不仅仅是免疫功能被剥夺
it's not just deprivation of immune function,
它还剥夺了我们每次睡觉时的自我诱导治疗
It is deprivation of self induced therapy every time we go to sleep,
那是像EMDR和氯胺酮疗法  这些临床疗法的过程
so these things like EMDR and ketamine therapies are in clinic therapies,
但快速眼动睡眠是每晚入睡时  你都能给自己的治疗过程
but REM sleep is the one that you are giving yourself every night when you go to sleep,
这就提出了
which raises,
我认为另一个很重要的问题
I think the other important question,
也就是如何知道自己是否有了
which is how to get and how to know if you're getting
 相应的快速眼动睡眠和慢波睡眠
the appropriate amount of REM sleep and slow wave sleep.
这就是我们接下来要讨论的
so that's what we'll talk about next.
那么 我们应该如何获得适量的慢波睡眠和快速眼动睡眠
So how should one go about getting the appropriate amount of slow wave sleep and REM sleep 
如何知道自己获得的睡眠量是正确的
and knowing that you're getting the right amount 
不用脑电波的情况下  
well short of hooking yourself up to an EEG.
要精确测量每一晚的大脑状态是很困难的
It's going to be tough to get exact measurements of brain states from night to night.
现在有些人使用欧拉指环  低音带或其他设备
Some people nowadays are using things like the oura ring or a whoop band or some other device 
来测量睡眠质量 深度和持续时间
to measure the quality and depth and duration of their sleep.
对很多人来说
And for many people of those,
这些设备可能非常有用
those devices can be quite useful.
有些人只是通过他们感觉好不好  来衡量他们的睡眠
Some people are only gauging their sleep by way of whether or not they feel rested,
不管有没有觉得自己在学习
whether or not they feel like they're learning,
不管有没有变好
and they're getting better or not.
有一些事情  是大家可以真正做到的
There are some things that one can really do,
鉴于我说过的
and the first one is might surprise you.
还有你听到的  关于睡眠的一切  第一个可能会让你吃惊
In light of everything I've said and probably everything you've heard about sleep.
哈佛大学本科生做过一项研究
There was a study done by a Harvard undergraduate.
艾米丽·霍格兰
I mean Emily Hoagland,
她当时在罗伯特·斯特里格科尔德的实验室里
who was in Robert Strict gold slab at the time.
该研究探索了总睡眠时间的变化与学习的关系
And that study explored how variations in total sleep time related to learning.
与总睡眠时间相比
As compared to total sleep time itself.
总结一下这项研究
And to summarize the study,
他们发现 每晚有规律的睡眠更重要
what they found was that it was more important to have a regular amount of sleep each night,
而不是总持续时间
as opposed to the total duration.
换句话说
In other words,
他们所展示的是学习能力的提高 或者学习障碍
and what they showed was that improvements in learning.
你连续有6 6 5 6个小时的睡眠时间
Or deficits in learning were more related to whether or not you've got 6 hours 6 hours 5 hours 6,
比其他不规律的情况下要更好
That was better than if somebody got,
例如
for instance,
6个小时
six hours,
10个小时
ten hours,
7个小时 然后4-5个小时
seven hours for four or five hours.
你可能会说
She might say.
好吧
Well,
这太疯狂了 因为我还以为我们需要更多的睡眠
that's crazy because I thought we're just also is to get more sleep,
而且临近早晨会有更多的快速眼动睡眠
and there's more REM towards morning.
事实证明 为了学习新知识和在考试中的好的表现
Turns out that forsake of learning new information and performance on exams.
特别是
In particular,
这就是测量的结果
that's what was measured.
限制你的睡眠时间的变化
Limiting the variation in the amount of your sleep is at least as important and perhaps 
至少比获得总的睡眠时间一样重要  或者更重要
more important than just getting more sleep overall,
我认为这会给人们带来很大的安慰
and I think this will bring people great relief.
很多人
Many people,
对那些努力想要得到充足睡眠的人来说 这是莫大的安慰
great relief who are struggling to quote unquote get enough sleep.
还记得几集前
Remember a few episodes ago,
我讲过两者的区别
I talked about the difference between?
疲劳和失眠疲劳往往发生在我们累的时候
Fatigue and insomnia fatigue is tends to be when we are tired.
失眠往往会导致白天的困倦  而晚上却睡不着
Insomnia tends to lead to a sleepiness during the day when we're falling asleep and you don't want that,
这两样你都不想要
you don't want either of those things really.
我发现了一个令人震惊的事实 研究数据确实指出了这样一个事实
I found it striking that the data from the study really point to the fact that 
持续保持相同的睡眠时间  比仅仅获得更多的睡眠更好
consistently getting about the same amount of sleep is better than just getting more sleep.
我认为现在
And I think nowadays,
很多人只是想多睡会儿
so many people are just aiming for more sleep,
他们对只有5个小时
and they're rather troubled about the fact that there are only getting five hours 
或者在某些情况下只有6个小时的睡眠  感到非常担心
or they're only getting six hours in some cases.
可能是他们的确睡眠不足 需要更多的睡眠
It may be the case that they are sleep deprived and they need more sleep,
但有些人只是睡眠需求较低
but some people just have a lower sleep need,
我个人觉得很欣慰的是我持续的是六个小时  六个半小时的睡眠
and I find great relief personally in the fact that consistently getting for me about six hours were six,
要比一直努力睡八 九个小时更有益
and a half hours is going to be more beneficial than constantly striving for eight or nine  
有时我发现自己睡了五个小时
and finding that some nights I'm getting five,
有时我睡了9个小时 波动很大
and sometimes I'm getting nine and varying around the mean as I recall,
我想我要准确地叙述出来
and I think I'm going to get this precisely right.
但如果我没有按照
But if not,
在中间值前后不超过一小时的睡眠时间 睡觉
I know that I'm at least close for every hour variation in sleep,
不管我的睡眠时间是否比一般人多
regardless of whether I was more sleep than one typically got.
在某种特殊的考试类型上 我的成绩下降了17%
There was a seventeen per cent reduction and performance on this particular exam type.
这是很强大的
And so this is powerful.
这意味着我们应该争取有规律的睡眠
This means that we should strive for a regular amount of sleep,
对我们中的一些人来说 这意味着入睡 醒来 然后继续睡觉
and for some of us that means falling asleep and waking up and going back to sleep 
对一些人来说 这意味着入睡 醒来 然后不再继续睡觉
for some people means falling asleep and waking up and not getting back to sleep now.
理想情况下
Ideally,
你在晚上的早些时候  就能得到充分的慢波睡眠 然后快到早上的时候
You're getting the full complement of slow wave sleep early in the night and sleep toward morning,
就是快速眼动睡眠
which is REM sleep,
这就引出了我们如何获得更多的快速眼动睡眠
which brings us to how to get more REM sleep.
好吧
Well,
有几种不同的方法
there are a couple of different ways,
但这里有一些  阻止更多快速眼动睡眠的方法
but here's how to not get more REM sleep.
好
Alright,
首先
first of all,
睡觉前多喝水
drink a lot of fluid right before going to sleep.
我们在半夜醒来上厕所的原因之一
One of the reasons why we wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom is 
就是我们的膀胱满了
because when our bladder is full,
这是一种神经联系
there is a neural connection,
真的是神经回路中有一组神经元  它们进入脑干 把我们唤醒
literally a set of neurons in a nerve circuit that goes to the brain stem that wakes us up 
实际上有些人 我知道  我不会提到名字
and actually some people that I know I won't be mentioned 
当他们想要保持清醒的时候 用这个来调整她的时差
as she used this to try to adjust their for their jet lag when they're trying to stay awake.
上厕所小便是最让人焦虑的事情之一
having to use the bathroom have any urinate is one of the most anxiety,
唤起了任何人都有的体验
evoking experiences anyone can have.
如果你真的要上厕所
If you really have to go to the bathroom,
那就很难入睡  或保持睡眠状态
it's very hard to fall asleep or stay asleep and bed.
还有尿床
wetting,
这种情况发生在儿童很小的时候   是这些大脑回路的运作失败  直到成熟之后才不会
Which happens in kids very early on is a failure of those circuits to maturation into mature.
直到
Until you know,
我想我们都认为婴儿会在他们睡觉时尿尿
I think we all assume that babies are going to you are going to pee in their sleep,
但成年人不应该这样做 而且大脑回路需要一些时间来发展
but adults aren't supposed to do that and the circuits take some time to develop it.
有些孩子的发育要比其他人晚一些
In some kids they develop a little bit later than others,
所以膀胱太满  是扰乱睡眠的一个问题
so having a full bladder is one way to disrupt your sleep.
你又不想脱水睡觉
You don't want to go to bed dehydrated,
但这是一种方式
but that's one way.
另一方面
On the other hand,
有证据表明 如果你想更多地记住你的梦 或者更多地记住你的梦
there is evidence that if you want to remember your dreams more or remember more of your dreams,
你可以使用一个工具
there is a tool that you can use.
我并不推荐
I don't necessarily recommend it,
那就是睡觉前喝一大堆水
which is to drink a bunch of water before you go to sleep.
然后你就会频繁地进出快速眼动睡眠
and then what happens is you tend to break in and out of REM sleep,
这些梦容易断裂 而且可以通过睡眠日记
it tends to be fractured and with a sleep journal.
他们做了这些实验室研究
then they've done these laboratory studies.
信不信由你
believe it or not,
人们会回忆起更多的梦 因为他们处于这种半意识状态
people will recall more of their dreams because they're in this kind of semiconscious state 
因为他们整夜都在不停地醒来
because they're constantly waking up throughout the night.
我建议睡觉前不要憋尿
I suggest not having a full bladder before you go to sleep,
这个答案很明显
that one's kind of an obvious one,
但另一个是
but nonetheless the other one is.
如果你还记得  在快速眼动睡眠期间
If you recall that during REM sleep,
我们的神经递质发生了变化 我们的神经递质减少了
we have a shift in neurotransmitters such that we have less.
血清素 不好意思我只是想确认一下  就是血清素更少
Serotonin or I just want to make sure I got their rights gives me less serotonin.
有很多补剂都是为了改善睡眠
There are a lot of supplements out they're geared toward improving sleep.
我会服用一些
I've taken some of them and adopting many of them,
即使不是全部
if not all of them at this point,
这样我才能向你汇报
so I could report back to you,
我想我在上一集提到过  当我服用色氨酸
and I think I mentioned in a previous episode that when I take tryptophan 
以及包含5-htp的补剂
or anything that contains five htp,
也就是血清素或血清素的前体
which is serotonin or a precursor to serotonin,
血清素是由色氨酸合成的
serotonin is made from tryptophan.
我往往睡得很沉 然后几个小时后就醒了
I tend to fall very deeply asleep and then wake up a few hours later.
基于你不想在一开始就有大量快速眼动睡眠的事实 这样做是有道理的
And that makes sense now based on the fact that you just don't want a lot of REM sleep early on.
当我在早期进入大量快速眼动睡眠时  最可能发生的是什么呢
What was probably happening as I was getting a lot of REM sleep early on.
因为低水平的血清素通常与慢波睡眠有关
because low levels of serotonin are typically associated with slow wave sleep,
这种情况在晚上很早就出现了
and that comes early in the night.
所以对一些人来说
So for some people,
这些补品可能会起作用
those supplements might work.
但要注意 补充血清素可能会扰乱快速眼动睡眠和慢波睡眠的时间
But beware serotonin supplements at could disrupt the timing of REM sleep and slow wave sleep,
就我而言
and in my case,
会导致入睡后很快醒来 无法再入睡
led to waking up very shortly after going to sleep and not being able to get back to sleep.
那么
Now,
如果你想增加慢波睡眠
if you want to increase your slow wave sleep,
很有趣
that's interesting.
有很多方法可以做到这一点
There are ways to do that.
增加慢波睡眠  慢波睡眠的占比
One of the most powerful ways to increase slow wave sleep,
最有效的方法之一
the percentage of slow wave sleep.
显然 在不影响睡眠和学习的其他因素的情况下
Apparently without any disruption to the other components of sleep and learning 
就是进行抗阻负重运动
is to engage in resistance exercise.
很明显 抗阻负重运动触发了一系列新陈代谢和内分泌回路
It's pretty clear that resistance exercise triggers a number of metabolic and endocrine pathways
这些回路有助于释放生长激素
that lend themselves to release of growth hormone,
在晚上的早些时候进行抗阻运动
which happens early in the night and resistance exercise,
之后
therefore,
能诱发更大比例的慢波睡眠
can induce a greater percentage of slow wave sleep.
不是一定要在接近睡觉前完成
It doesn't have to be done very close to going to bed time,
事实上
in fact,
对于一些人来说 这种运动可能会造成睡不好 原因我在之前的章节中已经谈到过
for some people that the exercise could be disruptive for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes.
但抗阻负重运动
But resistance exercise,
不像有氧运动
unlike aerobic exercise,
确实增加了慢波睡眠的时间
does seem to increase the amount of slow wave sleep which,
正如我们所知
as we know,
参与了运动学习和细节信息的获取
is involved in motor learning and the acquisition of fine detailed information,
而不是一般规则或情感组成的经历
not general rules or the emotional components of experiences.
对于那些对清醒梦感兴趣
For those of you that are interested in lucid dreaming 
并想要增加清醒梦次数的人
and would like to increase the amount of lucid dreaming that you're experiencing.
我没能找到我在节目一开始所说的那个红灯设备
I haven't been able to track down that device with the red light that I described at the beginning.
但是原则上有很多简单的零技术工具可以使用
But there are a number of just simple zero technology tools that one could use in principle.
一种是设置提示
One is to set a cue.
它的工作原理是 你想出一个简单的叙述
The way this works is you come up with a simple statement about something 
关于你以后想在梦中看到或经历的事情
that you'd like to see or experience later in dreams you can,
比如
for instance,
写下来
write down,
我想记住红苹果
you know something like I want to remember the red apple.
我知道听起来可能有点愚蠢和单调
I know sound silly and trivial,
你看着这个
and you look at that.
你可能会想把它写在一张纸上 你甚至可能想画一个红苹果
You would probably want to write it down on a piece of paper you might even want to draw a red apple,
在你睡觉前
and then before you go to sleep,
看着它
you would look at it,
然后你再去睡觉
and then you would just go to sleep.
有报道称 连续几天这样做 会导致一种情况
There are some reports that doing that for several days in a row can lead to a situation in which
 突然在你的梦中 你记得红苹果
you are suddenly in your dream and you remember the red apple 
这在现实中  给你一种与梦境之间的现实联系
and that gives you a sort of tether to reality between the dream state and reality
这可以让你在其中调整 调整你的梦想
that allows you to navigate in shape and kind of adjust your dreams.
清醒梦并不一定能够有改变梦境特征的能力
Lucid dreaming does not have to be or include the ability to alter features of the dream you know 
不能够控制梦中事物
to be able to control things in the dream.
有时只是你意识到自己在做梦
Sometimes it's just the awareness that you are dreaming.
但尽管如此
But nonetheless,
有些人喜欢清醒梦
some people enjoy lucid,
然后对那些做很多清醒梦的人来说 他们会觉得有些不知所措
dreaming and then for people that have a lot of lucid dreams that feel kind of overwhelmed by those
 因为那些梦会涉及到尝试采用一些方法来设定正确的睡眠时间
that's going to involve trying to embrace protocols that can set the right duration of sleep.
有一些文献
There's a little bit of literature,
不是很多 表明  保持每晚的从开始到结束的连续六个小时睡眠
Not a lot that that shows that keeping the total amount of sleep per night to the big two say six hours 
比如开始睡觉  到一个昼夜周期的结束
such that you begin sleeping end at the beginning and end of one of these ultradian cycles 
可以比在半夜醒来一个昼夜周期 睡得更好
can be better than waking up in the middle of one of these old trading in cycles.
所以
So.
试着找到你所需要的睡眠时间
Try and find the right amount of sleep that you need.
这对你来说很好 然后今晚试着这样吧
that's right for you and then try and get that consistently night tonight.
如果你是一个清醒梦者 你不喜欢这样
If you're a lucid dreamer and you don't like it,
然后 你可能想要开始确保你在这些昼夜周期的结束时醒来
then you may want to start to make sure that your waking up at the end of one of these altrurian cycle.
所以在这种情况下 最好在6小时后醒来 而不是7小时后
So in this case it would be better to wake up after six hours than after seven.
如果你的睡眠时间超过6个小时
And if you did sleep longer than six hours,
那最好睡七个半小时
maybe you'd want to get to seven and a half hours because 
因为这将是九十分钟周期的一个结束
that's going to reflect the end of one of these ninety minutes cycles,
而不是中途醒来
as opposed to waking up in the Middle.
酒精
Alcohol,
众所周知 酒精和大麻会导致假性睡眠状态
alcohol and marijuana are well known to induce states that are pseudo sleep,
尤其是当人们在饮酒或吸食四氢大麻酚后睡着的时候
like especially when people fall asleep while after having consumed alcohol or THC.
其中的活性成分
The active component.
大麻中的一种活性成分
One of the active components in marijuana.
酒精THC  以及大多数
Alcohol THC and most?
这种东西
Things like them,
也就是增加血清素或Gaba的物质
meaning things that increase serotonin or Gaba,
会扰乱睡眠模式
are going to disrupt the pattern of sleep they're going to disrupt.
深度将会打乱整体的顺序
The depth are going to disrupt the overall sequencing of 
即早期的慢波睡眠  和晚期的快速眼动睡眠
more slow wave sleep early in the night and more REM sleep later in the night.
这就是现实
That's just the reality.
有些事情
There are some things that,
至少在我能找到的一些研究中
at least in a few studies that I could find seem to just that
 你可以增加慢波睡眠的时间 使用精氨酸
you could increase the amount of slow wave sleep using things like arginine,
氨基酸精氨酸
the amino acid arginine.
但是你要提前去检查一下
Although you really want check,
精氨酸是否会导致影响心脏
our gene can have effects on heart,
等等
etc.
还有其他的影响 但是酒精对睡眠和睡眠深度没有好处
has other effects but alcohol thc not going to be great for sleep and depth of sleep.
你可能会觉得自己能更快入睡
You might feel like you can fall asleep faster,
但你进入的睡眠并不是那种深度的
but the sleep that you're accessing really isn't the kind of deep,
不是你真正需要的那种
restorative sleep that you should be getting now.
当然
Of course,
如果这是你睡觉所需要的
if that's what you need in order to sleep,
这在你们的方案中
and that's within your protocol.
就像我之前说的
As I've said here before,
我并不是建议大家都吃一个东西
I'm not suggesting people take anything.
我不是医生
I'm not a medical doctor,
我不是警察
I'm not a cop,
所以我不会去规范任何人的行为
so I'm not turn to regulate anyone's behavior.
我只是告诉你文献上所说的
I'm just telling you what the literature says.
你们中的一些人可能想要探索你的梦和梦的意义
Some of you may want to explore your dreams and meaning of dreams,
等等
etc.
你知道 关于如何做到这一点并没有很多确凿的数据
You know there's not a lot of hard data about how to do this,
但很多人都说自己写了睡眠日记   这些梦境日记非常有用
but a lot of people report keeping a sleep journal where a dream journal can be very useful,
所以他们自己前一天晚上睡前  会做标记
so they mark when they think they fell asleep the night before when they woke up.
如果他们在半夜或者清晨醒来
And if they wake up in the middle of the night early in the morning,
他们只会写下他们能回忆起的梦
they'll just write down what they can recall of their dreams.
即使他们什么都想不起来
and even if they recall nothing,
很多人都有过上午或下午晚些时候突然会想起来
many people have the experience of midmorning or later afternoon that suddenly comes to them,
他们做了一个和写下来的东西相关的梦
that they had a dream about something in writing.
我记了一篇梦境日记
That down I kept a dream journal,
虽然它给我的线索不多
for while it didn't really afford me much,
我什么都没学到  除了我的梦很奇怪
I didn't really learn anything except to my dreams were very bizarre.
与慢波睡眠相比
There are some things that happen in dreams that are associated with REM sleep 
REM睡眠中发生的一些事情
as he compared to slow wave sleep,
它可以告诉你你的梦是发生在快速眼动睡眠还是慢波睡眠中
which can tell you whether or not your dream likely happened in REM sleep or slow wave sleep
它的显著特征是
and the distinguishing feature it turns out,
是一种叫做心灵理论的东西它实
is something called Theory of mind through your mind is actually 
际上是为了研究和评估自闭症而发展出来的
an idea that was developed for the study and assessment of autism.
最初的短语理论是由西蒙·拜伦·科恩提出的
and it was initially that phrase theory of mine was brought about by Simon Baron Cohen,
他是萨沙·拜伦·科恩
who is Sasha Baron Cohen.
这位喜剧演员的哥哥  西蒙·拜伦·科恩是一位心理学家
The comedians brother Simon Baron Cohen is a psychologist.
在某种程度上
and to some extent,
他是牛津大学的神经学家 研究心理理论
a neuroscientist at Oxford and theory of mind.
测试对象是儿童和心理理论
Tests are done on children and the theory of mind.
一些
Tesco is some.
像下面这样
What like the following.
一个孩子
A child,
被带进实验室  让他们看
is brought into a laboratory and watches,
另一个孩子玩某种玩具的视频
a video of a child playing with some sort of toy,
然后在玩完那个玩具后
and then at the end of playing with that toy.
他们把玩具放在抽屉里 走开了 然后另一个孩子进来四处张望
they put the toy in a drawer and they go away and then another child comes in and is looking around.
然后实验者问参与实验的孩子
And then the experimenter asks the child who's in the experiment.
问看视频的孩子
The real child says,
恩
You know,
视频中后面进来的孩子在想什么
What does the child think you know?
他们有什么感觉
What are they feeling?
对于大多数特定年龄的孩子
And most children of a particular age,
五六岁或更大的人会说
five or six or older will say,
哦
Oh,
他或她在困惑
you know he or she is confused.
他们不知道玩具在哪里
They don't know where the toy is,
或者他们会说一些暗示  我们所说的心理理论的东西
or they'll say something that implies what we call theory of mind that 
他们可以把别人想法放进自己的脑子里
they can put their ideas into in their mind into what 
放到另一个孩子可能感觉到或经历到  心理理论的东西里
the other child is likely to be feeling or experiencing that theory of mind.
这被用作自闭症的评估之一
And it turns out that this is used as one of the assessments for autism.
因为有些孩子 不是所有的孩子
because some children not all but some children
 而是一些患有自闭症或发展为自闭症的孩子  没有这种心智理论
that have autism or that go on to develop autism don't have this theory of mind.
他们总是盯着第一个孩子把玩具放进抽屉的事实不放
They tend to fixate on the fact that the first child put the toy in the drawer.
他们会说在抽屉里
They'll say it's in the drawer,
而不是回答这个问题
as opposed to answering the question,
第二个孩子是什么感觉
which is how does the second child feel about it?
或者他们在经历什么
or what are they experiencing?
因此 心智理论是在生命早期出现的东西
So theory of mind is something that is emerges early in life 
它是与情绪学习和社会互动相关的
as a part of the maturation of the circuits in the brain associated 
大脑回路成熟的一部分
with emotional learning and social interactions,
我们体验这种断片的梦
and we experience this inserting dreams.
所以如果你做了一个很困惑的梦
So if you had a dream that you're puzzled about her,
你一直在想它
that you're fixated on and you're thinking about,
你可以问问你自己  在那个梦里
you might ask in that dream.
我是在评估别人的情绪和感受吗
Was I assessing somebody else's emotion and feeling,
还是说 我基本上是在用第一人称  这种倾向就是
or was I very much in my own first person experience and that the tendency is that 
心理理论在REM的梦境中的反应
theory of mind tends to show up most in these REM associated dreams.
不是所有都这样
Now this isn't a hard and fast rule,
但是很有可能
but chances are,
如果你在梦里想着其他人想对你做什么
if you are in a dream and you were thinking about other people who wanted to do something to you,
你在想他们想要追逐你  或帮助你
you are thinking about their desire to chase you or help you,
或者是与他人的情感体验有关的东西
or something that was really relate to someone else's emotional experience.
那基本上就是在快速眼动睡眠中做梦
It was probably a REM dream that dream occurred in rapid eye movement sleep 
与慢波睡眠相反
as opposed to slow wave sleep.
而当你想到REM在情绪上有解除对特定生活事件的联想的作用时  这就说得通了
And that makes sense when you think about the role of REM in emotional unlearning of 
快速眼动中充满了各种各样的探索
associations with particular life events that REM is rich with all sorts of exploration of 
比如被追赶的情绪负荷  或者第二天考试的情绪负荷
the emotional load of being chased or the emotional load of having to take an exam.
有事迟到了等等
The next day were being late for something.
但是
But again,
如果你想着这个
if you're fixated,
或者你可以回忆起对别人动机的很多想法或感受
Or you can recall thinking a lot about or feeling a lot about what somebody else's motivations were.
那你很可能是在REM中
then chances are it was in REM.
如果没有
and if not,
很可能是在慢波睡眠中
chances are it was in slow wave sleep.
今天
Today,
我们深入讨论了睡眠和做梦
we've been in a deep dive of sleep and dreaming,
学习和遗忘
learning and unlearning,
我想重述一些重点和要点
and I just want to recap a few of the highlights and important points.
夜晚的早期  你的睡眠中更多的是慢波睡眠  REM更少
A lot more slow wave sleep in less ram early in the night,
夜晚的晚期 更多的是REM  慢波睡眠更少
more ram and less slow wave sleep later in the night.
快速眼动睡眠与没有化学物质肾上腺素的强烈体验有关
REM sleep is associated with intense experiences without this chemical.
让我们产生焦虑或恐惧的肾上腺素
epinephrine that allows us the anxiety or fear,
几乎可以肯定的是 它在 将情感与我们每晚经历的自我诱导疗法 分离方面
and almost certainly has an important role in uncoupling of emotion from experiences 
起着重要作用
of self induced therapy that 
自我诱导疗法与EMDR和氯胺酮疗法等
we go into each night that bears a striking resemblance to things like EMDR 
有着惊人的相似之处
and ketamine therapies and so forth.
慢波睡眠至关重要
Slow wave sleep is critical,
然而
however.
它对运动学习和特定细节的学习至关重要
It's critical mostly for motor learning and the learning of specific details.
REM是一种关于情绪 一般的经历和意义
So REM is kind of emotions and general themes and meaning
 而慢波睡眠
and slow wave sleep,
重在运动学习和细节学习
motor learning and details.
我个人觉得持续的睡眠
I personally find it fascinating that consistency of sleep,
也就是说每晚睡6个小时比每晚睡10个小时要好
meaning getting six hours every night is better than getting ten one night,
接下来是八小时
eight,
接下来5小时
the next five,
以此类推
the next for the next.
我觉得这很有趣
I find that fascinating,
我喜欢它的另一个原因是我可以更好地控制它 而不是试图多睡觉
and I think I also like it because it's something I can control better than just trying to sleep more,
我想我并不是唯一一个同意这一点的人  只是很多人都很难做到
which I think I'm not alone in agreeing that that's just hard for a lot of people to do.
这一集也把我们带到了连续五集的结尾
This episode also brings us to the conclusion of a five episodes streak 
在这五集里我们一直在关注睡眠以及在睡眠和清醒的转换
where we've been focusing on sleep and transitions in and out of sleep.
NSDR
non sleep deep rest.
我们已经讨论了很多工具
We've talked about a lot of tools.
早晨的阳光
morning light,
晚上的光线
evening light,
避免灯光
avoiding lights,
防蓝光设备  补剂
blue blockers supplements tools for measuring sleep,
测量睡眠时间和质量的工具
duration and quality.
我们已经讨论了很多主题
We've been covering a lot of themes.
我希望 到目前为止 你已经拥有了许多工具和信息
I like to think that by now you're armed with a number of tools and information.
知道什么时候是你的最低体温就  知道你什么时候想看光线
Things like knowing when your temperature minimum is knowing when you might want to view life or not
 什么时候能吃东西 什么时候想洗热水澡 什么时候想洗冷水澡
when you might want to eat or take hot showers or God forbid a cold shower,
包括我在内的大多数人或多或少都讨厌的东西
something that most people including me more or less loathed,
但也有一定的好处
but can have certain benefits,
这将帮助你塑造你的睡眠生活  并在规律的基础上
and that will allow you to shape your sleep life and get this 
获得或多或少一致的睡眠时间
consistent or more or less consistent amount of sleep on a regular basis.
没有人有完美的睡眠
Nobody's perfect that day.
我有讲小笑话 虽然我说的时候它一点都不好笑
I have this little joke that I sometimes tell it's not funny,
就像我讲的大多数笑话一样
like most of the jokes I tell I'm told,
不好笑
are not funny,
但你知道现在人们对间歇性禁食很感兴趣
but you know there's so much excitement now about intermittent fasting.
有时候我觉得  应该有人对间歇性睡眠剥夺感到警惕
Sometimes I think that someone should startling on Iintermittent sleep deprivation,
尽管我们已经时不时地经历睡眠不足
although we're already doing that where we are all experiencing lack of sleep from time to time,
但我不认为我们应该把小问题
and I don't think we should catastrophe.
放大太多
Is that too much?
我认为我们要做的  不是积累睡眠焦虑
I think that what we want to do rather than accumulate a sleep anxiety is to,
你知道的
you know,
如果我们一夜没睡好
if we get a bad night's sleep,
我们应该是想着去调整
we want to adjust,
去回到正轨 保持稳定的睡眠时间
We want to get back on track and just get the consistent amount of sleep.
当我们感到焦虑或半夜难以醒来时
Use those non sleep deep rest protocols to help us relax 
使用那些NSDR方法来帮助我们放松
when we're feeling anxious were having trouble waking up in the middle of the night.
有很多工具
There are a lot of tools out there,
大部分都是零成本的
and most of them are zero cost,
所以如果你在这一集一直听到科斯特洛的鼾声 我希望你没有什么问题
and so I hope you'll find those beneficial if you've been hearing Costello snoring throughout this episode.
我替他道歉
I apologise in his behalf.
正如我在欢迎视频中所说
As I said in the welcome video out of this podcast,
他是播客不可或缺的一部分
he's an integral part of the podcast.
有些人可能会说
A few people have said,
嘿
Hey,
这背景噪音真的太吵了
that noise in the background is really disruptive.
嘿
Hey,
我还能说什么呢
what can I say?
科斯特洛是一只10岁的斗牛犬
Castella is a ten year old bulldog mastiff.
而这些动物的寿命大约是10年
The lifespan on those animals is about ten years,
我不是想让你觉得内疚
so I'm not trying to make you feel guilty,
但你知道在他走后
but you know after he's gone,
就不会有鼾声了
there won't be any snoring,
不过我可能会换一只狗
although I'll probably get a different dog.
所以
so sort of.
就如同现在小孩说的那样
what are the kids say?
对不起
Sorry,
但也不是
not sorry,
不好意思
Sorry,
但不为鼾声感到抱歉
not sorry about the snoring,
如果这真的很吵 我很抱歉
and I'm sorry if it's disruptive genuinely butt.
嗯
Ah,
他要在这里待上很久
he is here for for the haul.
这就是它的意义所在
So that's what that's about.
当我们结束这一段关于睡眠的内容时
As we close out this segment on sleep,
我们会进入一个新的主题和话题
we are moving into a new theme and topic.
在接下来的四五集里
For the next four or five episodes.
我们将讨论与神经可塑性相关的科学和工具
we are going to discuss the science and the tools related to neural plasticity.
神经可塑性是神经系统的一个显著特征
Neural plasticity is a remarkable feature of the nervous system.
事实上
In fact,
这是神经系统的决定性特征
it's the defining feature of the nervous system,
这是它根据经验而改变自身的能力
which is its ability to change itself in response to experience 
这种能力不同于我们身体的其他组织和细胞和器官
that is unlike every other tissue and collection of cells and organ in our body.
这是我们作为一个人类物种的真正原因
It's really what makes us us as a species in it.
它使我们成为个体
it's what makes us us as individuals,
这就是我们的潜力所在
and it's really where our potential lies,
我们知道的一切  我们能做的一切
everything that we know everything we can do,
而我们真正的潜能 也就是我们在生活中所能了解和表达的东西
and our true potential in terms of what we will ever be able to know do say in life 
是受到神经可塑性的限制的
is set by the limits of neural plasticity.
所以我们将探索学习 童年和成年的学习
so we're going to explore learning and childhood learning and adulthood.
我们将讨论与感觉可塑性相关的详细方法
We're going to discuss detailed protocols as they relate to sensory plasticity,
学习新的感觉信息与运动可塑性  或把感觉和运动相结合
learning new sensory information versus motor plasticity or sensory motor integration.
我们会讲到语言学习
We're going to talk about language acquisition.
我们会从广义上讨论情感获得
We're going to be talking about emotional acquisition in breadth 
我想很多人会觉得这个话题
as well as I think the topic a lot of people are going to find.
很吸引人
fascinating.
比如童年时期的社会关系的可塑性
Is the relationship between plasticity set during childhood,
对父母或抚养者的依恋  以及这种依恋如何映射到成年人际关系中
attachment to parent or other caregiver and how that maps onto adult relationships.
你们很多人可能听说过安全的依恋类型  或者危险的依恋类型
There are many of you have probably heard about secure attached or insecure.
把AB和CD婴儿放在一起对比 这是Bowlby和其他人的经典研究
Attach the A B and C d babies as they're called from the classic studies of Bowlby and others.
但现在有神经科学可以告诉我们
But now there's actual neuroscience that can say 
哪些回路在孩童的生活依恋中是活跃的
which circuits were active during those early life attachment,
以及这些与成人依恋类型的关系
and how those map to adult attachment styles,
其中的挑战  以及是什么让我们更有可能选择特定的伴侣和依恋类型
challenges and what makes us more likely to select certain partners and styles of attachment,
以及如何改变这些
as well as how to change those.
真的很有意思
It's really fascinating.
我认为神经科学随着时间的推移对神经可塑性有一定的影响
And I think neuroscience as time has calm for neural plasticity,
我们还会讲到
we're also going to talk,
当然
of course,
关于补剂 化学物质 机器和设备
about supplements and chemicals and machines and devices 
这些都可以帮助加速可塑性过程 不管你信不信
that can assist in speeding up the plasticity process or believe or not.
在一些情况下 你可能想要延迟可塑性
There are some cases where you might want to delay plasticity 
以便获得更深入的学习 让学习持续更长时间
in order to get more depth of learning and have that learning last longer,
这是非常强大的
something that is just absolutely spectacular.
真的
Literature,
所以我很高兴很快就能进入这个话题
so I'm very excited to move on to that topic soon.
我希望你到目前为止所获得的工具和知识
I hope that the tools that you've acquired so far in the knowledge you've acquired so far 
能帮助你自我评价  在你认为合适的地方自我实验
is helping you with your self evaluation and experimentation as you see fit and is allowing you to 
让你不仅睡得更好 在清醒时感觉更好
not just sleep better but feel better while you're awake 
一旦我们开始讨论神经可塑性之后
and hopefully has set the stage for you to learn better.
更希望能为你更好地学习提供支持
As we start to march into the month on neural plasticity,
很多人都问过如何支持HubermanLab播客
many of you have asked how you can help support the HubermanLab podcast,
我们非常感谢你的问题 如果你还没有订阅Youtube频道
and we greatly appreciate the question you can help support the podcast 
你可以帮助我们支持播客
by subscribing to the Youtube channel if you haven't already 
并在评论部分留下评论和问题
and leaving comments and questions in the comments section,
如果你能订阅Apple和Spotify
if you could subscribe on Apple and or Spotify,
这也很有帮助 在苹果播客上有一个地方可以留下评分
that's helpful and there's a place on Apple podcasts to leave a rating,
还有关于你对播客的看法的评论
as well as comments about how you feel about the podcast 
如果你能把播客推荐给朋友  同事
if you could suggest the podcast of friends and coworkers
 或者任何你认为能从信息中受益的人
and anyone else that you think would benefit from the information that 
也能帮助我们传播信息
also really helps us get the word out and of course,
也可以看一下我们的赞助商
check out our sponsors,
因为这是一种非常直接的方式 可以帮助我们继续将这些信息传达给公众
Because that's a very direct way to help us continue to get this information out to the general public.
很多人都问过补剂的问题  问我个人从哪里得到的补剂
Many of you have asked about supplements and where I personally get my supplements,
我和Thorn合作  我从Thorn那里得到补品  因为
I've partnered with thorn and I get my supplements from thorn because,
在我看来
by my view,
他们有最高水平的严格生产和精确的把控
they have the highest level of stringency and precision in terms of what's in the bottle.
他们也有很多
and they also have very,
非常高的质量标准
very high quality standards.
他们与梅奥诊所合作  和所有主要的体育组织合作
They're partnered with the Mayo Clinic and all the major sports organizations.
如果你想试试Thorn的补品
If you want to try thorn supplements,
你可以登陆thorn.com/huberman
you can go to thorn dot com
如果你这么做了
and if you do that,
你可以看到我使用的补给方案
you can see the formulations that I take,
还可以打八折
and you'll also get twenty per cent off,
不仅仅是那些补给方案
not just those formulations,
而是他们公司能给的所有东西
but anything that thorn makes.
thorn.com/huberman 得到20%的折扣 他们提供的任何东西
thorn.com/huberman to get twenty per cent off anything that they provide.
最后
Last but not least,
一些人给我发消息 对我在之前的播客中说过的话提出了一些问题
a few people wrote to me with some questions slash corrections about things 
或者进行了一些更正
that I said in previous podcasts,
所以为了保持我的目标 让信息准确和清晰
So in keeping with my goal of making the information accurate and clear,
我想纠正一下我之前说的话
I just want to correct myself about a few things that I said.
其中一个我猜可能是内分泌学家
One of those and I'm guessing it probably came from an endocrinologist 
或者其他对睾丸有研究的人说的
or somebody else that knows a lot about testicles said.
你提到睾丸素是由睾丸的睾丸细胞产生的
Huberman you mentioned that testosterone is made by the search holy cells of the testes,
它不是  它是由睾丸的莱氏细胞产生的
and it's not it's made by the leydig cells of the testes.
是的  你是对的
And indeed you are correct.
所以我想跟大家确认一下 睾丸素是由睾丸的莱氏细胞产生的
And so I want to make sure that I clarify that testosterone is made by the lighting cells of the testes,
这不是完全的细胞对性细胞
not by this are totally cells to sexually cells.
产生5α-还原酶
Make five alpha reductase and aromatase 
芳香化酶和其他一些酶参与睾酮转化为dhd
and some other enzymes involved in conversion of testosterone into things like dhd,
一种雌激素
an estrogen.
谢谢你的纠正
So thank you for that correction.
我真的很感激
I genuinely appreciate it.
我还说错了一件事 就是
I misspoke the other thing I said was at one point,
我说
I said.
典型温度为96.8华氏度
Typical temperature is ninety,
其实我想说的是98.6华氏度
six point eight when I actually meant to say ninety eight point six,
所以这是我说错了
so it was a dyslexic slip on my part,
我道歉
and I apologize.
我不知道我是否有诵读困难症
I don't know that I'm dyslexic.
我说的是临床诊断那种真的症状
I know I mean clinically diagnosed with this,
我有点害怕
I scared,
我替换了两个数字
but I swapped them,
当我读得很快的时候就会这样
which sometimes happens when I'm going fast.
所以我道歉
so I apologize.
我要用这个时间来说明昼夜体温变化很大
I'll use this as a moment to just say temperature varies a lot across the day and night.
这是上一期播客的主题
That was a theme of previous podcast.
所以我们不能讨论平均温度
so we can't really talk about average temperature anyway.
但我想澄清的是 大多数人认为的平均温度是98.6华氏度
But I do want to be clear that most people think about average temperature as ninety eight point six,
我说错了 我道歉
I misspoke my error and I apologize.
感谢大家和我一起踏上神经系统生物学之旅
Thank you for joining me in this journey of the nervous system in biology 
试图了解构造我们的机制
and trying to understand the mechanisms that make us who we are 
以及了解我们在睡眠和清醒时是分别如何运作的
and how we function in sleep and wakefulness.
这真是一段不可思议的旅程
It's really an incredible landscape to consider,
我希望你能从中得到很多信息
and I hope that you are getting a lot out of the information.
一如既往
As always.
谢谢你对科学的兴趣
Thank you for your interest in science.
