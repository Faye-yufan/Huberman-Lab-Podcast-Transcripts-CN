-欢迎来到Huberman Lab播客  
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
我们在这里讨论科学
where we discuss science
和用于日常生活的基于科学的工具
and science-based tools for everyday life.
字幕翻译/压制：Faye就是帆妹
我是Andrew Huberman  
I'm Andrew Huberman,
我是神经生物学和眼科教授
and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
在斯坦福医学院
at Stanford School of Medicine.
此播客是
This podcast is separate
与我在斯坦福大学的教学和研究角色分开来的
from my teaching and research roles at Stanford,
但是  这是我渴望和努力的一部分
it is, however, part of my desire and effort
给消费者带来零成本的信息
to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information
关于科学和与科学有关的工具
about science and science-related tools
给所有公众
to the general public.
在我们今天开始之前  只想告知一下
Before we begin today, just want to acknowledge
如果你正在YouTube上观看此视频  
that if you're watching this on YouTube,
是的  我的脸左侧有绷带  
yes, I have a bandage on the left side of my face,
我当时正尝试为Costello和我做饭
I was trying to cook something for Costello and I
我被烫着了  被自己烫到了  那是一次烹饪事故
and I got burned, burned myself, it was a cooking accident.
我很好  无需赘述  我们可以继续前进  
I'm fine, no need to dwell on it, we can move on,
但我只是想让你知道
but I just wanted to let you know
我们俩都没事的  
everybody's going to be okay,
他吃了一顿美餐  我被烫到了  但是也吃了一顿美餐
he got a great meal, I got a burn and a great meal.
今天的一集是由Four Sigmatic带给我们的
Today's episode is brought to us by Four Sigmatic.
Four Sigmatic是一家保健公司
Four Sigmatic is a wellness company
制作蘑菇咖啡
that makes mushroom coffee.
对于那些还没有听说过的人
For those of you that haven't heard
之前的蘑菇咖啡
of mushroom coffee before,
我只想说清楚
I just want to make clear,
这些不是迷幻蘑菇
these are not psychedelic mushrooms,
不  咖啡的味道根本不像蘑菇
and no, the coffee does not taste like mushrooms at all.
它的味道令人赞叹  它的味道像咖啡
It tastes amazing and it tastes like coffee.
几年前  我开始使用Four Sigmatic咖啡
I started using Four Sigmatic coffee a few years ago
然后我们实际上将它囤在我的实验室中  
and then we actually stocked it in my lab,
我们仍然在我的实验室里存货
we still stock it in my lab
因为味道真的很好
because it tastes really good
而且恰好里面有两种蘑菇
and it also happens to have two types of mushrooms in it
我特别喜欢
that I particularly like
由于它们的补品和药用特性  
because of their supplement and medicinal qualities,
一个是猴头菇
and those two are lion's mane mushroom,
在一些研究中已经表明
which has been shown in several research studies
它具有轻微的抗焦虑作用  即抗焦虑作用  
to have a mild anxiolytic, meaning anti-anxiety effect,
和提升情绪的作用  
and mood-elevating effect,
这些是独立进行的研究
those are from research studies done independently,
还有白桦茸
as well, it has Chaga mushroom,
白桦茸已被证明可以增加生长因子
Chaga mushroom has been shown to increase growth factors
会影响神经系统  例如神经生长因子  
that impact the nervous system, like nerve growth factor,
那就是我喝的原因
so that's the reason I drink it,
这就是我们在实验室中存放它的原因  
and that's the reason we stock it in the lab,
这就是我在家喝的原因
and that's the reason why I drink it at home.

对我来说  我真的很喜欢听Blinkist的书  
For me, I really like listening to books on Blinkist,
甚至我已经读过的书
even books that I've already read.
通常  我消费信息的方式
Typically, the way I consume information
是的  除非是小说  否则我会听一本非小说类的书
is, unless it's fiction, I'll listen to a nonfiction book
否则我将阅读实际的物理印刷版
or I'll read the actual, physical hard copy
一本非小说类书籍
of a nonfiction book,
最后  我想记笔记
and then at the end, I like to take some notes
关于真正困扰我的事情
about things that really stuck with me
或我想教的重点
or key takeaways that I'd like to teach
或与其他人分享
or share with other people.
使用Blinkist  它可以让我回到那些书上
With Blinkist, it allows me to go back to those books

在听或读的过程中
in the course of listening to or reading
完整版  
the full-length version,
如果我以前没看过书  
and if I haven't read a book before,
这也使我对是否
it also gives me a sense of whether or not
我想读书
I'd like to read the book.
Blinkist有一些很棒的科学类书籍  
Blinkist has some terrific science category books,
例如  我的同事和朋友大卫·伊格曼（David Eagleman）的书  
for example, my colleague and friend David Eagleman's book,
最近发布的“ Livewired”
"Livewired," which came out recently,
都是关于神经可塑性的
is all about neuroplasticity,
这是一本很棒的书  我读了全书  
it's a fantastic book, I read the full-length book,
我在Blinkist上听过
and I've listened to it on Blinkist,
这是“ Livewired”的绝佳提要
and it's a terrific synopsis of "Livewired,"
在那里
that's in there.
大卫·辛克莱（David Sinclair）的书《寿命》
David Sinclair's book, "Lifespan,"
你们中的许多人可能都知道大卫·辛克莱（David Sinclair）  
many of you probably know that David Sinclair,
哈佛医学院遗传学教授  
professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School,
是衰老和长寿领域的真正先驱  
is a real pioneer in the aging and longevity field,
他的著作《寿命》很棒  
his book "Lifespan" is terrific,
我读了完整的书  听了  
I've read the full-length book, I've listened to it,
我在Blinkist上听过
and I've listened to it on Blinkist,
因此  它确实包含了许多基本要素
and so it really captures a lot of the essential elements
你想从那本书中得到的
that you would want to get from that book.
Blinkist也是一种好方法
Blinkist is also just a great way

Theragun也为我们带来了今天的一集
Today's episode is also brought to us by Theragun.
Theragun是一种手持式冲击治疗仪
Theragun is a handheld percussive therapy device
释放深层肌肉张力
that releases deep muscle tension.
我了解到Theragun
I was introduced to Theragun
是几年前参加我的实验室的一次潜水探险
on a dive expedition for my laboratory a few years ago.
在那次探险中  我们运动强度很大
On that expedition, we were working very hard,
我们整天都在潜水  
we were diving all day,
我们用设备携带鹈鹕箱子  
we were carrying pelican cases with equipment,
我们带着氧气瓶
we were carrying tanks,
到最后很酸痛  很累  
very sore, very tired by the end of the day,
和其他人一样
as was everybody else.
有人带来了一把Theragun
Someone brought along a Theragun,
很快  Theragun在船上传来传去
and pretty soon, that thing was getting passed around
并成为船上最令人垂涎​​的设备
and became the most coveted device on board
因为它确实可以缓解
because it really works to relieve
酸痛和深层肌肉紧张
the soreness and deep muscle tension
通过体力劳动  运动来积累  
that accumulates with physical work, exercise,
甚至整天坐得太久  
even just sitting too long throughout the day,
所以当我回来时  我得到了一个Theragun  
so when I got back, I got a Theragun,
我仍然每天使用Theragun  
I still use the Theragun daily,
非常好  因为它很安静
it's terrific because it's very quiet
这样你就可以在看电影时使用它
so you can use it while watching a movie
甚至在谈话时
or even while having a conversation
没有它的侵扰性
without it feeling intrusive,
如果需要的话  它真的会渗入肌肉中
it really gets down into the meat of the muscle if you want,
或者  你也可以根据需要更浅层次地使用它
or you can use it more superficially if you like.
如果你想尝试Theragun  
If you want to try Theragun,
你可以访问theragun.com/huberman  
you can go to theragun.com/huberman,
他们有几种型号  
they have several models available,
第一个起价为190美元  如果你考虑一下的话  
the first one starts at $190, which if you think about it,
相当于专业按摩的价格
is comparable to the price of a professional massage
除了不像专业按摩  
except that unlike a professional massage,
你可以根据需要长时间使用Theragun
you can use the Theragun for as long as you want
全天候  只要你愿意  
throughout the day and for as many days as you like,
那是theragun.com/huberman  
that's theragun.com/huberman,
我应该提到
and I should mention that there's
还有30天的退款保证  
also a 30-day money-back guarantee,
因此  如果你不喜欢该产品  可以将其寄回  
so if you don't like the product, you send it back,
你拿回你的钱
you get your money back.
本月的“Huberman实验室播客”
This month on the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"
我们都在谈论激素
we're talking all about hormones,
这些令人难以置信的化学物质会影响我们的情绪  
these incredible chemicals that can impact our mood,
我们的行为  乐观或悲观的感觉
our behavior, our feelings of optimism or pessimism.
关于荷尔蒙的神奇之处
The amazing thing about hormones
是激素影响所有这些东西  
is that hormones impact all those things,
但是所有这些事情  
but all those things,
我们的感受  我们所做的事情和我们的想法
how we feel and what we do and what we think
也可以影响我们的荷尔蒙
also can impact our hormones,
所以这是一个非常有趣的生物学领域
and so it's a really fascinating area of biology
每天影响着我们每个人
that impacts every single one of us every day
在清醒和睡眠中
both in wakefulness and in sleep
以及整个生命周期
and throughout the lifespan.
今天  我们将谈论激素优化  
Today, we're going to be talking about hormone optimization,
我们将主要集中精力
and we're mainly going to be focusing
在雌激素和睾丸激素及其衍生物
on estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives.
“ Huberman Lab Podcast”的上一集  
Last episode of the
"Huberman Lab Podcast,"
我们谈到性发育
we talked about sexual development,
也就是说  染色体  性腺和荷尔蒙如何
that is, how the chromosomes, the gonads, and hormones
影响我们所谓的性发育  
impact what we call sexual development,
一直到青春期
leading all the way up to puberty.
今天  我们主要讨论
Today, we're mainly going to talk about processes
从青春期开始之后的过程
that happen from puberty onward,
虽然我们可能会谈
although we might talk
一点点的发育方面的东西  
a little bit about development as well,
所以今天  我们将谈论很多有关基础生物学的知识  
so today, we're going to talk a lot about basic biology,
但是我们将编织很多实用的工具
but we're going to weave in a lot of practical tools
如何优化
along the way for how to optimize
这些我们称为荷尔蒙的功能强大的东西
these incredibly powerful things that we call hormones.
在我们深入讨论之前
Before we dive into our discussion
关于激素优化  
about hormone optimization,
我想提出我认为非常重要的一点
I want to raise what I think is a very important point
至少直到最近我才听说
that at least I hadn't heard of until recently,
这就是称为“有益原则”的概念
which is the concept of salutogenesis.
我们中的许多人都熟悉"致病机制"的概念  
Many of us are familiar with the concept of pathogenesis,
所有这些可怕疾病的想法
the idea that there are all these scary diseases
像痴呆症  心脏病和中风  
like dementia and heart disease and stroke,
和所有这些等待着我们的东西
and all these things that await us
如果我们没有好好照顾自己
if we don't take good care of ourselves
即使我们这样做  也可能会等着我们  
and that might await us even if we do,
那就是“致病机制”  
that's the pathogenic model,
salutogenesis是我学到的东西
salutogenesis is something I learned about
来自我斯坦福大学的一位同事  
from one of my Stanford Medicine colleagues,
这是一个不同的方向
which is a different orientation
追求健康
toward health and well-being
在发生特定行为的地方  
where you're taking on particular behaviors,
你采取一种特殊的立场
you're taking on a particular stance
营养和运动  补充等
towards nutrition and exercise, supplementation, et cetera,
为了相比于没有采取这些行为
in order to promote well-being above where you would be
让你有更高的健康水平
if you were not doing those behaviors.
那么  如果你考虑一下  这两件事  
Now, if you think about it, these two things,
“有益原则”和“致病机制”
salutogenesis and the pathogenic model,
实际上是同一枚硬币的两个面  
are really two sides of the same coin,
我举一个例子
but I'll just give an example
说明这可能会如何对你产生实际影响
of how this might affect you in a real way.
如果你因为感觉很好而喜欢运动  
If you like exercise because it feels good, great,
但是很多人为此运动或吃得很好  
but many people exercise, or eat well, for that matter,
为了避免心脏病或痴呆  
in order to avoid heart disease or to avoid dementia,
为了避免身体成分发生负面变化  
to avoid negative changes in body composition,
虽然功能强大
and while that's powerful
锻炼肯定有这种作用
and certainly is the case that exercise
将帮助你摆脱所有这些事情  
will help you move away from all those things,
“有益原则”不同
the salutogenesis model differs
因为它涉及一种心态和方向
in that it involves a mindset and an orientation
为了感觉良好而做这些事情  
towards doing those things in order to feels good,
为了提高你的能量水平  
in order to enhance your level of energy,
为了改善内分泌功能
in order to improve endocrine function
和代谢功能
and metabolic function,
所以它确实是“致病机制”的一部分  
so it's really part of the pathogenic model,
然而  “有益原则”确实更多是一种心态
and yet, salutogenesis is really more of a mindset
为什么你会做这些特殊的行为  
toward why you would do these particular behaviors,
实际上  最强大的思维定势
and really, the most powerful mindset
将成为你正在思考的地方
is going to be one where you are thinking
关于“致病机制”  
about the pathogenic model,
做一些事情以免生病  等等
doing things so that you don't end up sick, et cetera,
为了摆脱疾病
and to move away from sickness,
以及“有益原则”模型  你做这些事情
as well as the salutogenic model where you're doing things
是为了走向健康和福祉
in order to move towards health and well-being.
我们今天想到的是健康与保健  
We think of health and wellness nowadays,
或健康社区  或健康习惯  
or the wellness community or wellness practices,
在很多方面  
and in many ways,
这就是“致病机制”的本质  
that is the essence of the salutogenic model,
但我发现这很有趣
but I found it very interesting
在同种疗法医学领域  
to know that within the field of allopathic medicine,
这两个模型存在
these two models exist
但是我们却没有经常听说过“有益原则”模型
but we don't hear about the salutogenic model quite as often,
所以这只是要记住的事情  
so it's just something to keep in mind,
特别是由于一些心态影响
especially because of some of the mindset effects
在前几集中讨论过  
that were discussed in previous episodes,
我现在不打算再次详细介绍这些内容  
I'm not going to go into these in detail again right now,
但是  如果你可能回想起有关饮食和情绪的一集  
but if you might recall from the episode on food and mood,
我们谈到了其中一些不可思议的研究
we talked about some of these incredible studies
这是由斯坦福大学Alia Crum小组和其他人完成的
that were done by Alia Crum's group at Stanford and others
表示如果你告诉别人
showing that if you tell people
他们将要做的行为  
that the behavior that they're about to do,
在这种情况下  是人们打扫酒店房间
in this case, it was people cleaning up hotel rooms
因为那是他们的工作  
because that was their job,
如果你告诉他们这对他们有好处  
if you tell them that it's good for them,
那么你会看到更大的积极健康影响
then you see much greater positive health effects
而不是如果他们不知道该信息
than if they aren't aware of that information
对他们有好处  
that it's good for them,
所以我们真的应该在想
so we should really be thinking
不仅要远离疾病和负面事物  
about not just moving away from disease and negative things,
还有为什么某些事情对我们有好处
but also why certain things are good for us
因为现在研究已经很成熟了
because it's well-established now
来自非常好的科学研究
from really good scientific studies
牢记事物的积极影响
that keeping in mind the positive effects of things
确实会对健康产生巨大影响  
can really have an outsized effect on well-being,
直击我们的生理水平
right down to the level of our physiology.
因此  让我们谈谈激素优化  
So let's talk about hormone optimization,
今天我们要谈论激素优化
today we're going to talk about hormone optimization
关于雌激素和睾丸激素
in reference to estrogen and testosterone
及其衍生物
and their derivatives,
那么  雌激素和睾丸激素及其衍生物
now, estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives
我们称之为性类固醇
are what we call sex steroids,
那么  性类固醇立即会让大家想起“性”  
now, the sex steroids immediately call to mind sex,
出于明显的原因  
for obvious reasons,
和类固醇  即合成代谢类固醇  
and steroids, meaning anabolic steroids,
但我只想强调一下雌激素和睾丸激素
but I just want to emphasize that estrogen and testosterone
存在于每个人中
are present in everybody,
是它们的比率决定了它们的影响  
it's their ratios that determine their effects,
所以今天我们要谈
and so today we're going to talk
关于如何优化它们的比率
about how you can optimize their ratios
取决于你的特定生活目标
depending on your particular life goals
因为雌激素和睾丸激素的比例
because the ratio of estrogen and testosterone
在每个人中都有深远的影响
in every individual has profound influence
对幸福的感觉  乐观的感觉  
on feelings of well-being, feelings of optimism,
生殖方面的焦虑感或缺乏焦虑感  
feelings of anxiety or lack of anxiety, on reproduction,
关于独立于生殖的性行为  
on sexual behavior independent of reproduction,
它们是非常强大的分子  
they are profoundly powerful molecules,
我们都会在某种程度上制造这些分子  
and we all make these molecules, to some degree or another,
但也有重要的行为工具  
but there are also important behavioral tools,
补充工具  
supplementation tools,
以及处方药
as well as prescription drugs
会影响睾丸激素和雌激素的比例
that can impact the ratios of testosterone and estrogen
以非常有力的方式
in really powerful ways,
所以我们将涵盖所有这些
so we're going to cover all of that.
我想强调的是  当你听到
I want to emphasize that when you hear
性类固醇或类固醇激素  
sex steroids or steroid hormones,
大多数人都考虑合成代谢类固醇  
most people think about anabolic steroids,
当然是合成代谢类固醇
and of course, anabolic steroids
是睾丸激素或睾丸激素本身的衍生物  
are derivatives of testosterone or testosterone itself,
并且它们在体育界被大量使用和滥用
and they are heavily used and abused in the sports community
以及在体育界之外  
as well as outside the sports community,
但是那里当然有很多类固醇
but there, of course, are many steroids
不是合成代谢类固醇
that are not anabolic steroids
在体育运动中也被滥用
that are also abused in sports.
今天  我们不是在谈论运动中的毒品  
Today, we're not talking about drugs in sports,
但我认为它的重量如此之重
but I think that it carries such a heavy weight
当人们听到类固醇这个词时  
when people hear the word steroids,
他们考虑合成代谢类固醇  
they think about anabolic steroids,
所以在今天的讨论中
so while today's discussion
肯定与身体表现有关  
will certainly be relevant to physical performance,
实际上  我们将要谈论
in fact, we're going to talk
关于特定类型的运动  
about how specific types of exercise,
特殊的冷暴露方式  
particular patterns of cold exposure,
以及某些模式  信不信由你  
as well as particular patterns, believe it or not,
呼吸会影响性类固醇激素  
of breathing can impact sex steroid hormones,
雌激素和睾丸激素  
both estrogen and testosterone,
讨论并没有真正针对
the discussion isn't really geared
致力于提高运动成绩  
towards performance enhancement in sport,
尽管我们将制作一整集  
although we will do an entire episode,
甚至整整一个月
perhaps even an entire month
与实际运动表现提升有关
related to performance enhancement in physical enterprises.
所以首先要了解的一件事
So one of the first things to understand
如果你想优化荷尔蒙
if you want to optimize your hormones
首先得知道  它们来自哪里
is where they come from.
体内有很多不同的腺体
There are a lot of different glands in the body
会产生激素
that produce hormones,
有松果体  
there's the pineal gland,
下丘脑产生一些激素  
some hormones are made in the hypothalamus,
激素是由性腺  卵巢或睾丸产生的  
hormones are made by the gonads, the ovaries or the testes,
你有甲状腺
you've got the thyroid gland,
有很多不同的腺体
there are a bunch of different glands
产生这些不同的激素  
that make these different hormones,
但是当我们谈论性类固醇激素时  
but when we're talking about the sex steroid hormones,
雌激素和睾丸激素  
estrogen and testosterone,
主要来源是雌激素的卵巢
the major sources are ovaries for estrogen
还有睾丸的睾丸激素
and the testes for testosterone,
尽管肾上腺也可以制造睾丸激素
although the adrenals can also make testosterone.
那么  还有一些酶  
Now, there are also some enzymes,
酶是可以改变化学成分的东西  
enzymes are things that can change chemical composition,
还有我们今天要谈论的酶
and the enzymes that we're going to talk about today
主要是芳香酶
are the aromatases mainly,
芳香酶将睾丸激素转化为雌激素  
the aromatases convert testosterone into estrogen,
举例来说  如果男性的睾丸激素水平很高  
so in a male, for instance, that has very high testosterone,
其中一些将是
some of that is going to be
被芳香酶转化为雌激素  
converted into estrogen by aromatase,
芳香酶是由体内脂肪制成的
and aromatase is made by body fat,
它也是在睾丸本身中制成的
it's also made in the testes themselves,
很多人没有意识到这一点  
a lot of people don't realize this,
但睾丸实际上有能力
but the testes actually have the capacity
生产低水平的雌激素和芳香化酶  
to manufacture estrogen and aromatase, albeit at low levels,
但这很重要
but this turns out to be important
为了在以后的时间优化男性的激素水平  
for optimizing hormone levels in males at later points,
我们将讨论这一点
and we'll discuss that.
重要的是要注意  
It's important to note that there's a huge range
就荷尔蒙水平而言  
in terms of the levels of hormones,
个体之间的睾丸激素和雌激素  差异很大
testosterone and estrogen, between individuals,
它实际上发生在个人内
and it actually occurs within individuals
在整个生命周期中
across the lifespan,
我不会丢一些具体数字给你们
I'm not going to throw out specific numbers
什么每分升X皮克的数量  按天等
of X picograms per deciliter, et cetera today
因为这会有很大的不同  
because that's going to vary a lot,
这将取决于你是否在测量
it's going to depend on whether or not you're measuring
用皮克或毫微克之类的东西
in picograms or nanograms and that sort of thing,
如果你想检查你的荷尔蒙  
if you want to examine your hormones,
你应该和医生一起做
you should do that in conjunction with a medical doctor,
最好是内分泌学家  他们可以为你提供帮助
ideally, an endocrinologist can help you
整理这些信息  
sort out that information,
但重要的是要知道
but the important thing to know
青春期前的女性很少产生雌激素  
is that prepubescent females make very little estrogen,
当我们谈论雌激素时
and when we talk about estrogen,
我们主要谈论雌二醇  
we mainly talk about estradiol,
这是雌激素最活跃的形式
which is the most active form of estrogen
在男性和女性中
in both males and females.
所以青春期前的女性  雌激素水平很低  
So prepubescent females, very low levels of estrogen,
在青春期  雌激素水平
during puberty, levels of estrogen,
又叫雌二醇  基本上是飞涨的
AKA estradiol, basically skyrocket,
然后在整个寿命过程中  雌激素都会发生变化
and then across the lifespan, estrogen is going to vary
根据月经周期的阶段  
depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle,
但随着人进入更年期  
but as one heads into menopause,
现在通常会发生
which typically takes place nowadays
在45至60岁之间
somewhere between age 45 and 60,
雌激素水平将下降
levels of estrogen are going to drop
然后绝经后雌激素水平很低
and then post-menopause levels of estrogen are very low.
同样  睾丸激素会在整个生命周期中波动  
As well, testosterone will fluctuate across the lifespan,
男性的睾丸激素青春期相对较低  
testosterone is going to be relatively low prepuberty in males,
在青春期  它会飞涨  
during puberty, it's going to skyrocket,
然后是当前数字
and then the current numbers
它以每年约1％的速度下降  
are that it drops off at about a rate of 1% per year,
尽管我们将要讨论一些数据
although we're going to talk about some data
表明实际上存在着巨大的差异
that show that there's actually tremendous variation
在睾丸激素水平上  
in testosterone levels,
实际上有很多例子
there's actually a lot of examples
90多岁  90多岁的男性
of men in their 90s, their 90s,
仍然有睾丸激素水平
who still have testosterone levels
几乎是青春期的水平  
that mimic pubertal levels,
这很了不起  说明了
which is remarkable and speaks to the huge variation
个体之间的睾丸激素水平巨大差异
in testosterone levels across individuals.
因此  让我们谈谈这些激素的其他来源  
So let's talk about other sources of these hormones,
然后它会弄清楚
and then it will make clear
你可能想采取什么途径
what avenues you might want to take
为了优化这些激素
in order to optimize these hormones.
体内其他腺体和组织
The other glands and tissues in the body
会产生这些激素  睾丸激素和雌激素  
that make these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,
正如我简短提到的  是肾上腺  
as I mentioned briefly, are the adrenals,
所以肾上腺就在肾脏的顶部  
so the adrenals right on top of the kidneys,
并从肾上腺释放这些类固醇激素  
and the release of these steroid hormones from the adrenals,
特别是睾丸激素
in particular testosterone
及其一些相关的衍生品  
and some of its related derivatives,
主要是由竞争激活的  
are mainly activated by competition,
所以我们来谈谈竞争
so let's talk about competition
因为事实证明竞争
because it turns out that competition
对性类固醇激素有强大的影响  
is a powerful influence on the sex steroid hormones,
和性类固醇激素
and the sex steroid hormones
有力地影响竞争
powerfully influence competition.
所以大多数人没有意识到这一点  
So most people don't realize this,
但特定哺乳动物种类的大多数雄性
but most males of a given mammalian species
永远不会繁殖
never get to reproduce,
事实上  他们甚至根本没有发生过性关系  
in fact, they never even get to have sex at all,
而且我们并不经常考虑这一点  
and we don't often think about that,
但是睾丸激素在某个物种中
but testosterone plays a powerful role
可以决定哪个成员能够去繁殖
in determining which members of a given species
睾丸激素是很重要的角色 
will get to reproduce,
去决定那个物种中的一个成员
which ones of that species
可以去实际接触到雌性 
will actually get access to females,
所以在这里我不是在专门谈论人类  
and so here I'm not talking about humans specifically,
但是它在象海豹这样的物种
but it's well known in species like elephant seals,
还有什么 鹿角动物和公羊的物种中广为人知  
in species like antlered animals and rams, for instance,
睾丸激素水平的高低
that the higher levels of testosterone
与获得雌性青睐相关
correlate with access to females.
那么  对此的一种解释是  雌性
Now, one interpretation of this is that the females
可以检测哪些雄性的睾丸激素水平较高
are detecting which males have high testosterone
然后选择它们
and selecting them,
她们更容易接受这些雄性
they're more receptive to them,
我们将在稍后讨论交配的接受度  
we're going to talk about receptivity for mating in a moment,
但实际上更多的是
but it's actually more so that the males
睾丸激素更高的雄性
that have higher testosterone forage further
会为雌性而战  
and will fight harder for the females,
这真的很有趣
and this is really interesting
因为现在有很好的证据
because there's very good evidence now
睾丸激素可以减轻焦虑  
that testosterone can reduce anxiety,
促进寻求新颖性  
promote novelty-seeking,
并促进竞争互动  
and promote competitive interactions,
因此  在你脑海中处理这一点信息之前  
and so before you leap too far with this in your mind
想一想所有这些人类行为  先跟我的思路
and think about all these human behaviors, just stay with me
因为这里有些生物学
because there's a little bit of biology here
可以让这一切都说得通
that makes it all make sense
事实证明这很简单
and it turns out to be pretty simple.
我们有一个叫做杏仁核的大脑区域  
We have a brain region called the amygdala,
在拉丁文中  这意味着杏仁
in Latin, that just means almond,
但杏仁核以其在恐惧中的作用而闻名  
but the amygdala is most famous for its role in fear,
我们听到很多关于恐惧和杏仁核的信息  
we hear a lot about fear and the amygdala,
但是杏仁核
but that the amygdala
确实参与了威胁检测  
is really involved in threat detection,
它设定了我们的焦虑门槛
it sets our thresholds for anxiety
还有我们认为可怕或太多的东西
and what we consider scary or too much,
性腺分泌的睾丸激素
testosterone secreted from the gonads
身体其他地方与杏仁核结合
and elsewhere in the body binds to the amygdala
并更改压力阈值  
and changes the threshold for stress,
所以我之前在这个播客的先前版本中说过
so I've said before on previous versions of this podcast
和其他播客
and on other podcasts
睾丸激素有这种不可思议的作用
that testosterone has this incredible effect
使努力感觉良好  
of making effort feel good,
但我真正指的是事实
but what I was really referring to is the fact
睾丸激素可以减轻压力和焦虑  
that testosterone lowers stress and anxiety,
特别是在给定物种的雄性中
in particular, in males in a given species.
那么  这很重要
Now, this is important
因为我们经常认为睾丸激素可以创造  
because we often think of testosterone as creating,
男性化
whatever, masculinization
或你知道的是病毒化  
or it's, you know, virilization,
或所有这些术语都被用烂了  
or all these terms are thrown around,
但是在伴侣的选择和竞争时
but what's it really doing
它到底在做什么？
when it comes to mate choice and competition?
它正在做的是降低焦虑的门槛  
What it's doing is it's reducing the threshold for anxiety,
并以此来选择个人
and in doing so, it selects individuals
给定物种的进一步发展  
of a given species to push further,
愿意承受更多的痛苦  
being willing to suffer more,
尽管它也减轻了痛苦  
although it also reduces pain,
所以也许他们受的痛苦也更少  
so maybe they also suffer less,
追求生殖和女性
in pursuit of reproduction and females.
那么  在人类中众所周知  男性和女性
Now, it's well known in humans that both males and females
睾丸激素水平升高的人
who have elevated levels of testosterone
将寻求更多新颖性  
will engage in more novelty-seeking,
我想指出
and I do want to point out
即使没有睾丸的人也有睾丸激素  
that even individuals without testes have testosterone,
睾丸激素的峰具有相似的作用
and peaks in testosterone have similar effects
不管有人是否有卵巢或睾丸  
regardless of whether or not someone has ovaries or testes,
睾丸激素的增加通常会导致更多的觅食  
testosterone increases generally lead to more foraging,
追求更多新颖性  性欲增加  
more novelty-seeking, increases in libido,
并增加了交配的欲望  
and increases in desire to mate,
所以这种情况会增加睾丸激素
so it is the case that increases in testosterone
促进竞争和觅食型行为
promote competitive and foraging-type behaviors
在人类和非人类哺乳动物中  
in humans and in nonhuman mammals,
但是竞争本身也确实是
but it's also true that competition itself
可以增加雄激素  例如睾丸激素  
can increase androgens, such as testosterone,
我想重复一遍  竞争环境本身
I want to repeat that, competitive environments themselves
可以增加睾丸激素
can increase testosterone.
那么  有人得出了结论
Now, some people have come to the conclusion
如果你获胜  你的睾丸激素会上升  
that if you win, your testosterone goes up,
如果输了  睾丸激素就会下降
and if you lose, your testosterone goes down,
在某种程度上  这是真的  
and to some extent, that's true,
但这不是对性腺的直接影响  
but that's not a direct effect on the gonads,
实际上是由神经调节剂多巴胺介导的
that's actually mediated by the neuromodulator dopamine,
我们谈到了多巴胺
we talked about dopamine
在关于动力和动力的那一集中  
in the episode on motivation and drive,
多巴胺和睾丸激素
and dopamine and testosterone
在身体上有明显的相互作用  
have a remarkable interplay in the body,
多巴胺实际上在大脑中释放
dopamine is actually released in the brain
以垂体的方式
in ways that has the pituitary,
坐落在你嘴巴上方的腺体  
this gland that sits over the roof of your mouth,
释放某些激素
release certain hormones
然后继续促进更多睾丸激素的释放  
that then go on to promote the release of more testosterone,
实际上  获胜会促进更多的多巴胺  
and indeed, winning promotes more dopamine,
后来  更多的睾丸激素  
and later, more testosterone,
但是  从短期来看  
however, in the short term,
只是竞争增加了睾丸激素
just competing increases testosterone
不论你是赢还是输  
independent of whether or not you win or lose,
所以这个的短版
so the short version of this
是竞争增加了睾丸激素  
is that competition increases testosterone,
这可能是一种古老的机制  雄激素
and this may be an ancient mechanism whereby the androgens,
如睾丸激素  正在反馈
such as testosterone, are feeding back
鼓励更具竞争性的行为
to encourage more competitive-type behaviors
因为每个物种
because every species,
你是否在谈论生殖
whether or not you're talking about reproduction
或其他资源分配  
or other resource allocation,
都会涉及到竞争  
is involved in competition,
不是每个物种的每个人
not every individual of a species
可以追求到相同数量的伴侣
gets access to the same number of mates
或同等质量的同伴  
or the same quality of mates,
这在两个方向上都是正确的  
and this is true in both directions,
适用于男性和女性以及介于两者之间的所有内容
for males and females and everything in between.
所以我只想再次强调
So I just want to emphasize once more
万一我过得太快
in case I went through it too quickly
女性睾丸激素增加
that increases in testosterone in females
也将导致生殖行为的增加
are also going to lead to increase in reproductive behavior
或寻求生殖行为  她们会增加性欲  
or seeking out reproductive behavior, they increase libido,
实际上  月经周期有一个特定阶段
in fact, there's a particular phase of the menstrual cycle
排卵前睾丸激素达到峰值的地方
where testosterone peaks just before ovulation
平均而言  这会导致女性人类寻找性行为
that, on average, leads female humans to seek out sex
比她们在周期中要多得多
more than they would otherwise during their cycle,
这都是自我报告  
and this is all by self-report,
但这也是在测量
but this is also while measuring
诸如睾丸激素-雌激素比例之类的东西  
things like testosterone-estrogen ratios, and so forth,
所以真的很有趣 这么一个分子
so it's really interesting that a single molecule,
不管染色体和性腺的背景是什么  
regardless of chromosomal or gonadal background,
导致了越来越多地寻求伴侣的行为  在个体之间
is increasing seeking of mates across individuals,
越来越多的竞争欲望或竞争意愿  
increasing desire to compete or willingness to compete,
并降低压力和焦虑的阈值
and lowering the threshold for stress and anxiety.
重要的是要指出
It's important to point out
在睾丸激素增加的同时
that while increases in testosterone
促进寻找伴侣和繁殖
promote seeking of mates and reproduction
在男性和女性中都是如此
in both males and females,
在女性中  雌激素实际上增加了
in females, it's actually increases in estrogen
促进交配的能力  
that promote receptivity to mating,
所以睾丸激素推动了性的追求
so testosterone is driving the seeking of sex
雌激素正在促进
and estrogen is promoting
女性的实际性行为  
the actual act of sex from females,
所谓的接受性  自愿接受性
so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity.
在男性中  指出睾丸激素很有趣
In males, it's interesting to point out that testosterone
正在促进寻求性行为  
is promoting seeking of sex,
但是雄性中的雌激素对性欲也很重要  
but it's also estrogen in males that's important for libido,
如果雌激素水平太低  
if estrogen levels are brought too low,
那么男人将完全失去性欲  
then men will completely lose their libido,
这通常不会被讨论或忽略
this is often not discussed or overlooked
在有关睾丸激素治疗的讨论中
in the discussion about testosterone therapy
和增强性能的药物  
and performance-enhancing drugs,
人们认为雄激素过多的个体  
people think that hyperandrogenized individuals,
表示雄激素水平很高的人
meaning people that have very high levels of androgen
他们的性欲水平很高  他们会  
will have very high levels of libido, and they will,
提供雌激素
provided estrogen is available
以足够的比例匹配睾丸激素  
in sufficient ratios to match that testosterone,
所以这不是简单的关系
so it's not simply the case
什么高水平的睾丸激素
that high levels of testosterone
就产生很多性行为和交配行为
produce a lot of sex and mating behavior
雌激素水平低也没问题  
and low levels of estrogen are good across the board,
不是的实际上  男性和女性都需要
you actually need both in both males and females,
只是女性的睾丸激素水平
it's just that in females, the testosterone levels
总是低于雌激素水平  
are always going to be lower than the estrogen levels,
在男性中  雌激素水平
and in males, the estrogen levels
总是会低于睾丸激素水平  
are always going to be lower than testosterone levels,
所以睾丸激素促进性行为  
so testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior,
然后真正的问题是  
and the real question then is,
性本身会促进睾丸激素吗？
does sex itself promote testosterone?
答案有些复杂  
And the answer is somewhat complicated,
简单来说  是的
but the short version is yes,
你应该知道  性爱有多个阶段  
and as you recall, sex has multiple stages,
所以有性行为
so there's the physical act of sex,
有性的追求  
there's the seeking of sex,
然后有高潮和射精
and then there's orgasm and ejaculation.
那么  重要的是要区分这些
Now, it's important to distinguish between these
因为  性本身是否能增加睾丸激素
because whether or not sex itself increases testosterone
取决于男性是否射精  
depends on whether or not the male ejaculates,
这对理解非常重要
and this is very important to understand
因为在上一集中
because on a previous episode,
我提到多巴胺如何随着性活动而增加  
I mentioned how dopamine increases with sexual activity,
记住  多巴胺和睾丸激素
remember, dopamine and testosterone
往往彼此线性增加  
tend to increase linearly with one another,
但是射精后会释放催乳素  
but then after ejaculation, there's a release of prolactin,
催乳素实际上设定了男性的不应期
and prolactin actually sets the refractory period in males
在此期间  他不能再发生性行为  
during which he can't have sex again,
不应期的持续时间
and the duration of the refractory period
取决于时间长短  差异很大
will vary tremendously depending on how much and how long
发生催乳素释放
that prolactin release occurs.
我在上一集中也有描述
I also described in a previous episode
有些人如何服用维生素B6  
how some people take vitamin B6,
我不建议任何人这样做  
I'm not suggesting anyone do this,
但服用维生素B6以降低催乳素水平
but take vitamin B6 in order to reduce prolactin levels
从而减少了不应期的持续时间  
and thereby reduce the duration of the refractory period,
但是这个问题
but getting at this question
就是睾丸激素和性行为  
about testosterone and sexual behavior,
重要的是要区分
it's important to distinguish
在这些不同的繁殖阶段之间
between these different phases of reproduction
或生殖行为  
or reproductive behaviors,
因此有研究表明性行为本身
so there are studies showing that sexual behavior itself
可以增加睾丸激素  
can increase testosterone,
2011年发表了一项研究
there was a study published in 2011
来自ESCASA等Escasa等人  
from Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A,
这是教科书上的东西  在PubMed上  
this is the stuff of textbooks, this is on PubMed,
这些是高质量研究  
these are quality studies,
表明那些观察性的男人  
showing that men who observe sex,
所以我想这是观察色情作品  
so I guess this would be observing pornography,
睾丸激素会稍微增加
will have slight increases in testosterone
在观察过程中  
during the observation,
这些人实际上愿意在看色情片时
these people actually were willing to have blood draws taken
被抽血
while watching pornography,
他们的睾丸激素增加非常温和  
they had increases in testosterone that were very modest,
大约10％
of about 10%,
而当人们参与性生活时
whereas when people participated in sex,
所以他们真的是找了人们抽血进行这项研究
so they actually did this study where people had blood draws
抽血的时候他们与伴侣发生了真正的性关系  
and they had real sex with their partners,
他们的睾丸激素增加了70％  
and they had 70% increases in testosterone,
所以睾丸激素在性行为过程中
so there are increases in testosterone
增加了
that are quite significant
非常多  剧烈增加
during the physical act of sex
而在观察性爱时则少得多
and far less so during observing sex.
那么  我经常遇到的问题是
Now, the question that I often get,
实际上  这是我最常遇到的问题之一
in fact, it's one of the questions I get most often
在YouTube上的评论中  
in the comments on YouTube,
我不知道为什么
I don't know why that is,
射精是否可以调节睾丸激素水平  
is whether or not ejaculation adjusts testosterone levels,
事实证明  我可以找到两项研究
and it turns out, there are two studies that I could find
在PubMed上进行的质量研究可以解决这个问题  
that were quality studies on PubMed that address this,
性和射精本身
that sex and ejaculation itself
不会降低睾丸激素水平
does not reduce testosterone levels
虽然会增加催乳素的水平
although it will increase prolactin levels
出于我刚才描述的原因  
for the reasons I described a moment ago,
但是  禁欲或没有射精的性行为
however, abstinence or sex without ejaculation
一个星期或更长时间
for a week or more
可使睾丸激素水平增加至400％  
will increase testosterone levels up to 400%,
所以答案实际上很复杂
so the answer is actually complicated,
这并不简单  
it's not straightforward,
这意味着性本身会增加睾丸激素  
what it means is that sex itself increases testosterone,
但是  节制也会增加睾丸激素
however, abstinence also increases testosterone
更多地增加  
even further,
所以这是一个很微妙的答案  
so it's a nuanced answer,
我希望这能满足你们的需要  没有双关语  
and I hope this is satisfactory, no pun intended,
对于那些一直问我的人  
to those of you that have been asking me,
性和射精之间有什么关系
what is the relationship between sex and ejaculation
还有睾丸激素和多巴胺之间什么关系？
and testosterone and dopamine?
是细微的差别  你必须了解细微差别
It is nuanced, and you have to understand that nuance
如果你想了解
if you want to understand
某些行为如何影响荷尔蒙
how certain behaviors impact hormones
以及激素如何影响这些行为
and how hormones impact those behaviors.
正如我之前提到的  在女性中  
As I mentioned before, in females,
睾丸激素也激发了寻找性行为的动机  
testosterone also primes the motivation to seek out sex,
性本身也会增加睾丸激素  
and sex itself also increases testosterone,
但它也会增加催乳素  
but it also increases prolactin,
所以无论是男人还是女人
so in both men and women,
性别会增加性激素催乳素  
sex increases prolactin post-sex,
这只是系统运作的方式  
it's just the way that the system works,
就是睾丸激素和多巴胺增加
it's that testosterone and dopamine increase
在寻找和性行为中  
in the seeking-out and the behavior of sex,
然后性交后  催乳素水平上升  
and then after sex, prolactin levels go up,
有点寂静  
there's kind of a quiescence,
整个神经系统都趋于平静  
the whole nervous system is promoted towards calm,
这实际上可能与两人间的连接感有关
and this may actually have something to do with pair-bonding
和互相的鼓励
and the encouragement of individuals
花更多的时间在一起
to spend more time together
交换不同的气味和荷尔蒙  
to exchange different smells and hormones,
甚至信息素  
and maybe even pheromones,
我们稍后将讨论信息素
and we're going to talk about pheromones in a moment.
几年前  刮起了一阵大风
A few years ago, there was a lot of excitement
关于激素DHEA  
about the hormone DHEA,
这主要是由肾上腺产生的
which is mainly made by the adrenals,
DHEA已被推广为一种万能药 
DHEA has been promoted as kind of a catch-all
用于增加睾丸激素和雌激素
for increasing testosterone and estrogen
在男性和女性中
in males and females,
确实  DHEA会增加
and indeed, DHEA will increase
睾丸激素和雌激素
both testosterone and estrogen,
这是要注意的事情
this is something to be mindful of
如果你正在考虑服用DHEA
if you're thinking about taking DHEA
或你已经服用DHEA
or you're taking DHEA already.
DHEA会同时增加睾丸激素和雌激素  
DHEA will increase both testosterone and estrogen,
以及它增加两种激素的程度
and the extent to which it increases one or the other
取决于你在开始时
will depend on whether or not you're starting off
是雌激素比睾丸激素更多
with more estrogen than testosterone
还是说
or whether or not you're starting off
睾丸激素比雌激素多
with more testosterone than estrogen
以及你是否有很多芳香化酶  
and whether or not you have a lot of aromatase,
因此  对于具有大量芳香化酶的个人
so for individuals that have a lot of aromatase
由睾丸或体内脂肪制成  
being made by the testes or by body fat,
如果你服用脱氢表雄酮  则很有机会
if you take DHEA, there's a good chance
那相当一部分
that a fair portion of that
将被运用于雌激素的生产
is going to be shuttled towards estrogen production
而不是去生产睾丸激素
and not towards testosterone production,
而在具有
whereas in individuals that have
首先是低水平的睾丸激素
low levels of testosterone to begin with,
高水平的雌激素
high levels of estrogen,
DHEA有很大的可能性
there's a good chance that the DHEA
将主要促进雌激素的产生  
is going to promote mainly estrogen production,
至少那是我所能找到的
at least that's what I could find
从我检查过的研究中
from the research studies that I examined.
因此  考虑脱氢表雄酮的方法  
So the way to think about DHEA,
它是性类固醇激素的一种全球促进剂  
it's a kind of global promoter of the sex steroid hormones,
其具体效果将取决于
and its specific effects are going to depend
关于你从哪里开始的一点
a little bit on where you started
以及你是否有卵巢或睾丸
and whether or not you have ovaries or testes.
所以就像有行为
So just as there are behaviors
可以增加睾丸激素  
that can increase testosterone,
有些行为会降低睾丸激素  
there are behaviors that can decrease testosterone,
而人类中最有特色的人物之一
and one of the most well-characterized ones in humans
就是正在成为父母的人  准父母
is becoming a parent.
因此  比如说准爸爸  
So expecting fathers have an almost 50% decrease
他们游离和结合的睾丸激素水平减少了近50％
in testosterone levels, both free and bound testosterone,
以及他们的皮质醇水平  压力荷尔蒙  
as well, their cortisol levels, a stress hormone,
下降了近三倍  这简直令人难以置信  
drop by almost three-fold, which is incredible,
他们的雌二醇水平增加了一倍  
and their estradiol levels double,
所以他们的雌激素水平增加了一倍
so their estrogen levels double,
所以准爸爸  很多人都知道
so expecting fathers many people have known
会涨额外的体重
put on additional body weight,
每个人都以为这是因为他们在吃东西
everyone always thought that it's because they're eating
与他们怀孕的妻子同时  
in parallel with their pregnant wife,
但事实证明  降低睾丸激素的这些作用  
but it turns out that these effects of reduced testosterone,
雌二醇增加  皮质醇减少
increased estradiol, and reduced cortisol
可以用催乳素增加来解释  
can all be explained by an increase in prolactin,
因此不仅在人类中  而且在其他物种中  
so not just in humans, but in other species as well,
当那个物种的雄性和雌性
when the male and female of that species
怀上了小宝贝之后 
are expecting young,
他们增加了更多的身体脂肪  
they lay down more body fat,
说是这是为了准备
the assumption is that this is to prepare
漫长的不眠之夜  
for long nights of no sleep,
它发生在许多物种中  而不仅仅是在人类中  
which occurs in many species, not just in humans,
因此  这种激素  催乳素  
so it's really interesting that this hormone, prolactin,
可以开始抑制所有种类的激素  
can start suppressing whole categories of hormones,
性类固醇激素  
sex steroid hormones,
并可以开始增加其他类别的整个类别  
and can start increasing whole categories of other ones,
所以我们听说过“爸爸肚”
so we hear about the dad bod,
爸爸肚有很多解释
there are a lot of explanations for the dad bod
这个超过了此播客节目的知识范围
that extend well beyond this podcast episode,
但这是一个众所周知的现象
but it is a well-known phenomenon
睾丸激素会下降  
that testosterone is going to drop,
催乳素会增加  
prolactin's going to increase,
雌二醇的激素含量将增加
estradiol's going to increase in males and females
同时在那些怀上孩子的父母两人身上
that are expecting children.
那么  持续多长时间非常有趣  
Now, how long that lasts is very interesting,
实际上与多少接触有关
it actually has to do with how much contact
以及有多少气味接触
and how much contact with smells
婴儿  后代
of the baby, of the offspring,
父亲接触到他们的气味
the father happens to have,
所以他有多有空陪孩子
so how available or unavailable he is
实际上会影响他的荷尔蒙水平  
will actually impact his level of hormones,
那么  我绝对不是这个意思  也不想推广这个想法
now, I'm definitely not promoting the idea
父亲或母亲要花时间远离他们的后代 
that fathers or mothers take time away from their offspring
来保持高睾丸激素水平 
in order to keep their testosterone levels high
或恢复他们的高睾丸激素水平  
or to restore them,
那根本不是我要说的
that's not what I'm saying at all,
我只想指出这个结论  这很有趣
it's just interesting to point out
这些进化机制将我们推向
that these evolutionary mechanisms push us toward
或使我们偏向特定类别的行为
or bias us toward particular categories of behaviors
通过影响我们的荷尔蒙  
by influencing our hormones,
然后反馈
which then feed back
并推广更多这种特殊行为
and promote more of that particular behavior
因为就像我之前提到的
because as I mentioned before,
男性和女性睾丸激素的峰值
peaks in testosterone in males and females
导致个人寻求性行为  而不是促进育儿  
cause individuals to seek sex, not promote parenting,
而减少睾丸激素  
whereas reductions in testosterone,
催乳素增加  皮质醇减少
increases in prolactin, and decreases in cortisol
使两性个体趋向育儿行为
move individuals of both sexes toward parenting behavior
少了生殖行为
and less toward reproductive behavior.
明显减少睾丸激素的其他行为
The other behavior that markedly reduces testosterone
男性和女性身上都是这样
in both males and females
不管是明显减少了追求性的欲望
and markedly reduces the desire
还是减少性行为  这都是疾病  
for seeking sex and sex itself is illness,
你们中许多人可能会说  
and many of you might say,
“嗯  当人们感到不适时  
"Well, duh, when people feel sick,
“他们不想寻找伴侣  
"they don't feel like seeking out mates,
“他们不想做爱  ”
"they don't feel like having sex,"
但是你是否想过为什么呢？
but have you ever wondered why that actually is?
好吧  事实证明它可以解释
Well, it turns out that it can be explained
通过释放所谓的炎性细胞因子  
by the release of what are called inflammatory cytokines,
所以细胞因子与免疫系统有关  
so cytokines are related to the immune system,
他们在淋巴和血液中传播  
they travel in the lymph and in the blood,
他们攻击细菌和病毒等入侵细胞  
and they attack invader cells like bacteria and viruses,
在生病的情况下
and under conditions of illness,
我们制造许多不同的细胞因子  
we make a lot of different cytokines,
其中一些是抗炎药  
some of them are anti-inflammatory,
但其中一些是促炎的  
but some of them are pro-inflammatory,
和最著名的例子
and the best-known example
炎性细胞因子中的一种是IL-6  
of a pro-inflammatory cytokine is IL-6,
众所周知  当IL-6注入个体时  
and it's known that IL-6, when injected into individuals,
会减少性欲
will decrease the desire for sex
最终会减少
and eventually will reduce
睾丸激素和雌激素的水平
levels of testosterone and estrogen
独立于糟糕的感觉  
independent of feeling lousy,
所以人们生病时不想做爱的原因
so the reason why people don't want sex when they're sick
是因为IL-6的水平增加了
is because levels of IL-6 are increased.
那么  这很重要
Now, this is important
因为当我们开始思考不同的
because as we start to think about the different ways
调节性类固醇激素的方式时
to modulate the sex steroid hormones,
所谓的“优化激素  ”
so-called optimize the hormones,
保持低水平的IL-6
keeping levels of IL-6 low
对他们发挥作用很重要  
is going to be important for them to exert their effects,
那么  IL-6不仅前往性腺
now, IL-6 doesn't just travel to the gonads
并关闭性腺  
and shut down the gonads,
它实际上具有与某些受体相互作用的方式
it actually has ways to interact with some of the receptors
类固醇激素  
that the steroid hormones,
雌激素和睾丸激素结合  
estrogen and testosterone, bind to,
并影响那些受体
and impact those receptors
这样性类固醇激素就不会起作用
so that the sex steroid hormones can't have their effect.
简而言之  
In short and put simply,
炎性细胞因子  如IL-6
inflammatory cytokines like IL-6
对性类固醇激素有害  
are bad for sex steroid hormones,
因此  我们将讨论如何调节IL-6
and so we're going to talk about how to modulate IL-6
朝着你想要的方向
in the direction that you would want
以及如何增加另一种称为IL-10的细胞因子  
and how to increase another cytokine called IL-10,
这是消炎的
which is anti-inflammatory
以有助于促进或至少支持的方式
in ways that can help promote, or at least support,
性类固醇激素
the sex steroid hormones.
因此  随着我们的前进  
So as we move forward,
我们现在要开始考虑
we're going to now start to consider
什么样的行为习惯  
what sorts of behavioral practices,
以及其他东西  
as well as other things,
可以调节性类固醇激素
can modulate the sex steroid hormones
按照你希望的方向增加或减少
in the directions that you want them to go,
但是在我们这样做之前  
but before we do that,
为了为此做好准备  
and in order to set the stage for that,
你应该问自己
you should be asking yourself,
在机制层面上  它如何或为什么
how is it, or why is it, at a mechanistic level,
行为可以去完全调节激素？
that behaviors can modulate hormones at all?
如果你仔细想一下  这有点奇怪
If you think about it, it's kind of strange
那仅仅是做父母或做父母的行为
that just the mere act of being a parent or parenting
可以极大地改变睾丸激素水平
can change testosterone levels so dramatically
或极大地改变雌二醇水平  这是为什么？
or estradiol levels so dramatically, what is it?
是婴儿的汗水吗？
Is it the sweat of the baby?
是他们的唾液吗？
Is it their saliva?
是婴儿的视线吗？
Is it the sight of the baby?
是抱着婴儿  还是所有这些东西？
Is it holding the baby, or is it all those things?
事实证明  其中许多影响
It turns out that many of those effects
是因为气味
are because of smell,
甚至在某些情况下甚至可能是信息素
or in some cases, even possibly pheromones.
那么  我谈论激素
Now, I talked about hormones,
激素又是一种化学物质  会在体内传播  
hormones, again, are a chemical, travels in the body,
影响身体其他部位的组织和细胞  
impacts tissues and cells elsewhere in the body,
信息素是一种被释放的化学物质
a pheromone is a chemical that's released
由一个物种的一个成员
by one member of a species
会影响其他地方的成员  
that goes and impacts members elsewhere,
但属于同一物种  甚至其他物种
but of the same species, or even of other species.
那么  信息素的作用已完全确立
Now, pheromone effects are absolutely well-established
在许多动物物种中
in lots of animal species,
但它们在人类中引起很大争议
but they are very controversial in humans.
今天我要谈
Today, I'm going to talk
这个理论已经完全成熟建立的一些物种  
about some of the well-established ones in animals,
我之前已经提到其中一两个
I've mentioned one or two of these before
在以前的播客中  
on previous podcasts,
但我没有提到其中的几个
but I haven't mentioned several of them,
我将谈论
and I'm going to talk about the evidence
用于已证明并建立在人类身上信息素的证据
for pheromones in humans that are well-established.
所以讨论的动物主要
So the main ones in animals that are discussed
被称为李布特效应  惠顿效应  
are called the Lee-Boot effect, the Whitten effect,
布鲁斯效应和范登堡效应  
the Bruce effect, and the Vandenbergh effect,
以发现他们的人的名字命名
named after the people that discovered them.
Lee-Boot效应是
The Lee-Boot effect is when
你安置了物种的雌性而没有雄性  
you house females of a given species together with no males,
它们开始显示更长的时间  即所谓的发情周期  
they start displaying longer, what are called estrus cycles,
在许多物种中  它们没有月经周期  
in many species, they don't have menstrual cycles,
也就是通常的28天  
which are 28 days,
他们的发情周期通常为四天
they have estrus cycles which tend to be four days
个体有差异
or some variant thereof.
这是一个有趣的现象  因为它意味着
It's an interesting phenomenon because what it means
男性本身的存在  单这一点
is that the presence of the male itself
就会改变排卵周期
is changing the ovulation cycle.
那么  外面有很多人  
Now, many people out there,
我想大多数人都在排卵
I imagine mostly the people that are ovulating out there
会说：“当然  我注意到我排卵的方式不同  
will say, "Of course, I notice I ovulate differently,
“或者当我在伴侣面前时我的周期发生变化
"or my cycle changes when I'm in the presence of my partner
“或者我不是  ”
"or I'm not,"
但是信息素的作用
but the pheromone effect
反映了人类的这种Lee-Boot效应
that mirrors this Lee-Boot effect in humans
尚未真正被确认  
has still not really been identified,
没有人知道确切的化学物质是什么  
nobody knows what the exact chemical is,
但是  尽管如此  这对某些动物还是有很强的作用
but nonetheless, this is a strong effect in some animals.
另一个是布鲁斯效应  
The other one is the Bruce effect,
这是非常戏剧性的效果
and this is a very dramatic effect
从而使怀孕的动物流产或重吸收胎儿
whereby a pregnant animal will abort or reabsorb her fetus
如果那些动物的父亲
if the dad of those animals,
围着一窝的父亲  
the father that sired the litter,
因为它们是动物  所以它们是一窝
because these are animals, they're litters,
这父亲被移走  并且在她附近放置了一个新男性
is removed and a novel male is placed in her vicinity
大约48个小时  
for about 48 hours,
有趣的是这发生这个的原因
and what's interesting is the way that this happens
是来自男性尿液的信息素
is a pheromone that comes from male urine
激活促性腺激素释放激素系统
activates the gonadotropin-releasing hormone system
并导致发情周期的重新引入
and causes a reintroduction of the estrus cycle
并自然流产胎儿
and a spontaneous abortion of the fetus.
那么  很多人都采取了布鲁斯效应
Now, a lot of people have taken the Bruce effect
有点极端
kind of to its extreme
问人类流产是否
and asked whether or not in humans,
也是由信息素引起的
miscarriages are caused by detecting the pheromones
检测到新男性的气味  即非爸爸男性  
or odors of novel males, meaning the non-dad male,
这仍然是一个悬而未决的问题  
and that's still an open question,
没有人知道那是真的  
nobody knows if that's true or not,
所以我想强调一下
so I want to emphasize that.
另一个是范登堡效应  
The other one is the Vandenbergh effect,
这是我提到的
and this is one I alluded to
在播客的上一集中
in a previous episode of the podcast,
就是可以加快女性的青春期
which is that puberty in females can be accelerated
通过安置一个新的具有性能力的男性
by placing a novel sexually competent male
和一个没有青春期的年轻女性在一起
in with a young female who has not undergone puberty.
还有一个版本  我没有描述  
There's also a version of this, which I haven't described,
这是青春期的延迟
which is delay of puberty
你带幼小的雌性动物
where you take juvenile female animals
没有青春期的人
that have not undergone puberty
然后把它们和更成熟的雌性放在一起
and you put them with more mature females
同一物种
of the same species,
而且引进更多女性会导致延误  
and that introduction of more females will cause a delay,
青春期开始明显延迟
a significant delay in the onset of puberty.
这些都是信息素的作用  
So these are all pheromone effects,
而且我们知道它们是信息素效应
and we know they're pheromone effects
因为他们没有意识
because they're not conscious,
他们也不需要实际联系
they also don't require actual contact
与给定物种的其他成员  
with the other members of a given species,
这些都是可以介导的效果
these are all effects that can be mediated
通过给定物种的尿液
by the urine from a given species
或由于特定物种的汗水  
or by the sweat of a given species,
说到汗水  一种信息素的作用
and speaking of sweat, the one pheromone effect
我从已出版的文献中非常了解
that I'm very aware of from the published literature
是1998年发表的论文
is a paper that was published in 1998
斯特恩和麦克林托克
by Stern and McClintock
这是在问这个问题
which was getting at this question
月经周期同步
of synchronization of menstrual cycles.
那么  同步月经周期的整个想法
Now, the whole idea of synchronization of menstrual cycles
很有争议
is pretty controversial,
人们说  很长一段时间  
for a long time, people said,
“哦  这绝对是一个很明显的现象  ”
"Oh, this is absolutely a well-characterized phenomenon,"
宿舍里的人
people in dormitories,
她们的月经周期会同步  
their menstrual cycles would synchronize,
人们一起生活在环境中
people living in environments together,
她们的月经周期会同步  
their menstrual cycles would synchronize,
然后一些研究出来了
and then some studies came out
这种削弱了这些数据
that kind of undercut those data
说不  实际上不会发生  
and said no, this actually doesn't happen,
这有点争议
and it was kind of controversial,
但是效果很明显
but there is a very clear effect
斯特恩（Stern）和麦克林托克（McClintock）描述了
that was described by Stern and McClintock,
他们实际上所做的是把女性带走了  
what they did actually was they took females,
他们绘制了周期图
they charted their cycles,
然后他们让其他女性在腋窝里戴着小垫子
and then they had other females wear pads in their armpits
它们从这些雌性身上吸了汗  
and they collected sweat from those females,
然后实验者从那些垫子上吸了汗
and then they took the sweat from those pads
从那些女性的腋下去出
in those female's armpits,
然后把它们带给
and they introduced them to women
从未与流汗的人接触过的女人
who had never had contact with the people who had sweated,
她们只是与汗水接触  
they only had contact with their sweat,
实际上  她们在鼻子下面擦拭它  
in fact, they swabbed it underneath their nose,
听起来很恶心  但可以用酒精将其稀释  
and if that sounds gross, they dilute it in alcohol,
如此之多  以至于他们实际上无法检测到
so much so that they can't actually detect
汗水的气味  
the odor of the sweat,
这实际上非常重要  因为它不是气味  
that's actually very important because it's not the smell,
这是信息素本身
it's the pheromone chemical itself,
结果证明了信息素本身
and it turns out the pheromone chemical itself
可以调节月经周期
can modulate the menstrual cycle,
尽管不一定同步
although it doesn't necessarily synchronize it
和汗水 
with the sweater,
它所做的是改变
what it does is it changes
排卵的时间和方式
the duration and the pattern of ovulation
相对于所谓的卵泡期
relative to the so-called follicular phase,
长话短说
long and short of this
是女性的汗水和信息素
is that the sweat and pheromones of females
可以调节月经周期
can modulate the menstrual cycle patterns
其他成年女性
of other adult females,
这只是她们是否同步的问题  
it's just a question of whether or not they synchronize,
如果你现在快睡出来了
and if you're kind of rolling your eyes now
然后说：“当然  他们会这么做
and saying, "Well, of course they do,
“这真的很详细  ”
"and this is really detailed,"
这就是科学的完成方式  
this is how the science is done,
以及人们如此怀疑的原因
and the reason why people are so skeptical
关于人类中信息素效应的存在
about the presence of pheromone effects in humans
是因为  我们没有明确的信息素器官  
is that there's no well-identified pheromone organ,
你知道  我们有一个鼻子区域
you know, we have an area of our nose
这是造成气味的原因  这是公认的
that's responsible for smelling, that's well-established,
在核磁共振成像中已经观察到很多次了  
it's been observed in MRIs many, many times,
在尸体中  看到过很多次
in cadavers many, many times,
在几乎所有的人中  
in pretty much all individuals,
但是犁鼻器
but the vomeronasal organ,
是信息素检测器官
which is the pheromone-detecting organ,
在人类中尚未真正发现  
hasn't really been found in humans,
有个叫雅各布森的器官
there's something called Jacobson's organ,
被认为是鼻子的器官
which is thought to be the organ in the nose,
它实际上是在嘴顶的顶部
it's actually on the top of the roof of the mouth
像鼻梁一样
and in the kind of back of the nose,
这是给你的品酒师  
this is for you wine tasters,
我永远不会发音
I never can pronounce this,
他们叫什么  侍酒师  之类的  随便啦
what are they called, sommelier, whatevers,
善于喝酒的人
the people that are excellent at drinking
他们闻葡萄酒的香气
and detecting the essences of wine
你必须通过所有这些测试
that you have to go through all these tests
才能考出一个证之类的 
in order to get certified as one of them,
我真的不知道
somebody tell me,
他们可能正在使用类似的机制
they are using probably a similar mechanism
混合味道和气味  
of mixing taste and smell,
还有雅各布森器官  如果存在的话  
and Jacobson's organ, if it exists,
人类的犁鼻等效物  
the vomeronasal equivalent in humans,
被认为是气味和味道的结合
is thought to be a combination of smell and taste.
那么  更加奇怪和酷的事情
Now, it gets even weirder and cooler
当你考虑在人类中完成的一项给定研究时
when you think about a given study that was done in humans
如果你从男友那里买几百件T恤  
where if you take hundreds of t-shirts from boyfriends,
将它们分开
keep them separate,
你拿那些T恤  
you take those t-shirts,
你分别洗了很多遍
you wash them many times separately,
然后把它们提供给女友  
and then you offer them to the girlfriends,
这些家伙的长期伙伴  
the long-time partners of those guys,
你会发现那个女友
and what you'll find is that the girlfriend
可以挑选男朋友的T恤
can pick out her boyfriend's t-shirt
在其他数百种T恤中  
among hundreds of other t-shirts,
不是因为闻起来不一样
not because it smells different,
但是因为有种感觉似乎有所不同  
but because something about it seems different,
可能跟她闻起来不一样
it might smell different to her
在某种程度上  即使是她也无法察觉  
in some way that's kind of imperceptible even to her,
以及检测该T恤的准确性水平  
and the level of accuracy in detecting that t-shirt,
她伴侣的T恤  
her partner's t-shirt,
远高于统计上的重要阈值  
is way above statistical significant thresholds,
如此之多  以至于你几乎不得不说
so much so that you almost have to say
其中的原因
there's something about these effects
好像真的是信息素效应  
that are real pheromone effects,
尽管人们仍然争论
although people still argue
在人类中没有信息素的作用  
that there are no pheromone effects in humans,
都是通过嗅觉  
that it's all through olfaction,
我认为这些很有趣并且很重要
I think these are interesting and important to understand
因为这意味着很多事情
because it means that a lot of things
通过我们的鼻子
coming through our nose,
不管是信息素还是气味  
whether or not it's pheromones or smells,
影响激素和我们的记忆力
are impacting hormones and our ability to attach memories
以及对同伴和其他人的认可  
and kind of recognition of mates and other people,
包括我们的孩子  而不仅仅是我们的同伴  
including our children, not just our mates,
当然  香水制造商
and of course, perfume manufacturers
真正了解了信息素的想法
have really picked up on the idea of pheromones
并建立了整个实验室
and have entire laboratories set up
将化合物制成香水
to build chemical compounds into perfumes
旨在吸引其他同伴  
that are designed to attract other mates,
这是一个成熟的  有据可查的现象
this is a well-established and well-documented phenomenon.
最后我要介绍的信息素
And the last point I'll make about pheromones
是味道和气味的结合
is that this combination of taste and smell
在动物界如此真实
is such a real thing in the animal world
有一种叫做flehmen反应的东西  
that there's something called the flehmen response,
在不同动物的交配季节  
during the mating seasons for different animals,
实际上  你甚至可以在马匹中看到这一点  
you can actually even see this in horses,
但是对于季节性的动物  
but for animals that are seasonal maters,
他们会做所谓的flehmen反应
they'll do something called the flehmen response
他们实际上张开嘴唇和嘴巴的地方
where they actually open their lips and their mouth
他们露出牙龈
and they expose their gums
这样他们就可以捕获信息素
so that they can capture pheromones
在环境中随风飘扬的信息素
that are floating in the wind in the environment,
他们实际上是在寻找伴侣
they actually are looking for mates
用他们的嘴和周围的嗅探
using their mouth and kind of sniffing around.
如果你有狗
If you own a dog
你会看到狗闻闻的方式
and you watch the way that the dog will sniff around
选择他们想要小便的地方  雄性和雌性都这样
selecting where they want to urinate, males and females,
他们将分子带入他们的鼻子  
they're bringing molecules into their nose,
我知道这听起来有点恶心  闻着尿液  
I know it sounds kind of gross, sniffing urine,
但是动物尿液中有很多信息素  
but there are a lot of pheromones in urine of animals,
许多在风中移动的信息素  
a lot of pheromones that are traveling in the wind,
再说一次  不管这是否发生在人类中  
again, whether or not this is happening in humans,
我不知道  但是后来你想到了香水  
I don't know, but then you think about the perfume thing,
人们在这里把这些气味放在自己身上
and here people are putting these scents on themselves
包含推定的信息素  人类信息素
that contain putative pheromones, human pheromones,
并四处走走  希望他们的气味
and walking around hoping that their scents
会引起寻求伴侣的行为
are going to evoke mate-seeking behavior
来自同一人类的其他个体  
from other individuals of the same human species,
所以我们是这种行为中的动物
so we are among the animals in this behavior,
与你是否相信无关
independent of whether or not you believe
存在信息素效应
pheromone effects exist.
让我们回到行为
So let's get back to behaviors
可以帮助优化激素水平
that can help optimize hormone levels.
已显示的主要行为之一
One of the main behaviors that's been shown
在有卵巢的人身上
to be associated with poor levels of estrogen
  随着年龄变化 雌激素水平低下
relative to age-match controls for people with ovaries
或对于有睾丸的人来说
or lower levels of testosterone
更低水平的睾丸激素
compared to age-match controls
  是呼吸暂停  
for people with testes, is apnea,
呼吸暂停与呼吸不足有关
apnea has everything to do with under-breathing
体内积聚了太多的二氧化碳  
and the buildup of too much carbon dioxide in the body,
呼吸暂停也有其他作用  
there are other effects of apnea as well,
但如果整个故事都有一致的文献
but if there's a consistent literature in this whole story
关于衰老和激素减少
about aging and reductions in hormones
以及一般的健康状况和激素的减少  这就是呼吸暂停
and general health and reductions in hormones, it's apnea.
我深入研究了更年期的文献  
I went deep into the literature on advanced menopause,
或更年期症状加剧时  
or when menopausal symptoms are exacerbated,
然后我进入了有关更年期的文献  
and I went into the literature on andropause,
或更早的男性更年期
or early-onset andropause,
或睾丸激素水平
or levels of testosterone
远低于给定年龄段的数值  
that are far lower than they should be for a given age,
在每种情况下  你都可以找到多篇论文
and in every case, you could find multiple papers
表明呼吸暂停或呼吸效率低下
that show that apnea, or poor efficiency of breathing
并在体内积聚过多的二氧化碳
and buildup of too much carbon dioxide in the body
是一个问题  
was a problem,
大部分是睡眠呼吸暂停
mostly sleep apnea,
尽管总体上显示呼吸暂停是一个比较大的问题
although apnea in general was shown to be an issue
会对荷尔蒙产生负面影响
negatively impacting hormones.
那么  这种效果的方向性尚不完全清楚  
Now, the directionality of this effect isn't entirely clear,
雌激素减少可能导致呼吸暂停  
it could be that reductions in estrogen cause apnea,
实际上  有一些原因
and actually, there's some reason
相信可能是这样  
to believe that might be the case,
我发现至少有一篇论文
I found at least one paper
表明存在雌激素受体
showing that there are estrogen receptors
在实际上支配肺部的某些神经元上
on some of the neurons that actually innervate the lungs
并允许感知
and allow for the perception
肺有多丰满或多空
of how full or empty the lungs are,
换句话说  雌激素的减少可能会调节呼吸
in other words, reductions in estrogen may adjust breathing
通过改变我们对自己肺部的敏感性  
by changing our sensitivity to our own lungs,
那么  男性和女性都是如此  
now, that was true for males and females,
请记住  雌激素在男性和女性体内都有  
remember, estrogen is both males and females,
但同时  我发现了减少睾丸激素的论文
but as well, I found papers in which testosterone reductions
与呼吸暂停有关
were associated with apnea,
还发现了睾丸激素受体
and testosterone receptors are also found
在所谓的内脏的许多细胞上
on a lot of cells in the so-called viscera,
包括肺
including the lungs,
同样  效果的方向性尚不清楚  
so again, the directionality of the effect isn't clear,
但是真正有趣的是
but what's really interesting
有很清楚的方法
is that there are very clear ways
在哪种呼吸方式下
in which patterns of breathing,
尤其是睡眠中的呼吸方式
especially patterns of breathing in sleep,
可以调节激素
can modulate hormones
可以立即采取行动的方式
in ways that are immediately actionable
并可以同时优化雌激素和睾丸激素
and can serve to optimize both estrogen and testosterone
不管你是否有卵巢或睾丸
regardless of whether or not you have ovaries or testes.
那么什么是呼吸暂停呢？
So what is apnea?
呼吸暂停不足  
Apnea is under-breathing,
或主要是在睡眠中停止呼吸  
or mainly, cessation of breathing during sleep,
人们屏住呼吸  
so people are holding their breath,
然后他们会突然醒来  
and then they'll suddenly wake up,
其实我说的是生理上的叹息
and actually I've talked about the physiological sigh
在此播客的前几集中  
on previous episodes of this podcast,
两次吸气然后呼气的模式
of this pattern of double inhales followed by exhales
可以有意识地减轻压力和焦虑
that one can do consciously to reduce stress and anxiety
并减少二氧化碳的排放
and offload carbon dioxide,
那种呼吸
that pattern of breathing
每当我们在睡眠中出现呼吸暂停发作时 
is actually what kicks in spontaneously
 实际上生理叹息是会自发地发生
anytime we have an apnea episode in sleep,
尽管在许多患有呼吸暂停的人中
although in many people who have apnea,
他们没有生理上的叹息
they don't engage the physiological sigh.
超重的人
People who are dramatically overweight
在睡眠中也会遭受呼吸暂停的困扰  
also suffer a lot from apnea during sleep,
实际上体内的二氧化碳
there's actually a lot of buildup
有很多积累
of carbon dioxide in the body,
这会导致白天过度困倦  
and that can lead to excessive sleepiness during the day,
无法进入更深层次的睡眠  
inability to access the deeper phases of sleep,
有充分的理由进入深度睡眠
and it's well-established that going into deep sleep
并获得正确的模式
and getting the proper patterns
慢波睡眠和快速眼动睡眠
of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep
对激素优化很重要
are important for hormone optimization.
我谈到了如何调节睡眠和优化睡眠
I talked about how to modulate sleep and optimize sleep
在“HubermanLab播客”的第一个月  
in the first month of the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"
因此  如果你有睡眠问题  请查看这些播客
so please check out those episodes if you have sleep issues
或者你想睡个好觉  
or you want to work on your sleep,
还可以查看马特·沃克（Matt Walker）的绝妙著作《Why We Sleep》
also check out Matt Walker's terrific book, "Why We Sleep,"
这将帮助你找到各种协议
and that will help you find various protocols
为了帮助你优化睡眠  
to help you optimize your sleep,
但是呼吸本身的问题
but the issue of breathing itself
可以在白天的醒来时间进行调整
can be adjusted in the daytime waking hours
可以强烈影响睡眠的方式  
in ways that can powerfully impact both sleep,
减少睡眠呼吸暂停的发生  
reduce incidents of sleep apnea,
显然是从一些新兴的文学作品中
and apparently from some emerging literature,
还可以帮助优化各种激素
can also help to optimize various hormones
即使只是在醒着时以特定方式呼吸
even just by breathing in particular ways while awake.
接下来讲一下它的工作原理  
So here's how this works,
现在有很多文献
there's now a lot of literature
表现出通过鼻子呼吸
showing that breathing through the nose,
不能通过嘴巴
not through the mouth,
在改善很多事情方面功能强大  
is powerful for improving lots of things,
首先  它有美容功能
first of all, it improves cosmetic features
下巴和脸
of the jaw and face,
这是我在斯坦福大学的同事们首先建立的
this was first well-established by my colleagues at Stanford
在一本名为《下巴：隐藏性流行病的故事》的书中  
in a book called "Jaws: The Story of a Hidden Epidemic,"
这是桑德拉·卡恩（Sandra Kahn）和保罗·埃里希（Paul Ehrlich）的作品  
this is by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich,
他们都是斯坦福大学的老师
who are both faculty at Stanford,
罗伯特·萨波斯基（Robert Sapolsky）写了序  
has a forward by Robert Sapolsky, the great Robert Sapolsky,
而且它还具有很强的前期认可
and it also has a heavy endorsement upfront
由《枪支  病菌和钢铁》的作者Jared Diamond撰写  
by Jared Diamond, the author of "Guns, Germs, and Steel,"
普利策奖得主  
the Pulitzer winner,
所以这本书的“ Jaws”上有很多重量级作者
so a lot of heavy hitters on this book, "Jaws."
这本书不是很多人
It's not a book that a lot of people
不幸的是知道
know about, unfortunately,
但是它确实描述了鼻呼吸的好处
but it really describes the benefits of nasal breathing
以及人们在发生可怕的事情时
and the terrible things that happen when people,
特别是儿童  但成年人也
in particular children, but adults also,
是沉重的口呼吸  
are heavy mouth-breathers,
所以口呼吸有变化
so mouth-breathers have changes
对他们的脸和下巴的美容功效
in the cosmetics of their face and jaw
就吸引力而言  这确实很糟糕  
that are really bad in terms of attractiveness,
这是在双胞胎研究中完成的
and this was done in twin studies,
你可以在书中查看并看到其中的一些内容  
you can look in the book and see some of this,
真是戏剧性  口呼吸
it's really dramatic how being a mouth-breather
容易使下巴退回上颌骨后方  
tends to make the chin drop back behind the upper mandible,
脸上拉长  眼睛下垂  
there's a lengthening in the face, a drooping of the eyes,
它可能非常戏剧化或温和的变化
it can be quite dramatic or modest
取决于呼吸多少
depending on how much mouth-breathing.
那么  有时候我们不得不用嘴呼吸  
Now, sometimes we have to breathe with our mouths,
但也有很多数据和研究
but there's also a lot of data and studies
本书中描述的“下巴”
described in this book, "Jaws,"
描述在清醒和睡眠中鼻呼吸如何
that describe how nose-breathing in wakefulness and in sleep
促进各种积极的事情
promotes all sorts of positive things
不仅与美容有关  
related to not just cosmetics,
而且改善了气体交换
but also the improvement of gas exchange
体内的二氧化碳和氧气
of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the body,
而且  它可以修改级别
and as well, it can modify levels
不同的神经递质和神经调节剂
of different neurotransmitters and neuromodulators
以对荷尔蒙产生积极影响的方式
in ways that positively can impact hormones,
信不信由你  做个鼻呼吸
so believe it or not, being a nasal-breather
并避免成为口呼吸
and avoiding being a mouth-breather
实际上可以对荷尔蒙产生积极影响  
can actually positively impact hormones,
特别是荷尔蒙睾丸激素和雌激素  
and in particular, the hormones testosterone and estrogen,
虽然这样做的方式
although the way that it does that
是通过让你成为更好的睡眠者
is by making you a better sleeper,
这可以让你产生更多的睾丸激素
which allows you to produce more testosterone
以及适量的睾丸激素和雌激素  
and the appropriate amounts of testosterone and estrogen,
但这部分是通过间接机制实现的
but it does that in part through indirect mechanisms
因为深度睡眠支持性腺  
because deep sleep supports the gonads,
卵巢和睾丸
the ovaries and the testicles
细胞的周转和细胞的产生  
and their turnover of cells and the production of cells,
记住  在卵巢中  特定的细胞
remember, in the ovary, particular cells
卵泡本身会产生雌激素
and the egg follicles themselves make estrogen,
在睾丸中
and in the testicle,
sertoli细胞和Leydig细胞 
that the sertoli cells and the Leydig cells
对精子的形成很重要
are important for the formation of sperm
对睾丸激素也很重要
and for testosterone, respectively.
那么  这意味着什么？
So what does this all mean?
这意味着我们必须呼吸正常  
This means we have to be breathing properly,
听起来好像有点创新  
it almost sounds kind of like, kind of new-agey,
就像  哦  你必须适当呼吸
like, oh, you have to breathe properly
使你的荷尔蒙正确
to get your hormones right,
但没有  你必须呼吸正常
but no, you have to breathe properly
呼吸和睡眠良好
to get your breathing and sleep right
这样你的睡眠就可以足够深
so that your sleep can actually be deep enough
而且你没有进入呼吸暂停状态  
and you're not entering apnea states,
然后将支持性腺功能  
and then that will support gonad function,
而且我先把这个事情讲出来
and I wouldn't be putting this out
是因为它将是预先的主要行为工具之一
as one of the main behavioral tools upfront
因为真的
if it weren't for the fact
呼吸暂停对这些激素的影响
that the effects of apnea on these hormones
非常之大  并且很可怕
are dramatic and terrible,
正确呼吸对于这些激素的积极作用
and the positive effects of getting breathing right
睾丸激素和雌激素
on these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,
生动而精彩
are dramatic and wonderful,
因此  让我们简要地谈谈其中的一些研究
so let's talk about a few of those studies briefly
所以我可以强调适当呼吸的价值
so I can underscore the value of proper breathing
为了优化激素
in order to optimize hormones.
所以我至少找到了四项质量研究
So I was able to find at least four quality studies
表明当呼吸暂停减少或消除时  
showing that when apnea is reduced in sleep, or eliminated,
男性的睾丸激素显着增加
there are significant increases in testosterone in males
在雌性中雌激素与睾丸激素的比例适当时  
and in proper estrogen to testosterone ratios in females,
它的运作方式非常有趣
and the way that it works is very interesting,
显然  它的作用是减少皮质醇  
apparently, it works by reductions in cortisol,
那么  皮质醇是一种压力激素
now, cortisol is a stress hormone
当我们早上醒来时发布
that is released early in the day as we wake up
并在保护我们免受感染方面发挥健康作用  
and serves healthy roles in protecting us against infection,
减轻炎症等
reducing inflammation, et cetera,
但是你不希望皮质醇过高  
but you don't want cortisol to be too high,
而且你当然不希望它升高太长时间
and you certainly don't want it elevated too long
在白天和黑夜中  
throughout the day and night,
所以我们都知道
and so we all know,
因为在过去十年左右的时间里  我们被告知很多  
because now we've been told a lot in the last decade or so,
保证充足的睡眠很重要
that getting proper sleep is important
对于健康的所有这些方面  
for all these aspects of health,
充足的睡眠确实可以抵消
getting proper sleep can really offset
所有睾丸激素和雌激素的减少
all the reductions in testosterone and estrogen
和发生的生育力下降
and reductions in fertility that occur
如果我们睡眠不足
if we don't get enough sleep,
但很少讨论如何睡觉
but seldom is it discussed how sleep
才能实际去调节睾丸激素和雌激素
actually adjusts things like testosterone and estrogen,
它是通过修饰皮质醇来实现的  
and it does it by modifying cortisol,
所以分子胆固醇
so the molecule cholesterol
可以转化成睾丸激素或雌激素
can be converted into testosterone or estrogen,
但是有比赛
but there's a competition
胆固醇会变成皮质醇
whereby the cholesterol will turn into cortisol
而不是睾丸激素  
and not testosterone,
否则会变成皮质醇而不是雌激素
or it'll turn into cortisol and not estrogen
如果压力太高  
if stress levels are too high,
所以这个简单的版本
so the simple version of this
在醒着的时候呼吸正好  
is getting your breathing right during the waking hours,
主要是指  除非你非常努力
meaning primarily, unless you're working out really hard
或还有其他原因  
or there's some other reason why,
你可能在吃饭或说话
you're maybe eating or speaking,
你需要通过嘴呼吸  
that you need to be breathing through your mouth,
你应该是一个鼻呼吸  
you should be a nose-breather,
现在确实有很好的证据  
there's really good evidence for that now,
而在睡眠中  你也想成为鼻呼吸
and in sleep, you also want to be a nose-breather
因为那会增加氧气的量
because that's going to increase the amount of oxygen
你要带入系统中
that you're bringing into your system
以及你要卸载的二氧化碳量  
and the amount of carbon dioxide that you're offloading,
它也有其他积极作用  
there are other positive effects of it as well,
但你基本上是在减少呼吸暂停  
but you're basically reducing apnea,
屏住呼吸导致二氧化碳积聚
breath-holding in sleep leads to buildup of carbon dioxide
并导致皮质醇增加  
and leads to increases in cortisol,
然后减少睾丸激素并减少雌激素
which then decrease testosterone and decrease estrogen
是非常不好的  所有性别都是这样  好吗？
in negative ways across all sexes, okay?
所以这个简单的版本可以让你呼吸正常  
So the simple version of this is get your breathing right,
那么你该怎么做  如何正确呼吸呢？
so how do you do that, how do you get your breathing right?
好吧  对于某些患有严重睡眠呼吸暂停的人  
Well, for some people that have severe sleep apnea,
他们将需要CPAP机器  
they are going to need the CPAP machine,
这是一台你实际戴在脸上的仪器
this is a machine that you actually put on your face
它可以帮助你在睡眠中正确呼吸
and it helps you breathe properly in sleep.
但是  许多人开始做这件事
Many people, however, are starting to do this thing
把嘴用某种方法封上
of taping their mouths shut,
那么  这听起来有点极端  
now, this sounds a little bit extreme,
而且你当然不想这样做
and you certainly don't want to do this
以任何危险的方式
in any way that's dangerous.
詹姆斯·内斯特（James Nestor）在他的书中谈到了这一点  
James Nestor talked about this in his book,
“呼吸：失去的艺术的新科学”  
"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,"
只是拍拍就合上嘴巴  
that simply taping shut the mouth,
用一些胶带可以让你
with some tape that will allow you
如果真的需要张开嘴  
to open your mouth if you really need to,
睡觉时可以让人们转移
during sleep can allow people to shift over
从成为口鼻呼吸者和打者到鼻息者
from being mouth-breathers and snorers to nose-breathers.
在白天  锻炼鼻呼吸的最佳方法
In the daytime, the best way to get good at nasal-breathing
就是扩大鼻腔  
is to dilate the nasal passages,
因为很多人很难去
'cause a lot of people have a hard time
通过他们的鼻子呼吸
breathing through their nose,
做到这一点的一种方法
and one way to do this
就是更多地通过鼻子呼吸  
is to just breathe through your nose more,
锻炼的一种方法是当你运动时
and one way to do that is when you exercise,
特别是心血管运动
in particular, cardiovascular exercise,
在大多数情况下  只要你不花力气  
most of the time, provided you're not in maximum effort,
你应该用鼻呼吸
you should be nasal-breathing.
那么  对于很多人来说
Now, for a lot of people,
刚开始锻炼时  鼻呼吸很难  
nasal-breathing during exercise is hard at first,
但是当你这样做的时候  
but as you do it,
因为鼻窦有能力随着时间的流逝而扩张  
because the sinuses have a capacity to dilate over time,
你会做得更好
you'll get better at it,
鼻窦  如果你从未握过头骨  
the sinuses, if you haven't ever held a skull for,
因为我作为神经科学家的工作  
because of my job as a neuroscientist,
我已经抓了很多头骨
I've held a lot of skulls,
从许多头骨中夺走了很多大脑  
taken a lot of brains out of a lot of skulls,
我教神经解剖学  为此  
I teach neuroanatomy, and I've done that for,
天哪  天知道我解剖过多少种……
goodness, god knows how many species
包括人类在内  
I've done that for, including human,
但是罪恶是他们实际上是
but what the sinuses are is they're actually,
你拥有的是这些小门户
what you've got are you got these little portals
在那骨头里  你知道  在这里和在这里  
in the bone that run, you know, up here and down here,
鼻子后面和下巴  
behind the nose and into the jaw,
如果你感冒了  并且鼻窦塞满了  
if you ever had a cold and your sinuses are stuffed up,
你觉得你在这里和这里都拥挤
you feel like you have congestion here and here
在你的耳朵  脸颊和脸上
and around your ears and in your cheeks and in your face,
那是因为鼻窦
and that's because the sinuses
实际上是骨骼融合在一起的门户
are actually portals where the bones are fused together
并像这样交叉
and interdigitated like this,
但它们当然衬有粘液膜
but they're lined, of course, with mucus membranes,
随着你开始鼻呼吸  
and as you start to nasal-breathe more,
鼻道会开始扩张更多  
the nasal passages will start to dilate more,
别担心  你不会有巨大的鼻孔  
don't worry, you're not going to get giant nostrils,
但是最终会发生什么
but what's going to end up happening
你会过得更轻松吗
is you're going to have an easier time
醒来只是通过鼻子呼吸  
breathing through your nose just from waking,
所以我的建议是
so my advice would be
锻炼时通过鼻子呼吸
breathe through your nose while exercising
除非你正在冲刺
unless you're in maximum effort,
很快  你会发现
pretty soon, what you'll find
你真的可以创造更多的气体输出
is you actually can create more output
比起你用嘴呼吸时要多
than you would if you were breathing through your mouth,
当然  也有例外
and of course, there are exceptions to this,
如果你正在游泳  请遵循该呼吸协议  
if you're swimming, follow that breath protocol,
对于战士和武术家来说  
for fighters and martial artists,
有理由去做
there's reason to do
那种通过嘴呼吸的呼气  
the kind of exhale breathing through the mouth,
那样的事情  
that shh kind of thing,
你知道  这样做是有原因的
you know, there are reasons to do that sort of thing
对于特定的运动  
for particular sports,
但是对于大多数
but for most people who are
一种娱乐性的运动员或运动者  
kind of recreational athletes or exercisers,
学会做鼻呼吸  
learn to be a nasal-breather,
它具有积极的美容效果  
it has positive cosmetic effects,
它减少了呼吸暂停  减轻了二氧化碳的负担  
it reduces apnea, it offloads more carbon dioxide,
它增加了肺活量  扩张了鼻窦  
it increases lung capacity, it dilates the sinuses,
它可以防止睡眠中的呼吸暂停
and it prevents apnea in sleep,
因此  除非你患有严重的呼吸暂停并需要CPAP  
so unless you have severe apnea and you need the CPAP,
变成鼻呼吸
becoming a nasal-breather
可以产生各种各样的积极影响
can have all sorts of positive effects
通过减少皮质醇  减少呼吸暂停  
by reducing cortisol, reducing apnea,
间接地增加睾丸激素和雌激素
and indirectly, raising testosterone and estrogen
以适当的比例  
in the proper ratios,
因此  这似乎是基础的和间接的  
so this might seem kind of foundational and indirect,
但是当你进入科学文献时  
but when you go into the scientific literature,
它是最强大的东西之一
it comes through as one of the most powerful things
你可以做到的是零成本  
that you can do that is zero cost,
需要一点努力  但成本为零  
takes a little effort but it's zero cost,
并具有所有这些积极影响  
and it has all of these positive effects across the board,
你知道  美容啊
you know, both cosmetic
睡眠啊  荷尔蒙等等
and in sleep and hormonal, et cetera,
所以这是第一条行为建议
so that's the first piece of behavioral advice.
第二条行为建议
The second piece of behavioral advice
与光的观察有关  
relates to the viewing of light,
你们当中许多人以前听过我谈论过这个话题  
and many of you have heard me talk about this before,
而且我不会太在意这一点
and I'm not going to belabor the point
在醒来的头一个小时内看到明亮的光线  
that viewing bright light within the first hour of waking,
是否来自人造光
whether or not it's from artificial light
或理想情况下  在阳光下
or ideally, from sunlight,
对睡眠和清醒有这些强大的影响  
has these powerful effects on sleep and wakefulness,
但是我们必须回到这个
but we have to return to this
如果你想了解光如何影响荷尔蒙
if you want to understand how light can impact hormones
因为荷尔蒙  光和多巴胺
because hormones, light, and dopamine
有着非常紧密的联系
have a very close-knit relationship,
如此之多  以至于你的视线行为
so much so that your light-viewing behavior
实际上可以产生直接影响
can actually have a direct effect
在激素水平和生育力上  
on hormone levels and fertility,
它可以直接影响激素水平和性欲  
it can have a direct effect on hormone levels and libido,
它可以直接影响激素水平
it can have a direct effect on hormone levels
和你快速康复的能力  
and your ability to heal quickly,
我不是在谈论闪耀的光芒
and I'm not talking about shining light
在特殊伤害下  
on particular injuries,
可能会或可能不会产生积极影响  
that may or may not have positive effects,
我们可以在随后的播客中争论这一点  它可能会
we can argue about that on a subsequent episode, it may,
但是我说的是用眼睛看光
but what I'm talking about is viewing light with your eyes,
所以现在让我们谈谈
so let's talk about that now
因为关于这方面的科学文献是可靠的
because the scientific literature on this are robust
他们可以追溯到几十年前
and they extend back several decades,
但是  我认为大多数人不是很了解
and yet, I think most people don't really understand
这种关系有多强大
how powerful this relationship is
在光  多巴胺  激素之间
between light, dopamine, hormones,
以及性类固醇激素所做的所有超棒的事情
and all the great things that the sex steroid hormones do
当它们以适当的比例存在于你的体内时
when they're available in your body in the proper ratios.
为了了解光线
In order to understand the powerful effects
对性类固醇激素产生的强大作用
that light can have on the sex steroid hormones,
我们需要了解季节性繁殖动物
we need to understand seasonal breeding animals,
人类不是季节性繁殖者  
now, humans are not seasonal breeders,
但是如果你了解生物学
but if you understand the biology
光线如何影响各种神经递质和激素  
of how light impacts various neurotransmitters and hormones,
你将有深刻的了解  改变自己
you'll set yourself up for a deep understanding
你应该如何进行光观察行为
of what you should do with your light-viewing behavior.
有几种动物  
So several species of animals,
实际上  许多动物种类  例如兔子和狐狸  
many species of animals, in fact, like rabbits and fox,
还有各种鼬类动物  例如雪貂和大白鼬  
and various mustelids, like ferrets and ermines,
随季节改变其皮毛颜色  
change their pellage color across the seasons,
这可能有点不对劲  
this might be kind of a duh,
但是冬天的狐狸通常是白色或浅灰色  
but fox in winter are often white or light gray,
而那些相同的动物将是棕色或深色
and those same animals will be brown or darker-colored
在夏季和春季
in the summertime and spring months.
那么  这些动物在春天繁殖  
Now, those same animals breed in the spring,
它们停止了繁殖  
and they shut down breeding,
它们实际上关闭了排卵  
they actually shut down ovulation,
它们经常关闭睾丸激素的生产
they often shut down testosterone production
在冬季  
in the winter months,
所以现在我只是将皮毛的颜色
so right now I'm just correlating color of fur
与繁殖的倾向  想联系起来
with tendency to breed,
我们知道  繁殖趋势是与
tendency to breed, as we know, is going to be related
性类固醇激素的水平相关
to the levels of sex steroid hormones,
雌激素和睾丸激素
estrogen and testosterone.
那么  为什么要将这两件事联系起来？
Now, why would these two things be linked?
好吧  事实证明  多巴胺是它们之间的联系  
Well, it turns out that dopamine is the link between them,
所以多巴胺有一个前体  那个前体是酪氨酸  
so dopamine has a precursor, that precursor is tyrosine,
是氨基酸  来自食物
which is amino acid, comes from food,
正如我前面提到的  当多巴胺水平很高时  
and when dopamine levels are high, as I mentioned before,
有一种促性腺激素释放激素的趋势  
there's a tendency for more gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
黄体生成素  促卵泡激素  
luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,
所有的激素
all the hormones that come
从下丘脑-垂体轴
from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
刺激雌激素和睾丸激素释放
and stimulate estrogen and testosterone release
从卵巢和睾丸中释放
from the ovary and testes,
多巴胺基本上可以增加所有这些
dopamine basically increases all of that.
多巴胺的前体是酪氨酸  
The precursor to dopamine is tyrosine,
但是很多东西的先驱
but the precursor to a lot
细胞中产生黑色素的成分
of the melanin-producing elements of cells
产生色素沉着  包括头发颜色的色素
that give pigmentation, including for the hair,
是酪氨酸和酪氨酸酶  一种酶  
is tyrosine and tyrosinase, an enzyme,
是的  基于氨基酸的相同途径  
so yes, the same amino acid-based pathway,
以及许多与多巴胺相同的酶
and many of the same enzymes that are devoted to dopamine
和多巴胺增加性类固醇激素
and dopamine increasing the sex steroid hormones
致力于使头发和皮肤色素沉着  
are devoted to giving pigmentation to the hair and skin,
这就是为什么在夏季  当日子更长的时候  
and this is why in the summer months, when days are longer,
动物繁殖更多  
animals are breeding more,
这也是为什么在冬季
and this is also why in the winter months
当日子较短时  动物的繁殖就更少了
when days are shorter, animals are breeding less,
这也是为什么在人类中  很多人  而不是所有人  
this is also why in humans, many people, not all,
在春季和夏季的几个月中  心情会变好
feel an elevation in mood in the spring and summer months
因为阳光越来越多
because of the amount of sunlight they're getting
相对于冬季而言有所增加
is increased relative to the winter months.
那么  有些人可能会说
Now, some of you may be saying,
“我爱秋天  我爱冬天  ”
"I love the fall, I love the winter,"
这些多巴胺系统对光的敏感性
sensitivity to light in these dopamine systems
有很强的遗传成分
has a strong genetic component,
所以你去了世界的某些地方  
so you go to some areas of the world,
我有斯堪的纳维亚人的亲戚  
I have relatives who are Scandinavian,
在斯堪的纳维亚半岛的某些地区  
and in some areas of Scandinavia,
人们知道
people know that there's
一种季节性的情感障碍  
a kind of seasonal affective disorder,
有一种季节性的抑郁症
there's kind of a seasonal depression
人们在冬天变得更悲伤更安静  
and people get sadder and more quiescent in the winter,
出门少了
there's actually less going out,
因此  性行为较少
and therefore, there's less sexual behavior,
这样的聚会少了  
there's less partying and things of that sort,
但是其他人会说
but other people will say,
“不  在冬季  我感觉很棒
"No, during the winter months, I feel great
“而且我喜欢冬天前后的假期  ”等
"and I love the holidays around winter," et cetera,
所以有很多差异
so there's a lot of variation,
但总的来说  途径如下
but in general, the pathway is the following,
增加对阳光的观察  必须要注意眼睛  
increased viewing of sunlight, and it has to be to the eyes,
不是皮肤
it's not to the skin,
增加对阳光的观察
increased viewing of sunlight
增加大脑中的多巴胺水平  
increases dopamine levels in the brain,
动物和人类体内多巴胺水平升高
increased dopamine levels in animals and humans
增加这些黑色素细胞的数量
increases the amount of these melanocytes
这些产生黑色素的细胞的活性
and the activity of these melanin-producing cells,
会给皮肤和头发带来色素沉着  
which give pigmentation to the skin and hair,
间接增加
and indirectly, increase the amount
睾丸激素和雌激素
of testosterone and estrogen,
然后增加  生殖行为
and thereby, reproductive behavior,
幸福感  社交互动  
feelings of well-being, social interactions,
减少焦虑等
reductions in anxiety, et cetera,
所有这些都应该说得通
all of which should make sense
根据我们已经讨论的内容
based on what we've talked about already
在生物学方面
in terms of the biology
以及这些类固醇激素的影响
and the impact of these steroid hormones
在身心的各个方面
on various aspects of the mind and body.
那么这如何转换为一种方法呢？
So how does this translate to a protocol?
这转化为以下方法：
This translates to the protocol of,
如果你想优化睾丸激素和雌激素  
if you want to optimize testosterone and estrogen,
你需要正确地进行光观察行为  
you need to get your light-viewing behavior correct,
这不仅是为了优化你的睡眠  
it's not just about optimizing your sleep,
当然这也很重要
which is also important,
就是要让你的眼睛获得足够的光线
it's about getting sufficient amount of light in your eyes
所以你有足够的多巴胺水平
so you have sufficient levels of dopamine,
所以我之前回顾过的简单协议  
so the simple protocols for that I've reviewed before,
但这意味着要花2到10分钟
but it means getting anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes
在你的眼睛中暴露在明亮的光线下  
of bright light exposure in your eyes early in the day,
戴墨镜做这件事是不够的
it is not sufficient to do this with sunglasses
除非出于安全原因必须这样做  
unless you have to do that for safety reasons,
戴处方眼镜和隐形眼镜没关系 
it's fine to wear prescription lenses and contacts,
如果你由于任何原因无法得到阳光  
if you can't get sunlight for whatever reason,
你可以使用明亮的人造光  
you want to use bright artificial light,
但这绝对是至关重要的
but that is absolutely critical
为了定时释放皮质醇  
for timing the cortisol release properly,
将皮质醇释放限制在一天的早期  
limiting cortisol release to the early part of the day,
多巴胺的增加将促进
getting increases in dopamine that are going to promote
睾丸激素和雌激素的产生
the production of testosterone and estrogen
达到健康水平
to healthy levels,
视线行为的另一方面
the other aspect of light-viewing behavior
这是非常重要的
that's extremely important
是为了避免强光照射到你的眼睛
is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes
在半夜  
in the middle of the night,
如果你在半夜观看明亮的灯光  
if you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night,
你正在抑制多巴胺的释放  
you are suppressing dopamine release,
如果你要抑制多巴胺的释放  
if you're suppressing dopamine release,
你正在抑制睾丸激素水平
you are suppressing testosterone levels
如此之多  以至于我会觉得
so much so that I would wager
睡眠不足的主要影响
that a major effect of sleep deprivation
在减少睾丸激素和雌激素
on reducing testosterone and estrogen
不一定是因为缺乏睡眠本身  
is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per se,
而是因为通常当人们
it's because usually when people
睡眠不足  
are not getting enough sleep,
他们的眼睛光线太强
they're getting too much light in their eyes
也是在半夜
in the middle of the night as well,
对此的研究尚未完成  
a study on this has not been completed yet,
但在“细胞”和“神经元”中发表了两项研究  
but there are two studies published in "Cell" and "Neuron,"
两种Cell Press期刊  优秀期刊  
both Cell Press journals, excellent journals,
显示出用眼睛观看明亮的光
showing that viewing bright light with the eyes
在昼夜中
in the middle of the circadian night
对多巴胺有不利影响  
has a detrimental effect on dopamine,
因此对一些激素也有不利影响
and therefore has a detrimental effect
诸如睾丸激素和雌激素之类的  
on things like testosterone and estrogen,
所以你甚至不能开始谈论补品
so you can't even begin to talk about supplements
和其他优化睾丸激素的方法  
and other ways to optimize testosterone,
饮食及其对睾丸激素和雌激素的影响
diet and its effects on testosterone and estrogen
与生育力和生殖行为等
and fertility and reproductive behavior, et cetera,
除非你已经呼吸正常  
until you get your breathing right,
已经获得正确的视光行为这些东西  
until you get things like your light-viewing behavior right,
一天早晨接受明亮的光线
so bright light early in the day
或者整天接受  都很棒
and throughout the day is great,
尽可能多地看明亮的光线  最好是阳光
view as much bright light, ideally sunlight, as you can,
安全的前提下  尽你所能
as much as you safely can,
你显然不想烧伤你的视网膜
you obviously don't want to burn your retinas
或损害你的视网膜  
or damage your retinas,
所以永远不要看任何特别亮的光
so never look at any light
特别亮那种  会让你觉得很痛苦  
that's so bright it's painful to look at,
但是多让光进到你的眼睛里
but getting a lot of light in your eyes
不只是要调整你的睡眠觉醒节奏  
is not just about adjusting your sleep-wake rhythms,
这也与优化你的性类固醇激素有关
it's also about optimizing your sex steroid hormones,
并在半夜里避开强光
and avoiding bright light in the middle of the night
不只是不破坏你的睡眠  
is not just about not disrupting your sleep,
这也与优化性类固醇激素有关
it's also about optimizing the sex steroid hormones,
现在你明白了
and now that you understand
性类固醇激素的工作原理
a bit of how the sex steroid hormones work
以及它们在减轻焦虑方面有多强大
and how powerful they are for reducing anxiety
以及所有其他影响  
and all these other effects,
这应该很简单
this should be straightforward to do,
或希望它启发了你
or hopefully it's inspired you
关于你的接受光的行为
to get your light-viewing behavior
并且让你的呼吸行为变得正确
and your breathing behavior correct.
实际上  在考虑工具时  
In fact, in thinking about tools,
对于许多遭受苦难的人
for many people that are suffering
从低水平的雌激素  如果他们想要更高的水平
from low levels of estrogen if they want higher levels
或低水平的睾丸激素  如果他们想要更高的水平  
or low levels of testosterone if they want higher levels,
只是获得呼吸和视线行为  
just getting the breathing and light-viewing behavior,
这将间接支持睡眠行为  
which will indirectly support sleep behavior,
可以产生巨大而积极的影响
can be a huge and positive effect
在性类固醇激素的水平上
on levels of sex steroid hormones.
我已经可以预料到  听到这个消息  
I can already anticipate that in hearing this,
你可能想知道观看光是否会   
you might wonder whether or not viewing light
例如  将在当你想要增加雌激素时
is going to, for instance, increase your testosterone a lot
  大大增加你的睾丸激素
when in fact you want your estrogen increased,
或者当你想要增加睾丸激素时  
or it's going to increase your estrogen a lot
会大大增加雌激素
when you want your testosterone increased,
我在这里描述的一切都是针对人的  
everything I'm describing here is for people,
不管是什么染色体  性腺背景  
regardless of chromosomal or gonadal background,
所以我想要提供基本上所有这些信息
so I'm trying to basically offer all this information
一口气说完
in one swoop,
但基本上  如果你是自然有卵巢的人
but basically, if you're somebody who naturally has ovaries
并且雌激素水平比睾丸激素高  
and has higher levels of estrogen than testosterone,
然后在清晨看明亮的光线  
then viewing bright light early in the day,
由于多巴胺的作用  
because of dopamine's effects,
将促进更多的雌激素
is going to promote more estrogen
和睾丸激素的微妙增加  
and subtle increases in testosterone,
而如果你是一个开始的人
whereas if you're somebody who starts off
含有更多的睾丸激素和较低的雌激素  
with more testosterone and lower estrogen,
所以大概是拥有睾丸的人
so somebody presumably who has testes
也许你正在补充睾丸激素
or maybe you're supplementing with testosterone
通过其他来源  无论出于何种原因  
through other sources for whatever reason,
观看强光
bright-light viewing
会同时增加睾丸激素和雌激素  
is going to increase testosterone and estrogen in parallel,
但是你仍然要保持
but you're still going to maintain
睾丸激素与雌激素的比例  
the ratio of testosterone to estrogen,
简而言之  你不必担心
in short, you don't have to worry
你会增加错误的荷尔蒙  
that you're going to increase the wrong hormone,
这都是关于优化荷尔蒙的比例
this is all about optimizing the ratios of hormones
你已经有
that you already have.
好吧  所以我们谈到了呼吸
Okay, so we've talked about breathing,
我们谈论光  
we've talked about light,
让我们谈谈第三个要素
let's talk about a third element
最近似乎风有些大
that there seems to be some excitement about lately
由于其他原因
for other reasons
但这实际上可以有
but that can actually have
对激素水平有一些非常深远的影响  
some pretty profound influences on hormone levels,
那就是热和冷  
and that's heat and cold,
因此  一如既往  不仅仅是提供工具  
so as always, rather than just offer a tool,
我要告诉你基础科学
I'm going to tell you the underlying science
与自然现象有关
as it relates to naturally occurring phenomena
因为  在了解到
because, in understanding that
并了解其机制  
and understanding the mechanism,
你会处于一个更好的位置
you're going to be in a far better position
了解工具和机制
to understand the tools and mechanisms
以及你可能希望如何针对自己的生活进行调整
and how you might want to adjust them for your own life.
所以现在你了解了这种
So now you understand the relationship
在光  日长  多巴胺和激素水平之间的关系 
between light, day length, dopamine, and hormone levels,
每个人都应该意识到
and everyone should realize
温度和一天的长度是相关的  
that temperature and day length are linked,
我可以肯定地说
and I'm sure as I say that,
你可能在想  “哦  当然了”
you're probably thinking, "Oh, of course."
在夏天  当阳光多时  
In summer, when there's more sunlight,
日子越长  夜晚越短  
days are longer, nights are shorter,
通常  它趋向于变暖  
in general, it tends to be warmer out,
在冬天  夜晚更长  白天更短  
and in winter, when nights are longer, days are shorter,
它往往会变冷  
it tends to be colder out,
在冬季  
and in the winter months,
睾丸激素和雌激素往往较低
testosterone and estrogen tend to be lower
在许多动物和人类中  
in many animals and in humans,
在夏季  
and in the summer months,
因为多巴胺的作用
because of the role of dopamine
在促进性类固醇激素方面  
in promoting the sex steroid hormones,
当日子更长  天气变暖时  
when days are longer and it's warmer,
人类倾向于产生更多的雌激素和睾丸激素
humans tend to make more estrogen and testosterone
相对于一年中的其他月份
relative to the other months of the year.
那么  这些效果可能会有些微弱并且可以调节
Now, these effects can be somewhat weak and modulated
不同于季节性繁殖的动物
as opposed to in seasonally breeding animals
它们真的差别很大  好吗？
where they're really dramatic, okay?
但关键是温度
But the point is that temperature
以及日照和日照  
and day length and sunlight,
这些都息息相关
those are all intimately related
因为我们发展了系统  对吗？
because of the systems that we evolved in, right?
所以在我们使用人造光之前
So before we had artificial light
以及人工加热和人工冷却  
and artificial heating and artificial cooling,
我们的生物学是在系统下进化的
our biology evolved under systems
温度  日长和激素
where temperature, day length, and the hormones
相互关联  
were correlated with one another,
因此  如今  人们对使用感冒很感兴趣
so nowadays, there's a lot of interest in using cold
作为刺激睾丸激素的一种方式
as a way to stimulate testosterone,
这主要是因为在体育界  
this is mainly because in the sports community,
特别是在健美界  
in particular, in the bodybuilding community,
他们一直在寻找方法
they are always seeking ways
最大化睾丸激素  二氢睾丸激素
to maximize testosterone, dihydrotestosterone,
保持最低水平的雌激素
keep estrogen to its minimum required
仍然有性欲和皮肤弹性
to still have a libido and still have skin elasticity
而且身体还包着保鲜膜走来走去
but also walk around with Saran-wrap skin,
然后那个行业发生的所有这种极端的事情
then all this kind of extreme stuff that happens there
导致了最近的运动  不管你信不信  
has led to a recent movement where, believe it or not,
我听到了  我简直不敢相信  我去查了一下  
I heard this and I couldn't believe it, I went and checked,
但是我没有买  
but although I didn't buy them,
在亚马逊上  你实际上可以找到  
that on Amazon, you can actually find,
他们真的是生产了有冰袋的内衣  
they're literally underwear that have ice packs,
所以我认为它们是冰袋内衣  
so I think they are ice pack underwear,
这样人们就变得很冷
so that people are making themselves cold
在性腺的水平
at the level of the gonads
为了尝试增加睾丸激素和性欲  
in order to try and increase testosterone and libido,
听起来很疯狂
sounds pretty crazy,
但信不信由你
but believe it or not,
那和冰浴和冷水淋浴之类的东西
that and things like ice baths and cold showers
对性类固醇激素有积极作用  
can have positive effects on the sex steroid hormones,
睾丸激素  主要是男性  
both testosterone, mainly in males,
和雌激素  主要是女性
and estrogen, mainly in females,
你可能会说：“等等  我觉得很冷
and you might say, "Wait, I thought cold
使生殖轴有点关闭
"makes the reproductive axis kind of shut down a bit
或减少睾丸激素和雌激素”
"or reduces testosterone and estrogen,"
但事实证明  这实际上不是“冰冷感”
but it turns out it's not actually the cold
在人们身上产生了这些影响  
that's having these effects in people,
诸如冰浴  冷水淋浴  冷水游泳  
things like the ice bath, cold showers, cold-water swims,
这些冰内衣或其他东西  
these ice underwear or whatever they are,
不能相信居然有这些  但是它们确实存在  
can't believe that these actually exist, but they do exist,
发生的事情是血管舒张反弹
what happens is there's a rebound in vasodilation
冷却后  所以冷却会引起血管收缩  
after cooling, so cooling causes vasoconstriction,
然后在冷却后  出现了反弹性血管舒张
and then after the cooling, there's a rebound vasodilation
而且性腺中有更多的血液注入
and there's more infusion of blood into the gonads.
还有一种神经性的效果  
There's also an effect that's neural,
所以让我解释一下这是如何工作的
so let me explain how this works
因为对此只有很少的研究  
because there are only a few studies on this,
没有一个人看着冰冻的内衣  
none of which looking at the frozen underwear,
但是看了冷暴露
but that have looked at cold exposure
和雄激素和雌激素的水平  
and levels of androgens and estrogens,
这很有意思  
and it's kind of interesting,
所以你要记住性腺  
so you have to remember that the gonad,
卵巢和睾丸  它们都大量血管化
the ovaries and the testes are heavily vascularized.
记住  即使在大脑的水平  
Remember, even at the level of the brain,
GnRH  促性腺激素释放激素  
GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
来自神经元
comes from neurons that, believe it or not,
在发育初期就从你的鼻子开始  
start off in your nose early in development,
移入下丘脑
migrate into the hypothalamus.
我没有瞎说  它们从你的鼻子开始
I'm not making that up, they started off in your nose
并迁移到下丘脑
and migrated to the hypothalamus.
这些神经元扩展了过程  我们称它们为轴突  
Those neurons extend processes, we call them axons,
进入垂体并释放GnRH到垂体中
into the pituitary and release GnRH into the pituitary.
垂体内部有很多血管形成  
There's a lot of vascularization within the pituitary,
所以现在这些激素或GnRH  
so now those hormones, or GnRH,
可以刺激促卵泡激素
can stimulate follicle-stimulating hormone,
黄体生成素
luteinizing hormone,
然后释放出来并进入血液
which then are released and travel into the bloodstream.
然后这些激素到达卵巢或睾丸  
Then those hormones reach the ovary or testes,
它们必须进入卵巢和睾丸  
and they have to get into the ovary and testes,
它们这样做的方式是通过血管系统  
and the way they do that is through the vascular system,
人们都忘了  但是血管系统
and people forget, but the vascular system
以及血管收缩或扩张的程度
and how constricted or dilated vessels are
是由神经元控制的  好吗？
is controlled by neurons, all right?
我们在关于压力的讨论中讨论了这一点
We discussed this during the discussion about stress
在压力那期中
in the stress episode,
但这是神经科学家众所周知的
but it's well-known to neuroscientists
关闭神经元的最佳方法是冷却神经元  
that the best way to shut down neurons is to cool them,
所以有很多这样的例子
so there are a lot of examples of this
在科学文献中  
in the scientific literature,
但是大多数人都不知道
but most people aren't aware of it
因为你不会在这些论文的方法部分  
because you're not digging around
一直看啊看
in the method section of these papers,
但是当我们想关闭神经元时  
but when we want to shut down neurons,
我们可以做诸如注射药物之类的事情  
we can do things like inject drugs that will do that,
就像利多卡因  让你麻木的东西
like lidocaine, you know, the stuff that makes you numb
在牙医那里  
at the dentist,
或者你可以使用其他抑制剂  
or you can use different inhibitors,
但是实验性地做的最好方法之一
but one of the best ways to do it experimentally
其实就是冷却神经元  
is to just cool neurons,
当你使神经元发冷时  
when you make neurons cold,
因为有温度依赖性
because there's a temperature dependence
什么时候神经元可以活跃  什么时候不活跃  
of when neurons can be active and when they can't,
神经元关闭
the neurons shut down,
所以  为什么冷暴露
so the most plausible explanation for why cold exposure,
比如1到10分钟的冰浴或冷水淋浴
either through 1 to 10-minute ice bath or cold shower
或冰内裤的东西  
or the ice underpants thing,
会增加睾丸激素或增加雌激素  这个最合理的解释
would increase testosterone or increase estrogen
就是你在冷却神经元
is that you're cooling the neurons
控制血管收缩和血管舒张
that control vasoconstriction and vasodilation
并阻止血液的进入  
and shutting down the entry of blood,
或至少减少它  
or at least reducing it,
和激素进入性腺  
and hormones into the gonad,
然后当性腺和周围区域
and then when the gonad and the surrounding area
再次变热
heats up again,
你会出现反弹性过度血管舒张
you're getting a rebound hyper-vasodilation
提供了过多而不是过多的
that delivers excessive levels of, not excessive,
但GnRH和其他激素水平升高
but increased levels of GnRH and other hormones
以及载体和载体蛋白等
and carriers and carrier proteins and so forth
然后会刺激性腺
that would then stimulate the gonad
释放更多的睾丸激素
to release more testosterone
或会刺激性腺释放更多的雌激素  
or would stimulate the gonad to release more estrogen,
这是我可以提出的最合理的解释  
that's the most plausible explanation I can come up with,
没有很多研究
there aren't a lot of studies
看温度对性腺的直接影响  
looking at direct effects of temperature on the gonad,
这将是一项艰巨的研究
and it's going to be a difficult study to carry out
在任何情况下  因为除非是在培养皿中体外进行  
in any case because unless it were done in vitro in a dish,
消除所有其他事情非常困难
it's very hard to eliminate all the other things
像血管收缩和血管扩张  
like vasoconstriction and vasodilation,
简而言之  我们不知道是否冷热
put simply, we don't know whether or not cold and heat
直接影响睾丸激素和雌激素的产生  
directly affect the production of testosterone and estrogen,
我们只知道冷热会调节这些  
we only know that cold and heat can modulate those,
可能是通过间接机制
probably through indirect mechanisms
像控制血流量一样
like controlling the amount of blood flow
通过关闭或激活神经元
by way of shutting down or activating the neurons.
现在有很多知识
Now, there's a lot of lore
周围的性腺加热过多  
around heating up the gonads too much,
实际上有一套
there's actually a whole set
伪科学网页上说：
of pseudoscience webpages out there saying,
“好吧  如果你想要一个女孩  
"Well, if you want a girl,
“你应该在这个室温下孕育孩子  
"you should conceive the child at this room temperature,
“如果你想要一个男孩  
"and if you want a boy,
“你应该在这个室温下孕育孩子”
"you should conceive the child at this room temperature."
我不认为真的有
I don't think there's really
任何有力的科学证据  这两个观点都没有证据
any firm scientific evidence for that, for either one,
但是有一些有趣的文学
but there's some interesting literature
关于激素产生的温度依赖性  
about temperature dependence of production of hormones,
我认为这可能与
and I think that it probably relates
这些血管舒张机制
to these mechanisms of vasodilation
以及血管扩张的神经控制  
and neural control over vasodilation,
当然  热量过高
and of course, excessively high heat
对睾丸不好
is not good for the testes,
为了生产精子或为了精子健康  
for sperm production, or for sperm health,
精子的帽子里有各种各样的蛋白质  
sperm have all sorts of proteins in the cap,
Pentraxins之类的东西和其他东西
things like pentraxins and other things
导致他们游泳更快
that cause them to swim faster
当他们在正确的位置正确表达时  
when they're expressed properly and in the right locations,
热量实际上会改变位置和功能
and heat actually alters the location and the function
其中许多蛋白质对热非常敏感  
of a lot of those proteins, they're very heat sensitive,
这就是为什么过热
and so that's why excessive heat
确实不利于生育  
is truly not good for fertility,
这可能与热的作用无关
which may be independent of heat's roles
促进雌激素或睾丸激素
in promoting estrogen or testosterone.
好的  现在我们谈论呼吸
Okay, so now we've talked about breathing,
光和温度
light, and temperature,
我们谈论了父母考虑的  谈论了竞争  
we talked about parenthood, we talked about competition,
我们讨论了一些信息素的作用  
and we talked about some pheromone effects,
现在让我们谈谈特定形式的运动
now let's talk about particular forms of exercise
以及它们如何调节类固醇激素  
and how they modulate the steroid hormones,
然后我们将讨论各种补品  
and then we're going to talk about various supplements,
两者都涉及睾丸激素
both in reference to testosterone
以及雌激素
and in reference to estrogen.
因此  现在让我们谈谈如何以各种形式进行锻炼  
So now let's talk about how exercise in its various forms,
体重训练  耐力工作  
weight training, endurance work,
进行重量训练直至失败  或进行较少强度的重量训练
weight training to failure, or less intense weight training
会影响睾丸激素水平
can impact testosterone levels,
但我想提醒你  我们在谈论睾丸激素
but I want to remind you that we're talking about testosterone
无论是男性还是女性  都是适用的
both in males and females,
并根据你从该集的开头了解到的信息  
and based on what you know from earlier in the episode,
睾丸激素可以有很多积极的作用
testosterone can have numerous positive effects
男性和女性都想让他们的睾丸激素都处于最佳范围内
in both males and females provided they're in optimal range.
因此  如果你浏览网络  
So if you look on the web,
人们会说：“哦  你知道  
people will say, "Oh, you know,
“重量训练可增加睾丸激素  
"testosterone is increased by weight training,
“这些大而重的复合运动  ”
"you want to do these big, heavy compound movements,"
深蹲  硬拉之类的训练
squats and deadlifts and chins and things of that sort,
但是科学研究呢？
but what about the scientific studies?
像这样的实际依据是什么？
Like, what's the actual basis for this?
因为如果你退后一步
Because if you just take a step back
从科学家的角度来看这个
and look at this from the perspective of a scientist,
你会说  好吧  深蹲是什么？
you'd say, okay, what is a squat?
蹲在杠铃上举起一堆重物
A squat is loading up a bunch of weights on a bar
然后  你知道  本质上就是坐下来  
and then, you know, sitting down, essentially,
并一遍又一遍地站起来
and standing up over and over again.
什么是硬拉？
What's a deadlift?
它正在从地面举起沉重的重物
It's lifting heavy weights from the ground.
为什么会增加睾丸激素  对吗？
Why would that increase testosterone, right?
这是举重训练中通常没有讨论的内容
This is what's often not discussed in the weight training
甚至运动科学界  
or even the exercise science community,
什么会真正刺激睾丸激素的释放
what would actually stimulate the release of testosterone
从肾上腺和/或睾丸开始  
from the adrenals and/or testes,
肾上腺或睾丸或两者兼而有之？
and which one is it, adrenals or testes or both?
而且通常没有讨论过  
And that's often not discussed,
但是作为神经科学家  
but as a neuroscientist,
这些是我们思考的事情
these are the kinds of things we think about
因为我们一直认为基因不会创造行为  
because we think always that genes don't create behavior,
免疫系统自己不知道何时被激活  
immune systems don't know when to be activated,
肺部自己不知道何时应该吸气或呼气  
lungs don't know when to inhale or exhale,
心脏自己不知道何时该跳动
hearts don't know when to beat
除了从神经元获得的信息之外  
except for the information that it gets from neurons,
神经系统控制着所有这些  
the nervous system controls all of that,
所以实际上答案必须在神经系统中
and so really the answer has to be in the neural system
与这些特定类型的
that's related to these particular types
负重锻炼有关
of weight-bearing exercises.
因此  当你阅读这些文献时  
So when you go into this literature,
很难找到真正的机制  
it's kind of hard to find real mechanism,
你会看到很多影响  
you see a lot of effects,
你会听到诸如雄激素受体含量之类的信息  
you'll hear things like, androgen receptor content,
意思是睾丸激素及其衍生物  
meaning testosterone and its derivatives,
高强度运动后的受体含量
receptor content following heavy-resistance exercise,
你会发现一些例子
and you'll find some examples
例如  他们做肌肉活检  
that, for instance, you know, they do muscle biopsies,
他们实际上可以看到受体增加  
they can actually see receptor increases,
看着大批量
looking at either high-volume
或少量的非常激烈的运动  
or low-volume really intense exercise,
你可以找到很多  但没有很多机制
and you can find a lot of that but not a lot of mechanism
关于神经系统将如何做到这一点  
about how the nervous system would do this,
以及你想知道如何做到的原因
and the reason you'd want to know how it can do it
是你可能会建立更好的协议
is that you could potentially build better protocols
或弄清楚这些动作到底是怎么回事
or figure out exactly what about these movements
引发增长
is triggering increases
在雄激素受体和睾丸激素
in androgen receptors and testosterone.
所以有趣的是  当你开始挖掘
So what's interesting is when you start digging
进入关于机制的研究时
into the more mechanistic studies,
你发现的是重量训练  
what you find is that heavy weight training,
所以这是重量训练
so this is weight training where the sets
可以完成1到8次(rep)范围内的任何动作
are done with anywhere from kind of one to eight rep range,
这会转变成不同的
and this translates differently
根据肌纤维类型的比例等等  
depending on ratio of muscle fiber type and so forth,
但基本上人
but where basically people are
可以在其最大重量的70％到95％之间做这个动作 
working at anywhere from like, 70% to 95% of their maximum,
甚至有时
or sometimes even going
一直到他们的一遍重复最高
right down to their one-repetition maximum,
真的是最大的重量
really kind of max effort,
你发现的是使用神经系统
what you find is that using the nervous system
以他们搬运重物的方式
in a way in which they're moving heavy loads,
这样我就说
so that I would translate to recruitment
高阈值电机单元
of high-threshold motor units,
对你的肌肉生理学家来说  
for you muscle physiologists,
肌肉生理学有一个规律
and there's a rule in muscle physiology
关于运动肌肉的神经元募集
about the neuron recruitment for moving muscles
你基本上在哪里使用
where you basically use
神经元运动单位的最小数量
the minimum number of motor units of neurons
尽可能地激活肌肉  
to activate muscle as you possibly can,
随着负载的增加  你必须招募
as loads increase, you have to recruit
越来越多的神经元  
more and more neurons,
你总是会听到有关募集肌纤维的信息  
you always hear about recruiting muscle fibers,
但实际上  它正在招募更多的神经元
but really, it's recruiting more neurons
调动更多的肌纤维  
to recruit more muscle fibers,
而你会发现  重量训练  
and what you find is that heavy weight training,
但也不是做不动的重量训练
but not weight training to failure
在不可能完成重复的地方  
where completion of a repetition is impossible,
导致最大的睾丸激素增加
leads to the greatest increases in testosterone.
那么  我确定有一堆
Now, I'm sure there are a bunch
健身爱好者
of exercise jockeys out there
举一堆例子来找我
that are going to come at me with a bunch of things
哦  我想要让肌肉变大
where, oh, yeah, but high volume and this,
训练失败  当然  
and training to failure and that, sure,
如果你愿意将各种东西放在一起  
if you're willing to kind of put things side by side,
调整外源性睾丸激素治疗
adjust for exogenous testosterone treatment
还有很多其他的  
and all the rest,
在这些研究中完成的
which was done in these studies,
你发现的一般情况
what you find in general
负重训练
is that weight training with heavy loads,
只要是一次最大重量
so anywhere from one-rep maximum
到能做六到八次重复的重量  这个范围内
to somewhere in the six to eight repetition range,
在男性或女性中  
in males or females,
这会显着增加睾丸激素  
increases testosterone significantly,
大约持续一天  有时长达48小时  
and it does it for about a day, sometimes up to 48 hours,
我发现的研究
and the studies that I found
似乎是最严谨或最重量级的一篇论文
which seem to hold the most rigor or weight
根据它们的发布平台
based on where they're published
不是什么
as opposed to being published
“从未听说过”的期刊中出版的
in the journal of "Never Heard of It,"
他们在高质量
they're published in good-quality
运动生理学期刊中出版
exercise physiology journals,
例如Ratamess的论文  
for instance, the paper by Ratamess,
RATAMESS等  
R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,
于2005年出版  
which was published in 2005,
讨论雄激素受体含量的调节
which talks about modulations in androgen receptor content
经过剧烈的阻抗运动后  
after heavy resistance exercise,
也就是可能冲不上去的那组
looks at going to failure and not to failure,
Izquierdo等人的工作于2006年出版  
the work of Izquierdo et al. published in 2006,
“力量训练的不同效果
"Differential Effects of Strength Training
导致运动失败与否
"Leading to Failure Versus Not Failure
这时荷尔蒙反应  力量和力量获得”  
"on Hormonal Responses, Strength, and Power Gains,"
你知道  这里有很多研究
you know, there are a lot of studies here
我当然会将这些链接放在标题中  
and I will certainly put the links to these in the caption,
其中许多实际上包括Duncan French  
many of these actually include Duncan French,
他经营着UFC培训中心
who runs the UFC training center
我有幸见到过
who I've had the privilege of meeting
并与他讨论了其中的一些  
and discussing some of this with before,
当然还有其他作者
as well as other authors, of course,
但他们都指出了事实
but they all point to the fact
关于神经元的参与
that there's something about the engagement of the neurons
在肌肉中募集高阈值的运动单位
that recruit high-threshold motor units in muscle
当举重 并且成功举起时  
when moving heavy loads, but not to failure,
必须提供某种反馈信号  
that has to provide some sort of feedback signal,
要么性腺产生更多的睾丸激素  
either to the gonad to produce more testosterone,
或正在增加体内受体的活性
or is increasing the activity of receptors in the body.
那么  为什么要这样说呢？
Now, why do I say that?
好吧  这是难题  对不对？
Well, this is the puzzle, right?
一个特定的动作如何  
How is it that a particular movement,
就像和孩子互动一样  
just like how is it that interacting with your child,
让它增加或者减少睾丸激素？
is increasing or decreasing testosterone?
这是一种基本的问题
This is the kind of fundamental question
在机制方面  
at the mechanistic level,
我们回答了孕育孩子的问题  
and we answered the question for child-rearing,
可能与气味和信息素有关  
it has probably something to do with smell and pheromones,
尽管我敢肯定还有其他刺激  
although I'm sure there are other cues as well,
但显然有影响
but there's clearly a influence
在神经层次上的积极参与
of hard work at the neural level
然后在肌肉水平增加睾丸激素  
and then at the muscular level for increasing testosterone,
而且显然还有其他的参与
and there's also clearly an effect of working too hard
并且大概增加了皮质醇  
and presumably increasing cortisol too much,
尽管我在推测
although I'm speculating there,
在减少睾丸激素方面  
in terms of reducing testosterone,
所以我们对此变得越来越具体的原因
and so the reason we're getting nitty-gritty about this
是因为最终  我们真的很想了解  
is because ultimately, we'd really like to understand,
最佳协议是什么？
what are the optimal protocols?
你知道  在文献中  
You know, out there in the literature,
你会听到  举重以增加睾丸激素  
you hear, move heavy objects to increase testosterone,
其中一些将被转换
some of that will be converted
到更强大的雄激素DHT  
to the more powerful androgen, DHT,
通过5-α还原酶等
by 5-alpha reductase et cetera,
但是我们真的还不明白
but we really don't understand yet
这些特殊行为如何增加睾丸激素
how these particular behaviors increase testosterone
以及它是否正在这样做
and whether or not it's doing that
通过调节受体
by modulating the receptors
或者直接调节睾丸激素的释放  
or it's modulating testosterone release directly,
大概是睾丸激素直接释放
presumably, testosterone release directly
感受器的敏感性
and sensitivity of the receptors,
大多数肌肉生理学研究
that what most of the muscle physiology studies
我能够找到指向
that I was able to find point to,
但这基本上可以归结为
but this basically boils down
特定的方法
to a particular set of protocols
如果你想增加睾丸激素  
where if you want to increase testosterone,
不管出于什么原因
for whatever reason,
成功做完一组最大负重训练
that weight training with heavy loads but not to failure
似乎是最受支持的
seems to be the best-supported,
至少得到科学上的支持  对此的解决方案  
at least scientifically supported, solution to that,
那么  它可能不会让你随心所欲地
now, it may not raise your testosterone levels
提高你的睾丸激素水平
as high as you want,
但这绝对是朝正确的方向发展
but it's definitely taking things in the correct direction.
那么  你们中许多人可能是耐力运动员
Now, many of you might be endurance athletes
或也喜欢运动
or also enjoy exercise
除了负重运动  
besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,
有几项研究
and there are several studies
探索是否有耐力活动
exploring whether or not endurance activity
可以增加或减少雄激素水平
can increase or decrease androgen levels
以及你合并
and whether or not you combine
耐力运动和体重训练  
endurance activity and weight training,
你是先做耐力运动   这种顺序
whether or not that has any effect
是否有相应的效果
if you do the endurance activity first or second,
而这一切的收获
and the takeaway from all of this
如果是先进行耐力活动  
was that endurance activity, if performed first,
导致睾丸激素减少
leads to decreases in testosterone
在举重训练中
during the weight training session
与首先进行的同一重量训练相比
as compared to the same weight training session done first
然后是耐力运动
followed by endurance activity,
换句话说  如果你想优化睾丸激素水平  
in other words, if you want to optimize testosterone levels,
似乎是首先进行重量训练
it seems to be the case that weight training first
然后进行心脏型耐力运动
and doing cardio-type endurance activity afterward
是正确的业务顺序
is the right order of business.
那么  当这些分别完成后  
Now, when these are done on separate days,
它似乎没有效果  
it doesn't seem to have an effect,
没有统计上的结果 
they showed no statistical interaction,
但似乎如果你要执行这些操作
but it seems that if you're going to do these
在同一场锻炼中
in the same workout episode
首先做重量训练
that it's move heavy loads first,
然后做心肺运动  
then do cardiovascular exercise,
所以有一点数据
so there's a little bit of data
专门研究耐力运动
looking specifically at how endurance exercise
如何影响睾丸激素及其衍生物  
impacts testosterone and its derivatives,
很明显  高强度间歇训练
and it's very clear that high-intensity interval training,
短跑等等
sprinting et cetera,
有点模仿神经活动
which somewhat mimics the neural activity
在举重时发生的情况
that occurs while moving heavy weight loads,
将增加睾丸激素
is going to increase testosterone
文献中有足够的证据
and there's ample evidence for that in the literature,
耐力运动超过75分钟
and that endurance exercise that extends beyond 75 minutes
将开始导致睾丸激素减少  
is going to start to lead to reductions in testosterone,
大概是由于皮质醇的增加  
presumably by increases in cortisol,
但是当然  运动的强度
but of course, the intensity of the exercise
也很重要
is going to be important too,
你知道  我认为没有人真正相信
you know, I don't think anyone really believes
徒步三个小时
that hiking for three hours
将减少你的睾丸激素  
is going to reduce your testosterone,
而我认为如果有人要出去
whereas I think if one were to go out
努力跑三个小时
and run hard for three hours
你可以想象睾丸激素会减少
that you can imagine there'd be reductions in testosterone
通过增加皮质醇  
by way of increases in cortisol,
因此  尽管这一领域当然需要更多的研究  
and so while this area certainly needs more research,
很明显  限制耐力运动
it's pretty clear that limiting the endurance exercise
到75分钟或更短的时间  不要太紧张  
to 75 minutes or less, not making it too intense,
是阻止皮质醇升高的一种方法  
is one way to keep cortisol from going through the roof,
但我在以前的播客中已经谈过
but I've talked on previous episodes,
还有很多其他人在说
and there are a lot of others who have talked out there
关于如何夹持皮质醇  
about how to clamp cortisol,
如何使皮质醇进一步降低  
how to keep cortisol more reduced,
这也是你可以想象的原因之一
this is also one of the reasons why, you can imagine,
每个人都有差异
that various individuals,
出于竞争或仅出于自己的目的  
either for competition or just for their own purposes,
依靠睾丸激素疗法  外源性睾丸激素  
rely on testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone,
不仅用于体重训练  还用于耐力锻炼  
not just for weight training, but for endurance exercise,
因此  这就是为什么每隔一段时间会出现一些新闻的原因之一  
so this is one of the reasons why every once in a while,
就是专业的自行车手会被爆出
professional cyclists will get popped
使用提高运动表现的药物  
for performance-enhancing drugs,
也就是他们被抓到使用违禁药物  
meaning they'll get caught,
不只是它们增加了红血球
and it's not just that they're increasing red blood cells
通过EPO和类似的东西  
through EPO and things of that sort,
通常他们也服用睾丸激素
oftentimes they're also taking testosterone
不是因为他们想让肌肉变大
not because they want to be large
或有肥大的肌肉  
or have massively hypertrophied muscles,
但是因为他们正在注射睾丸激素  
but because they're injecting testosterone,
然后他们就不必担心
they don't have to worry
皮质醇引起的睾丸激素减少  
about cortisol-induced reductions in testosterone,
他们可以一直保持住
and they can just clamp,
保持高水平睾丸激素
or keep their testosterone levels high,
我不推荐
not something I'm recommending,
但我只是在说明他们这么做的理由
but I'm just justifying the rationale
一个耐力运动员从根本上  为什么想这样做
for why an endurance athlete would want to do that at all.
所以现在让我们转到谈论雌激素  
So now let's switch over to talking about estrogen,
所以有很多人
so there are many people
正在努力优化自己的雌激素水平  
who are trying to optimize their estrogen levels,
也是经常被问到的一个事情
and one of the places where this shows up a lot
我收到了很多关于更年期的问题  
and I get a lot of questions about is menopause,
就像我前面提到的那样  更年期
so menopause, as I mentioned earlier,
血液循环中雌激素的数量
is this fairly massive reduction in the amount of estrogen
减少了
that is circulating in one's blood
主要是因为卵巢
mainly because the ovary
开始消耗了一些自身的雌激素
is now depleted of some estrogen production of its own,
卵子不被生产  
the eggs are not being produced,
已经被耗尽  等等
they've been depleted, et cetera.
因此  更年期的特征是多种症状  
So menopause is characterized by a variety of symptoms,
而且它是多方面的  
and it's multifaceted,
可能值得一整集  
probably deserves an entire episode on its own,
但是像潮热  情绪波动之类的东西  
but things like hot flashes, things like mood swings,
头痛  尤其是偏头痛  
things like headaches, in particular migraine headaches,
可能会有很多脑雾  
there can be a lot of brain fog,
对人们而言  这可能是非常非常具有破坏性的
it can be very, very disruptive for people.
那么  你有时会听到关于更年期的信息  
Now, you sometimes hear about andropause,
被认为是更年期的类似物  
which is thought to be the kind of analog to menopause,
但是更年期有一定的特点
but menopause has certain characteristics
对大多数女性来说  这是一个非常稳定的现象  
that make it a very robust phenomenon for most women,
而对于男人  
whereas for men,
更年期有时会发生  有时不会发生  
andropause is going to sometimes happen, sometimes won't,
实际上  无需赘述
in fact, without going into the details
图和数据
of the graphs and the data,
正如我前面提到的  这非常清楚  
it's very clear, as I mentioned earlier,
一些男人维持体内雄激素水平
that some men maintain levels of circulating androgens
很高
that are quite high,
甚至和青春期一样
even as similar as they were in puberty
他们20岁以下的青少年时期  
and their teen years and 20s,
到60岁  70  80岁  保持比较稳定的水平
well into their 60s, 70s, and 80s
如果他们正在优化很多其他事情  
if they're optimizing a lot of other things,
也许遗传学也起着作用  
and probably genetics plays a role as well,
而有些男性则不会
whereas some males won't,
但在女性人口中  
but within the female population,
或有卵巢的个体的人口  
or population of individuals that have ovaries,
有一个非常刻板和特色
there's a very stereotyped and characteristic
就是随着卵子数量的减少  
reduction in estrogen levels
雌激素水平降低
as the number of eggs becomes depleted,
这就是我们所认为的更年期
and that's what we think of as menopause.
那有没有什么办法
So what are the various things
让女性用来应对更年期
that one can do for menopause?
好吧  最常见的一种
Well, one of the most common ones
是医师会开出补充雌激素的处方  
is that physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen,
所以这是激素疗法
so this is hormone therapy
有人服用口服雌激素
where somebody takes either their oral estrogen
或者他们会使用补丁或小球  
or they'll use a patch or a pellet,
将雌二醇分泌到系统中的某种方法  
some way to secrete estradiol into the system,
根据个人的不同  成功的程度也各不相同  
and that has varying success depending on the individual,
有些人对此反应很好  
some people respond very well to it,
有的人有些困难
other people really have challenges with it,
而且有很多副作用
and there are a lot of side effects associated with it
对于某些人  而不是其他人  
for some people, not others,
另外  总有一个顾虑
in addition, there's a concern always
关于补充雌激素
about supplementing estrogen
当家里有乳腺癌的背景时
when there's a breast cancer background in the family
或出于任何原因担心乳腺癌
or there's concern about breast cancer for any reason
因为这些癌症中有很多是雌激素依赖性的  
because a lot of those cancers are estrogen-dependent,
这就是为什么他莫昔芬和阿那曲唑等药物的原因
and that's why drugs like tamoxifen and anastrozole
以及能阻止任何芳香化酶的药物
and drugs that block either aromatase
或直接封锁  请原谅我  雌激素受体
or block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly
是最初开发的
were initially developed,
你在互联网上经常看到他们  
you see them a lot on the internet,
再次  对于所有体育人士
again, for all the sports folks
谁试图增加睾丸激素  减少雌激素  
who are trying to increase testosterone, reduce estrogen,
但请记住  这些药物最初是开发出来的
but remember, those drugs were initially developed
作为防止雌激素与雌激素受体结合的方法
as ways to prevent estrogen binding to the estrogen receptor
作为癌症的治疗方法
as cancer treatments,
所以我想很清楚
so I want to be very clear
我已经说了很多遍了
and I've said this many times,
当然  我们总是将其放在每集的标题中
we always put it in the caption of each episode, of course,
我不是医师  我不是医学博士  
that I'm not a physician, I'm not an M.D.,
我什么都没订
I don't prescribe anything,
我是教授  我自称东西  
I'm a professor and I profess things,
我是来翻译科学文献的
I'm here to translate the scientific literature
并指出可能是什么
and point to what might be
一些有用的探索途径
some useful avenues for exploration,
但这只是出于信息目的  
but this is just for information purposes,
你一定要和你的医生谈谈
you should definitely talk to your doctor
关于我现在正在谈论的任何事情
about anything that I'm talking about now
或任何播客
or in any episode, for that matter.
因此  如果你看一下有关更年期的文献
So if you look at the literature on menopause
除了标准的雌激素疗法外  
outside of just standard estrogen therapy,
有一些非常有趣的化合物
there are some very interesting compounds out there
已经使用过的
that have been used
并得到了高质量的同行评审研究的支持  
and that are supported by quality peer-reviewed studies,
再一次  我会再次推荐你
and again, I'll refer you once again
到这个了不起的网站inspect.com  
to this amazing website, examine.com,
基本上可以放在任何条件下
where you can put in essentially any condition
或任何补充  
or any supplement,
它将指出你的人为作用矩阵  
and it will point you to the human effect matrix,
不是动物研究  
not animal studies,
但是人类研究已经探索了这些东西
but human studies that have explored these things.
那么  这里有各种各样的东西
Now, there are a huge variety of them here
所以我不会去研究所有的人
so I won't go into all of them,
但是一些促雌激素化合物
but some of the pro-estrogenic compounds
被证明是强大的
that have been shown to be powerful
在更年期的背景下  
in the context of menopause,
以及其他条件
as well as other conditions
雌激素低于人们想要的水平
where estrogen is lower than one would like,
在一些文献中包含描述  
include a description in some of the literature,
一会儿  我会讲到这一点  
I'll get into this in a moment,
像黑升麻一样
of something like black cohosh,
我认为那是正确的发音  
I think that's the correct pronunciation,
字面上是黑色  然后是COHOSH  
it's literally the word black and then C-O-H-O-S-H,
这很有趣
and it's very interesting,
有13个经过同行评审的研究
there are 13 peer-reviewed studies
已经突出
that have reached prominence
在那种商业景观中
in the kind of commercial landscape
这种物质  黑升麻  
where this substance, black cohosh,
已经被推广为增加雌激素的一种方法  
has been promoted as a way to increase estrogen,
原来效果是一致的
turns out that the effects are consistent
但是还很小
but are fairly minor,
雌激素的增加很小
fairly minor increases in estrogen,
所以这确实是一个真实的效果  
so it does seem to be a real effect,
它对安慰剂的作用很重要  
it is significant over the placebo effect,
但还有明显的安慰剂作用
but there's also a significant placebo effect
在其中一些研究中  
in some of these studies as well,
所以当你看这些研究时有趣的是
so what's interesting when you look at these studies
是其中许多被执行了吗
is that many of them were carried out
在六个多月的时间里  
over a period of six-plus months,
他们是双盲研究  等等
they're double-blind studies, et cetera,
几乎所有这些都会导致雌激素的适度增加
and almost all of them lead to modest increases in estrogen
更年期相关症状的减轻
and modest decreases in menopause-related symptoms.
那么  有关这些研究的一些其他细节  
Now, a few additional details about these studies,
通常是针对45至64岁的女性进行的  
they were generally carried out on women age 45 to 64,
在某些情况下  他们专门针对女性
in some cases, they look specifically at women
临床上肥胖或超重的人  
that were clinically obese or overweight,
尽管并非总是如此  
although not always,
主题大小池很大  
the subject size pools are pretty big,
你知道  从50到87  
you know, anywhere from 50 to 87,
这些是体面的大小  有132个主题  等等
these are decent size,
132 subjects, et cetera,
所以这些看起来像是质量研究  
so these look to be like quality studies,
他们基本上指出了黑升麻的事实
and they basically point to the fact that black cohosh
对改善更年期症状可能有适度的作用
can have a modest effect in improving menopause symptoms.
另一个是人参
The other one is Panax ginseng,
所以PNAAX人参  
so P-N-A-A-X ginseng,
已经显示出可以减轻某些症状
has been shown to decrease some symptoms
与绝经有关  主要与性欲有关  
associated with menopause, mostly related to libido,
尽管其他效果不可靠
although the other effects were unreliable.
其他东西  例如玛咖  
Other things, like maca,
已知它实际上会增加多巴胺  
which is known to increase dopamine actually,
有轻微的影响  
had minor effects,
像这样的名字
things like, the names here
有点难以发音  所以请原谅我  
are a little hard to pronounce, so forgive me,
像缬草
things like Valeriana officinalis
表明可以有所改善
has shown that there can be some improvement
在潮热症状
in the hot flash symptoms
以及与此相关的一些失眠  
and some of the insomnia associated with that,
因此可能值得探索  
so that might be worth exploring,
再次与你的医生讨论  
again, discuss with your doctor,
但都是100分以上
but these were both 100-subject plus,
45至64岁的人  
age 45 to 64 individuals,
双盲安慰剂对照研究
double-blind placebo-controlled studies
表现出显着但适度的效果
that showed significant but modest effects.
只有一种物质
There was one substance
在看过的化合物的画廊中
in the gallery of the compounds that was looked at
事实证明  这特别有趣  
that turns out to be particularly interesting,
而且这句话也很难发音  
and this one is also particularly difficult to pronounce,
是葛根葛根
and it's Pueraria mirifica,
所以我要为你讲清楚
so I'm going to spell this out for you,
是PUERARIA  葛根  
it's P-U-E-R-A-R-I-A, Pueraria,
mirifica  MIRIFICA  
mirifica, M-I-R-I-F-I-C-A,
对此化合物有四项研究
and there are four studies on this compound
在任何情况下都表明它非常有力  
that show, in every case, it to be very potent,
实际上  与雌激素疗法相比  
in fact, comparable to estrogen therapy,
雌激素替代疗法
estrogen replacement therapy,
在减少更年期症状方面  
in reducing the symptoms of menopause,
所以这很惊人
so this was pretty striking
因为当你完成这些研究时
because when you go through these studies
然后你再看一次
and you look again
他们似乎控制得很好  
that they seem to be pretty well controlled,
据我所知  
as far as I could tell,
他们探索了一个相当广泛的主题库  
and they explored a pretty wide subject pool,
而且似乎这些研究中的每一项  
and it seems that every single one of these studies,
当并排看葛根葛时  
when looking side by side at Pueraria mirifica,
也称为
which is also called,
那么  这真的很难发音  Kwao Krua Kao  
now this is really hard to pronounce, Kwao Krua Kao,
我猜这就是他们在各个国家/地区使用的名称  
I guess that's the name that they use in various countries,
与雌激素替代疗法相当  
that it was comparable to estrogen replacement therapy,
我之所以提到这是因为很多人都与我联系
so I mentioned this because a lot of people contacted me
并说：“更年期的失眠呢？
and said, "What about the insomnia in menopause?
“更年期的头痛呢？”
"What about the headaches in menopause?"
那么  我不建议你用光
Now, I'm not suggesting you run out
并立即开始服用这些化合物中的任何一种  
and immediately start taking any of these compounds,
请告诉你的医生  
please talk to your doctor,
你知道  任何激素相关的化合物
you know, any hormone-related compound
是一个认真的考虑
is a serious consideration
由于与乳腺癌的关系  
because of the relationship to breast cancers,
但一般来说  这些化合物是
but just in general, these compounds are,
雌激素和睾丸激素非常强大
estrogen and testosterone, are exceedingly powerful
在控制我们的精神和身体状态方面  
in terms of controlling our mental and physical states,
所以你要谨慎对待他们  
and so you want to approach them with caution,
但我认为特别有趣的是
but I thought that that one in particular was interesting
并且有很多PubMed记录在案  
and for which there are quite a few PubMed-documented,
高质量期刊中的同行评审研究
peer-reviewed studies in quality journals.
好吧  现在让我们谈谈
Okay, so now let's talk
关于特定化合物的作用  
about the role of specific compounds,
其中一些  其中许多可以采取
some of which, many of which can be taken
以补充形式或从饮食和营养中提取
in supplementation form or extracted from diet and nutrition
为了优化性类固醇激素  
in order to optimize sex steroid hormones,
再一次  我只想强调
and again, I just want to emphasize
我不建议任何人带任何东西
that I'm not suggesting anyone take anything
或停止服用任何东西  
or stop taking anything,
这纯粹是为了提供信息  
this is purely for informational purposes,
但是关于这些的一些数据
but some of the data on these
是非常惊人和令人印象深刻的
is quite striking and impressive.
很清楚
It's very clear
某些养分的收集是有用的
that certain collections of nutrients are useful
用于促进睾丸激素和雌激素的产生
for promoting testosterone and estrogen production
以适当的比例  
in their proper ratios,
这些就是我所说的
and those things are what I would call
那种通常的嫌疑犯  
the sort of usual suspects,
维生素D  这很重要
vitamin D, which is important
具有如此众多的生物学功能
for so many biological functions,
包括内分泌功能
including endocrine functions,
锌  镁等
zinc, magnesium, et cetera,
如果你想更深入地研究这个问题
and if you want to look into this more deeply
你想了解
and you want to understand
到底是什么负面影响
exactly what the negative effects are
没有足够的锌和镁  
of not having sufficient zinc and magnesium,
以及这些水平实际上可能是什么  
and what those levels might actually be,
有可用的论文  你可以在PubMed上进行  
there's a paper that's available, you can go on PubMed,
我不能说这个姓氏  很抱歉  
I can't pronounce this last name, I'm sorry,
在我看来  它就像Wrzosek  但它是WRZOSEK  
it looks to me like Wrzosek, but it's W-R-Z-O-S-E-K,
我希望我不会那么糟  Wrzosek等 2020年
I hope I didn't butcher that too badly, Wrzosek et al. 2020
在《内分泌与代谢评论》中
in "Endocrinology and Metabolism Review,"
所以这是一篇优秀的  经过同行评审的期刊上的最新论文
so this is a recent paper in a good, peer-reviewed journal
主要谈论
that talks mainly about
下丘脑-垂体-肾上腺轴如何
how the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
和性类固醇激素
and the sex steroid hormones
受到镁缺乏的负面影响  
are negatively impacted by deficiencies in magnesium,
维生素D和锌的缺乏  
deficiencies in vitamin D, and deficiencies in zinc,
但是  这并不指向水平
however, that doesn't point to the levels
为了优化而应该采取的措施
that one should take in order to optimize,
所以并没有说要摄取X量的锌
so it doesn't say take X amount of zinc
或X量的镁或X量的维生素D  
or X amount of magnesium or X amount of vitamin D,
对于这些信息  
for that information,
因为它是如此依赖于上下文和依赖于个体  
because it's so context-dependent and individual-dependent,
我极力建议你访问inspect.com  
I highly recommend you go to examine.com,
你可以放入锌或镁或维生素D  
you can put in zinc or magnesium or vitamin D,
他们会给你剂量范围
and they will give you ranges of dosages
受到特定研究的支持  
that are supported by specific studies,
同样  这些信息对你完全免费  
again, that information is completely free to you,
这对于弄清这一点非常有用
and it's very useful in figuring that out.
我个人有补充
I personally have supplemented
含有锌  镁和维生素D多年  
with zinc, magnesium, and vitamin D for years,
但是其他很多人也这样做
but many other people do that as well,
问题总是  多少钱？
and the question is always, how much?
这就是为什么我支持完成血液工作的原因
And that's why I'm a proponent of getting blood work done
因为那是你知道的
because that's how you know
无论你的雄激素水平如何  
whether or not your androgen levels,
以及维生素D等的水平  
as well as things like vitamin D levels, et cetera,
足够高
are sufficiently high,
所以这些研究的重点
so the takeaway from these studies
找出造成缺陷的原因
looking at what deficiencies cause
在睾丸激素和雌激素缺乏方面
in terms of deficits in testosterone and estrogen
确实指向
really point in the direction of,
确保获得足够的锌  镁和D3
make sure you're getting adequate zinc, magnesium, and D3
除非你希望降低这些类固醇激素的水平
unless you want these steroid hormone levels to be reduced
无论出于什么原因
for whatever reason.
一次又一次显示的一件事
One of the things that's been shown time and time again
对性类固醇激素产生非常不利的影响  
to have very negative effects on sex steroid hormones,
睾丸激素主要是男性  雌激素主要是女性  
testosterone mainly men, estrogen mainly in women,
是阿片类药物
is opioids.
当然  这是整个问题
There's this whole issue, of course,
关于阿片类药物的流行  值得一整集  
of the opioid epidemic, it's deserving of an entire episode,
我们将与成瘾专家讨论
we are going to talk about that with experts in addiction
还有治疗疼痛的人等等
and people that treat pain and so forth,
但阿片类药物大大减少
but the opioids dramatically reduce
睾丸激素和雌激素的水平
levels of testosterone and estrogen,
他们这样做主要是通过破坏受体
and they do that mainly by disrupting the receptors
在促性腺激素释放激素神经元上
on gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons,
下丘脑内的这些神经元
these neurons within the hypothalamus
与垂体沟通  
that communicate to the pituitary,
实际上  服用大量阿片类药物的人
and in fact, people that take large amounts of opioids,
甚至长时间服用低剂量的阿片类药物  
or even take low levels of opioids for long periods of time,
会发展出各种内分泌综合症
will develop all sorts of endocrine syndromes,
一遍又一遍地显示出来  
that's been shown over and over again,
男性乳房发育或男性乳房发育  
gynecomastia, or male breast development in males,
女性卵巢破裂  
disruptions to the ovary in females,
这确实是一个非常糟糕的情况  
it's really a quite terrible situation,
所以过量的阿片类药物非常成问题
so excessive opioids are very problematic
对于性类固醇激素  
for sex steroid hormones,
我认为没有人会有任何麻烦
I don't think anyone will have any trouble
找到任何有关这方面的文献  
finding any literature on that,
你可以进入PubMed  
you can just go into PubMed,
你可以放阿片类药物  睾丸激素或阿片类药物  雌激素  
you can put opioids, testosterone, or opioids, estrogen,
但主要的作用实际上是在下丘脑中
but the major effect is actually way up in the hypothalamus
关闭GnRH的生产  
to shut down the production of GnRH,
刺激激素
the very hormone that stimulates
睾丸激素和雌激素的释放
testosterone and estrogen release.
那么  整个行业都致力于补充
Now, there's an entire industry devoted to supplements
人们可以接受的各种事物
and various things that people can take
增加睾丸激素  
to increase testosterone,
其中一些拥有科学数据来支持它们  
some of which have scientific data to support them,
其中一些不
some of which do not,
其中一些有传闻的支持
and some of which have anecdotal support
有些则没有
and some of which do not.
范围如此广泛  
This ranges so broadly,
我的意思是  像鹿角一样的东西  
I mean, things like the material off deer antlers,
大概是IGF1
which is high in, supposedly, IGF1,
在生长激素途径中
which is in the growth hormone pathway,
一直到公牛睾丸的实际消耗  
all the way to actual consumption of bull testes,
你现在可以上亚马逊
you can go on Amazon right now,
我当然不建议你这样做  
I certainly don't suggest that you do this,
你实际上可以从奶牛那里购买碎的睾丸  
and you can actually buy ground up testes from cows,
你可以吃掉那些
and you can consume those,
那么  很多事情将在肠道中分解  
now, a lot of that's going to be broken down in the gut,
我当然不建议你这样做  
I'm certainly not suggesting you do that,
但要指出的是  这是一本浩如烟海的文学作品  
but just the point out this is a huge and vast literature,
实际上可以追溯到几百年前
and it actually dates back hundreds of years
即使很久以前才发现睾丸激素
even though testosterone wasn't discovered that long ago
作为一种特定的激素分子
as a specific hormone molecule
然后进行表征  然后重新合成  
and characterized and then resynthesized,
它有一个巨大的产业
it has a huge industry
由于它具有强大的作用  
because of the powerful effects that it has,
同样是雌激素
likewise with estrogen,
避孕药的发展
the development of the birth control pill
只有通过了解结构才有可能
was only made possible by understanding the structure
雌激素和雌二醇
of estrogen and estradiol,
我们将讨论所有有关节育的内容
and we're going to talk all about birth control
及其运作方式及其对其他各种途径的影响
and how it works and its influence on various other pathways
在未来的一集中
in a future episode,
但是有这些补充化合物
but there are these supplement compounds
科学文献支持的
that are supported by the scientific literature
就其调节雄激素的能力而言  
in terms of their ability to adjust androgens,
像睾丸激素和二氢睾丸激素
things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.
其中之一
One of the ones that has
肌酸是一个很好的证据  
really good evidence for it is creatine,
很明显  关于肌酸的东西  
it's very clear that something about creatine,
尽管机制还不十分清楚  
although the mechanism isn't exactly clear,
要么增加5-α还原酶
either increases 5-alpha reductase
或使睾丸激素分子更易感
or makes the testosterone molecule more susceptible
对某些酶反应
to certain enzymatic reactions
导致DHT升高  
that leads to increases in DHT,
DHT  二氢睾丸激素  
DHT, dihydrotestosterone,
正如我在上一集中提到的
as I mentioned in the previous episode,
在创造过程中扮演着重要角色
has this dramatic role in creating
产前大脑的一种男性化  
a kind of masculinization of the brain prenatally,
它也定义了主要的性别特征
it also defines the primary sex characteristic
阴茎的生长等等
of the growth of the penis, et cetera,
以及婴儿期  幼儿期和以后的生活  
and beyond infancy and early childhood and later in life,
它在产生秃顶方面具有强大的作用  
it has powerful effects in creating balding,
在胡须生长等方面  
in beard growth, et cetera,
对雄激素受体有更高的亲和力
and it has a much higher affinity for the androgen receptor
比睾丸激素
than does testosterone,
所以肌酸可以增加DHT  
so creatine can increase DHT,
这意味着如果你服用肌酸
which means that if you take creatine
而且你很容易被DHT感染  
and you're very DHT-susceptible,
那你可能会掉头发
then you might experience some hair loss,
这已经引起了广泛的争论  肌酸会导致脱发吗？
this has been heavily debated, does creatine cause baldness?
这要取决于
It's going to depend,
这取决于你有多少5-α还原酶
it's going to depend on how much 5-alpha reductase you have
以及你有多容易脱发
and how prone to hair loss you are,
有些人可以服用肌酸而没有任何问题
some people can take creatine without any problem
在脱发方面
in terms of hair loss,
有些人不能  他们开始脱发
some people cannot, they start losing their hair
至少对他们来说不舒服
to levels that, at least for them, aren't comfortable.
还有其他一些事情可以增加睾丸激素
There are a few other things that can increase testosterone
这与方式有关
and it has to do with the way
睾丸激素以其游离形式和结合形式存在  
that testosterone exists in its free and its bound form,
所以睾丸激素  这个分子是总睾丸激素的一种  
so testosterone, the molecule is kind of total testosterone,
通常是要测量的
that's usually what's measured,
这是通常抛出的那种级别
this is the kind of levels that are typically thrown around
是300到900之间的自然范围
of anywhere from 300 to 900 being the kind of natural range,
然后是超生理的
and then supraphysiological,
上升到1,200  1,600范围  
getting up into 1,200, 1,600 range,
但是睾丸激素不是
but testosterone isn't
只是在血液中自由地漫游  
just roaming around free in the blood,
至少大部分不是  
at least most of it isn't,
大多数都绑定了
most of it is bound
性激素结合球蛋白  SHBG或白蛋白的结合  
to either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG, or to albumin,
他们需要作为运输者
they're needed as transporters
使睾丸激素进入细胞
to get testosterone into cells
这样睾丸激素可以对基因表达产生影响
so that testosterone can have its effects on gene expression
以及细胞内的其他途径  
as well as other pathways within the cells,
所以人们谈论游离睾丸激素的水平
so people talk about that the level of free testosterone
真的很重要
is really what's important
而你想优化游离睾丸激素  
and that you want to optimize free testosterone,
这有点棘手  
that's a little bit of a tricky statement,
有点像  是真的  
that's kind of like, it's true,
然而  这并不是真正的反思
and yet, it's not really reflective
彻底了解
of a thorough understanding
这些结合球蛋白是如何工作的  
of how these binding globulins work,
记住  这些结合球蛋白
remember, these binding globulins
不是在那里吸收所有的睾丸激素
aren't there to soak up all your testosterone
只是让你很难释放睾丸激素
just to make it hard for you to free up testosterone
而且你知道  在体育馆或其他任何地方都可以赚钱  
and you know, make gains in the gym or whatever it is,
或性欲增加  
or have increases in libido,
他们在那里实际运输睾丸激素
they're there to actually transport testosterone
到特定的组织  以将它们穿梭到特定的组织
to specific tissues, to shuttle them to specific tissues
并设定结合和未结合睾丸激素的比率
and to set the rate of bound and unbound testosterone
所以这不是一次全部解除绑定  
so that's it's not all unbound at once,
而且你知道  这总是很有趣
and you know, it's always interesting
看文献
to look in the literature
看看每个人都想要
and see how everyone wants
释放他们的睾丸激素  使其起作用
to free up their testosterone so that it can work,
但是性激素结合球蛋白
but sex hormone binding globulin
会结合过多的睾丸激素
can bind up too much testosterone
到对性欲产生负面影响的地步
to the point where it's having negative effects on libido
或关于肌肉生长和脂肪流失之类的事情  
or on muscle growth and fat loss and things of that sort,
男性和女性都是如此  
this is true in males and females,
或者它可以完全按照预期的方式工作  
or it can be doing exactly what it's supposed to do,
这是穿梭睾丸激素
which is shuttling testosterone
到适当的组织和器官
to the proper tissues and organs
它具有所有这些作用  包括大脑
where it has all these effects, including the brain.
所以有补品  
So there are supplements,
特别是东革阿里  
in particular, tongkat ali,
也就是这个名字
which is, it has this other name,
这就是所谓的tongkat ali  
it's something called tongkat ali,
有时被称为
sometimes it's called,
并原谅我很难发音  
and forgive me that it's hard to pronounce,
但是Eurycoma longifolia Jack  
but Eurycoma longifolia Jack,
他们似乎总是有这些名字
they always seem to have these names
那种暗示雄激素的特征  
that kind of allude to androgenic features,
就像我不知道为什么  longifolia Jack  
like I don't know why, longifolia Jack,
我不知道  我认为这很明显
I don't know, I think it's kind of obvious
为什么听起来有点雄激素
why that sounds sort of androgenic.
多项研究表明了这一点  
This has been shown in several studies,
你可以在inspect.com上找到它们  
and you can find these on examine.com,
或者你也可以去PubMed  我已经看过这些了  
or you can go to PubMed if you like, I've looked at these,
它似乎确实有一定的生育能力  
that it does seem to have some pro-fertility,
不含睾丸激素的促效剂和微妙的壮阳作用  
pro-free testosterone, and subtle aphrodisiac effects,
它似乎也有轻微的抗雌激素作用  
it does also seem to be a slight anti-estrogen,
所以这个的报告是
so the reports of this are,
人们每天服用400至800毫克  
people take this anywhere from
400 to 800 milligrams a day,
再一次  我不建议你这样做  
again, I'm not suggesting you do that,
但这就是那种
but that's kind of what's out there,
并且有一些不错的科学文献
and there is some decent scientific literature
支持它解放的事实
to support the fact that it liberates
一些结合的睾丸激素
some of the bound testosterone
并提供更多免费的睾丸激素  
and allows more free testosterone to be available,
一些报道的引用-取消引用的副作用
some of the reported quote-unquote side effects
是过度警觉和失眠之类的事情
are things like excessive alertness and insomnia
如果一天来得太晚等等
if it's taken too late in the day and so forth,
但我鼓励你进一步探索这一点  
but I encourage you to explore that further if that's,
如果增加游离睾丸激素
if increasing free testosterone
是你感兴趣的事情
is something that you're interested in doing.
Examine.com还包含许多其他内容
Examine.com includes a lot of other things
可以增加睾丸激素  
that can increase testosterone,
已经发生的事情之一
one of the things that's been
据说可以释放血液中的睾丸激素
purported to free up testosterone in the blood
荨麻  刺荨麻  
are things like nettles, stinging nettles,
尽管我应该指出文学
although I should point out that the literature
指向荨麻
points to stinging nettle
也有一些相当有效的作用
also having some fairly potent effects
在前列腺和肝脏上  
on the prostate and on the liver,
所以这可能是一个棘手的分子
and so it might be a tricky molecule
也许对人们来说没有吸引力
and maybe not an attractive one for people to take.
所以我们谈到了肌酸  我们谈到了东革阿里  
So we talked about creatine, we talked about tongkat ali,
很明显  硼很有趣  
it's clear that boron, which is really interesting,
信不信由你  我想硼来自
believe it or not, I think boron comes from,
我认为这些就像流星降落在地球上一样
I think these were like, meteors that landed on Earth
现在他们提取硼
and now they extract boron,
这是这些疯狂的故事之一  当你看着它时  
it's one of these crazy stories that, when you look at it,
你会说：“怎么可能？”
you go like, "How could that possibly be?"
但实际上是这样的  
but there's actually, that's how it works,
硼  有一些科学上的支持
that boron, there's some scientific support
因为它释放了更多的睾丸激素  
for it freeing up more testosterone,
再一次释放睾丸激素
and again, freeing up testosterone
可能正是你想要的  
may be exactly what you want,
我只是不认为我们应该
I just don't think that we should
妖魔化这些载体蛋白  例如白蛋白和SHBG  
demonize these carrier proteins like albumin and SHBG,
其实白蛋白很重要
in fact, albumin is very important
使睾丸激素能够进入大脑
for testosterone to be able to make it into the brain
产生一些促雄激素作用
to have some of the pro-androgenic effects
对睾丸激素的认知作用
on the cognitive effects of testosterone
因为无论是男性还是女性  
because in both males and females,
睾丸激素可以改变这些行为  例如寻求伴侣  
testosterone can shift these behaviors, like mate-seeking,
减少焦虑等
reductions in anxiety, and so forth,
我们之前讨论过的
that we talked about before,
只有进入大脑
only by making it into the brain,
有一个叫做血脑屏障的东西  
and there is this thing called the blood-brain barrier,
令人着迷
which is fascinating
并且值得一整集  
and deserving of an entire episode also,
并使分子穿过血脑屏障  
and getting molecules across the blood-brain barrier,
即使它们是性脂固醇激素
even if they're sex steroid hormones, which are lipophilic
并可以穿过细胞膜  需要载体  
and can pass through cell membranes, requires carriers,
这些载体通常会结合或包含白蛋白  
and those carriers often are bound to or include albumin,
因此  释放所有睾丸激素并不是目的  
and so it's not the goal to free up all your testosterone,
但将游离睾丸激素纳入研究范围
but getting free testosterone into a range
可以满足你的特定目标和需求
that works for your particular goals and needs
是一个吸引人的人  
is an attractive one,
这就是我们讨论这些特定工​​具的原因
and that's why we're discussing these particular tools.
人们摄取的硼的量  
The amounts of boron that people take,
你可以在PubMed或Examine中再次找到它  
and you can find this, again, on PubMed or Examine,
但是人们每天要服用几克  
but people take a couple grams of it a day,
我不知道有任何特定的副作用  
I'm not aware of any specific side effects,
但是你总是  总是  总是想检查
but you always, always, always want to examine
对于特定的副作用
for the particular side effects
以及有不同背景和条件的人  
and people with different backgrounds and conditions,
正如我们谈到的更年期和雌激素
as we talked about for menopause and estrogen,
一定要小心
have to be careful
因为当你开始调节激素时  
because when you're starting to modulate hormones,
你开始调节的不仅仅是组织
you're starting to modulate not just the tissues
通过结合这些激素而蓬勃发展  
that thrive on binding of those hormones,
但请记住  乳腺癌如此之多的原因
but remember, the reason why there's so much breast cancer
还有一个原因就是睾丸癌如此之多
and there's a reason why there's so much testicular cancer
是任何经历快速繁殖的组织
is that any tissue that undergoes rapid reproduction
特定的细胞
of particular cells,
所以细胞繁殖很多
so there's a lot of reproduction of cells
在子宫内膜脱落
in shedding of uterine lining
以及卵巢中细胞和卵的繁殖  
and the reproduction of cells and eggs in the ovary,
在睾丸中  有生产
and in the testes, there's the production
Leydig和sertoli细胞   of Leydig and sertoli cells,
而且这种类型的精子正在不断地产生  
and there's this kind of ongoing production of sperm,
这就是为什么这些组织特别脆弱的原因
that's why those tissues are particularly vulnerable
对癌症的发展  
to the development of cancers,
而且其中许多癌症都是对雄激素敏感的  
and many of those cancers are androgen-sensitive,
这就是为什么主要的治疗方法之一
that's why one of the major treatments
用于前列腺过度生长或前列腺癌
for prostate overgrowth or prostate cancer
是要给抗雄激素药好吗？
is to give anti-androgenic drugs, okay?
不只是关闭所有事物
It's not just to shut down all things
与被雄化有关
related to being androgenized,
真的是要预防睾丸激素
it's really about trying to prevent testosterone
从鼓励肿瘤生长  
from encouraging growth of tumors,
所以我要特别强调一下
so I want to really emphasize the caution there
因为思考的时候很容易
because it's easy when thinking
关于优化雌激素和睾丸激素
about optimizing estrogen and testosterone
只是想  哦  越多越好  
to just think, oh, more is better,
绝对不是更好  
more is definitely not better,
不只是因为它们可以加香
and it's not just because they can aromatize
或转化为其他东西  
or convert into other things,
因为癌症
it's because cancers,
或任何具有大量细胞周转的组织  
or any tissue that has a lot of turnover of cells,
会在雄激素上蓬勃发展  
is going to thrive on androgen,
任何促进增长的东西
anything that promotes growth
会在雌激素上蓬勃发展  
is going to thrive on estrogen,
记住  脑组织的翻转不多  
remember, brain tissue doesn't turn over that much,
实际上并没有太多的新神经元产生  
there isn't really much production of new neurons,
脑癌发生了  但很罕见  
brain cancers happen but they're kind of rare,
当它们发生时  
and when they do happen,
他们往往是神经胶质细胞  
they tend to be glial cells,
有很多扩散
which have a lot of proliferation,
胶质细胞可以增殖  
glial cells can proliferate,
成人神经元不会创造更多自己的东西  
adult neurons don't create more of themselves,
他们不会创造更多的神经元  
they don't create more neurons,
一般而言  除了大脑和身体的一些地方  
in general, except in a few places in the brain and body,
因此  任何自身回收的组织都容易患癌症  
so any tissue that recycles itself is prone to cancers,
那些组织在雄激素和雌激素上壮成长
and those tissues thrive on androgens and estrogens
产生更多的肿瘤  
to create more tumor,
所以你要小心点
so you have to be careful
每当你调节激素时  
anytime you're modulating hormones,
特别是雄激素和雌激素  
especially androgens and estrogens,
在我的文学搜寻中
and in my scouring of the literature
并看看那里有什么
and looking at kind of what's out there
以及人们在谈论什么
and what people are talking about,
在科学文献中  我的意思是  
and I also mean in the scientific literature,
无论如何  对我来说是新事物之一
one of the things that is new to me, anyway,
可能对那里的许多健身老鼠来说都不是新鲜事  
probably not new to a lot of the gym rats out there,
或在YouTube影片上花费大量时间的人
or the people that spend a lot of time on YouTube videos
谈论雄激素  
talking about androgens,
这些  请原谅我再次屠杀这个名字  
are these, forgive me for butchering the name again,
这些蜕皮类固醇  
are these ecdysteroids,
所以蜕皮类固醇是分子
so ecdysteroids are molecules
来自菠菜之类的东西  信不信由你  
that come from things like spinach, believe it or not,
与胆固醇分子有很多相似之处
that have a lot of similarity to the cholesterol molecule,
现在正在讨论很多的那个
the one that's being discussed a lot out there right now
是所谓的turkesterone  
is something called turkesterone,
我希望我知道为什么它被称为turkesterone  
I wish I knew why it was called turkesterone,
有人告诉我为什么叫turkesterone  
someone tell me why it's called turkesterone,
它和火鸡有关系吗？
does it have anything to do with turkeys?
我不知道为什么叫turkesterone
I don't know why it's called turkesterone,
也许有人会知道
perhaps someone will know.
无论如何  这些蜕皮激素
In any case, these ecdysteroids
足够类似于胆固醇
are similar enough to cholesterol,
记住  胆固醇是前体
and remember, cholesterol is the precursor
去睾丸激素  皮质醇和雌激素
to testosterone, cortisol, and estrogen,
而且似乎有些蜕皮类固醇
and it appears that some of these ecdysteroids
确实具有生物利用度
do have bioavailability,
或其代谢物具有生物利用度  
or their metabolites are bioavailable,
多年以来  
and this was something that, for many years,
人们谈论昆虫激素是否
people talked about whether or not insect hormones
或其他物种的激素
or hormones from other species
实际上可以被人类使用
could actually be used by humans
或者它是否会产生任何作用  
or whether or not it would have any effect at all,
根据一项研究很明显
and it's pretty clear based on a study
我能够找到  
that I was able to find,
在2019年有一篇论文发表了
there's a paper that came out in 2019,
这是《毒理学档案》中的一项比较研究  
it's a comparative study in the "Archives of Toxicology,"
这是艾森曼（Isenmann）等人  艾森曼（ISENMANN）等人  
this is Isenmann et al., I-S-E-N-M-A-N-N et al.,
谈论蜕皮激素
that talks about the ecdysteroids
它是结合在一起给出的
and it was given in conjunction
接受力量训练或没有力量训练  
with strength training or no strength training,
这是一个十周的干预  
this was a 10-week intervention,
他们的结论是这些蜕皮激素
and their conclusion is that these ecdysteroids
有一个相当重要的安慰剂对照  
had a fairly significant, above placebo controls,
增加肌肉质量  力量  肥大作用  
increases in muscle mass, strength, hypertrophy effects,
人们会期望的各种各样的事情
all the sorts of things that one would expect
随着雄激素的增加  
with increases in androgen,
他们对这项研究的结论不是我的结论  
their conclusion of this study is not my conclusion,
尽管我可能同意也可能不同意  
although I may or may not agree with them,
这不是我的意见  
this isn't about my opinions,
只是  我想清楚一点  
it's just, I want to be clear,
这些是他们的话  不是我的  
these are their words, not mine,
但是他们用他们的话说
but they say that, in their words,
引用“我们的结果强烈建议
quote, "Our results strongly suggest
“蜕皮类固醇的纳入
"the inclusion of ecdysteroid
“在禁止使用的物质清单中”
"in the list of prohibited substances."
所以他们说这些东西是如此强大
So they're saying these things are so powerful
它们应该在违禁物质清单中  
that they should be on the list of banned substances,
这可能使某些人不高兴  
which might be upsetting to some,
或你们中的某些人可能在想  谁在乎？
or some of you might be thinking, well, who cares?
运动中增加激素的整个问题
The whole issue of augmenting hormones in sports
是一个非常有趣的问题  
is a very interesting issue,
实际上  如果你只想了解一点轶事  
in fact, if you just want a little anecdote about that,
我当然不能在这里透露姓名  
I can't reveal names here, of course,
但是我最近学到的东西对我来说非常令人惊讶
but what I learned recently was very surprising to me
这是很多从事专业运动的运动员
which is that many athletes in pro sports
正在服用睾丸激素  
are taking testosterone,
他们能够合法地做到这一点
and they are able to do that legally
不只是因为它可以通过处方获得  
not just because it's available by prescription,
但他们被允许这样做
but they are allowed to do that
在他们的运动规则下
under the rules of their sport
精美的印刷品  包括我在内  没有人见过  
in the fine print that no one, including me, had ever seen,
如果他们受伤了
if they've had an injury,
所以如果运动员受伤  那就打开门
so if athletes are injured, then it opens up the door
用于某些形式的睾丸激素增强
for certain forms of testosterone augmentation
和其他类型的扩充
and other types of augmentations
如果他们没有受伤  他们将无法获得这些东西  
that are not available to them if they're not injured,
这总是让我感到奇怪
which always makes me wonder now
当我看到他们受伤时
when I see them getting injured
是否试图获得一些支持
whether or not that's an attempt to get some of the support
因为绝对没有问题
because there's absolutely no question
雌激素和睾丸激素调节基因表达  
that estrogens and testosterones modulate gene expression,
调节力量  调节大脑的运作方式  
modulate strength, modulate the way the brain works,
调节我们与努力和焦虑的关系  等等
modulates our relationship to effort and anxiety, et cetera,
当我们谈论补充时  
and while we're talking about supplementation,
补充的效果  
the effects of supplementation,
我会说  在某些人中可能会非常戏剧化  
I would say, in some individuals can be quite dramatic,
但他们永远  永远  永远
but they're always, always, always,
除非在极端情况下  否则会变得更加微妙  
except in extreme cases, going to be far subtler,
对不起  更微妙的是  
excuse me, far more subtle,
使用适当的英语  
to use the proper English,
比现在要微妙得多
far more subtle than would be,
例如  只是注射睾丸激素
for instance, just in injecting testosterone
或注射雌激素等
or injecting estrogen, et cetera,
因此  我认为我们应该对此诚实和坦率
so I think we should just be honest and upfront about that.
到目前为止  在谈论优化激素方面
So thus far in terms of talking about optimizing hormones
在补充的讨论中  
and in the discussion of supplementation,
我还没有真正谈论过事情
I haven't really talked about things
实际上直接影响大脑  
that actually affect the brain directly,
增加了脑垂体的输出和类似的东西  
that increase the pituitary output and things of that sort,
我们主要是在谈论事情
we've mainly been talking about things
释放睾丸激素或增加雌激素
that free up testosterone or that increase estrogen
在外围的水平  
at the level of the periphery,
但是如果你还记得回来的路
but if you remember way back
到这集的开始  
to the beginning of this episode,
激素是在人体的不同部位产生的
hormones are made in different locations in the body
还有激素
and there are hormones
促进激素的释放和产生
that promote the release and the production of hormones
来自身体其他组织
from other tissues in the body,
也是其中的主要激素之一
and one of the main hormones for that
是促黄体激素  
is luteinizing hormone,
黄体生成激素又来自垂体  
luteinizing hormone, again, comes from the pituitary,
循环  要么去卵巢
circulates and either goes to the ovary
促进卵子成熟的各个方面
to promote various aspects of egg maturation
以及雌激素的产生
as well as production of estrogen,
并向睾丸推广
and to the testes to promote
睾丸激素和精子的产生  
testosterone and sperm production,
和处方版本
and the prescription version
黄体生成素的增加
of increasing luteinizing hormone
是一种叫做hCG或人类绒毛膜促性腺激素的物质  
is something called hCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin,
已经合成
which has been synthesized
现在可以作为处方药使用
and is now available as a prescription drug,
在各种情况下都采取了这种措施以增加生育能力
it's taken in various contexts for increasing fertility
无论是男性还是女性  
both by males and by females,
由于现在所有有意义的原因  它可以增加  
it can increase, for all the reasons that now make sense,
它可以增加精子的产量  
it can increase sperm production,
它可以产生排卵频率  
it can produce ovulation frequency,
它可以产生卵子的数量  甚至
it can produce the number of eggs, even,
排卵期
that are deployed in a given ovulation,
尽管这并不总是一件好事  
although that's not always a good thing,
基本上就是生育
it basically is pro-fertility,
睾丸激素  雌激素
pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen
根据你的背景  
depending on your background,
有趣的是
and what's interesting is
hCG最初是合成的 hCG was initially synthesized,
从孕妇的尿液中收集和合成的  
collected and synthesized from pregnant women's urine,
在合成之前先信不信
and believe it or not, before it was synthetically made
并作为处方药出售  
and sold as a prescription drug,
孕妇尿液实际上有一个黑市
there was actually a black market for pregnant women's urine
人们会在哪里买尿  
where people would buy the urine,
我不知道  我猜他们可能
I don't know, I'm guessing that they probably
刚刚吃掉了  这很奇怪  
just consumed it, which is weird,
但无论如何  人类绒毛膜促性腺激素
but in any case, human chorionic gonadotropin
现在可以作为处方药
is now available as a prescription drug
这是很多人使用的东西之一
and it's one of the things that many people use
增加睾丸激素或雌激素
to increase testosterone or estrogen
为了增加生育力
for increasing fertility,
在某些情况下  我认为它已被使用
in some cases I think it's used
提高运动表现
to increase sports performance
或当人们关闭性腺时
or when people have shut down their gonads
出于任何原因  因为过度的激素治疗
for whatever reason because of excessive hormone therapies
或者他们有某种
or they have some sort of,
有时实际上垂体有病变  
sometimes there are actually lesions to the pituitary,
有时人们的脑垂体有肿瘤  
sometimes people have a tumor in the pituitary,
这实际上并不常见  
it's actually not common,
但是在脑瘤和神经瘤中
but among brain tumors and neural tumors,
这是较常见的一种
it's one of the more common ones,
然后你会发现LH和FSH的缺陷  
and then you get deficiencies in LH and FSH,
因此人们会服用hCG来刺激性腺  
and so people will take hCG to stimulate the gonads,
所以有多种原因
so there are a variety of reasons
为什么创造这些毒品  
why these drugs were created,
但是有一些补品  不是很多  
but there are certain supplements, not many,
显然可以增加促黄体激素
that apparently can increase luteinizing hormone
从而增加睾丸激素和雌激素  
and thereby can increase testosterone and estrogen,
证据更丰富的一种是Fadogia agrestis  
and one of the more well-documented one is Fadogia agrestis,
那是FADOGIA  
that's F-A-D-O-G-I-A,
单独的单词  AGRESTIS  
separate word, A-G-R-E-S-T-I-S,
至少根据文献
which, at least according to the literature
我能够找到  
that I was able to find,
可以增加促黄体激素水平
can increase levels of luteinizing hormone
因此  睾丸激素水平或雌激素水平  
and thereby levels of testosterone or levels of estrogen,
再一次  如果一个人要服用Fadogia agrestis  
and again, if an individual were to take Fadogia agrestis,
他们可能会发现什么
what they would probably find
是睾丸激素和雌激素会增加
is that testosterone and estrogen would increase
在任何具有染色体或性腺背景的人中  
in anyone of any chromosomal or gonadal background,
但请记住  这是两者的比率  
but remember, it's the ratio of both,
如果某人的雌激素水平低而睾丸激素水平高  
if someone has low estrogen and high testosterone,
举例来说  他们有睾丸  
let's say they have testes just by way of example,
那么这两个指标都有望增加  
then both of those would be expected to increase,
如果某人的雌激素水平高  睾丸激素水平低  
and if someone has high estrogen and low testosterone,
并说有卵巢
and let's just say has ovaries,
然后两者都会增加
then both of those would increase
通过服用Fadogia agrestis
by taking Fadogia agrestis.
Fadogia agrestis的副作用
The side effect profile of Fadogia agrestis
尚未真正记录在案  
hasn't really been documented,
所以还不清楚
so it's a little unclear,
我只想强调
I just want to emphasize
任何时候有人要开始服用补品  
that anytime someone's going to start taking supplements,
或修改性类固醇激素  
or modifying sex steroid hormones,
完成血液工作非常重要
getting blood work done is extremely important
出于安全原因  
for safety reasons,
而且还只是想知道事情是否在起作用  
and also just to know whether or not things are working,
而且因为所有这些事情
and because all of these things
受到负面反馈  
are subject to negative feedback,
之前在上一集中谈到了这一点  
talked about this previously on a previous episode,
但是如果睾丸激素升高或升高  
but if testosterone goes high, or too high,
它可以反馈并关闭黄体生成素  
it can feed back and shut down luteinizing hormone,
然后  这将进一步关闭睾丸激素的生产  
which will then shut down further testosterone production,
同样地  如果雌激素水平过高
likewise, if estrogens are going too high
或是在周期的各个阶段过高
or they're going too high at various phases of the cycle,
可以开始抛出其他各种激素  
that can start to throw off various other hormones,
包括FSH  孕酮  LH  
including FSH, progesterone, LH,
月经周期本身
the menstrual cycle itself
绝对是绝妙的平衡
is a just absolutely exquisite balance
黄体生成素的反馈保持较低且恒定  
of feedback of luteinizing hormone kept low and constant,
至少在周期的前14天  
at least for the first
14 days of the cycle,
然后是周期的中间  有一个高峰
then mid cycle, there's a peak,
通常是在排卵的时候
and that's typically when ovulation occurs,
这就是为什么最有可能怀孕的原因
that's why pregnancy is most likely
在28天周期的中间  
during the middle of the 28-day cycle,
FSH在开始的14天里先涨后跌  
FSH kind of goes up and then down across the first 14 days,
所以采取任何措施或进行真正的修改
so taking anything or really modifying
一个人的雌激素或睾丸激素
one's estrogens or testosterone
在月经周期的背景下
on that background of the menstrual cycle
确实会破坏这些事物相互作用的方式  
is really going to disrupt the way those things interact,
就是如此精致的反馈循环  
and it's just such an exquisite feedback loop,
所以我不是说不要那样做  
so I'm not saying don't do that,
但你绝对想知道自己在做什么  
but you definitely want to be aware of what you're doing,
抽血是做到这一点的一种方法  
and blood draws are one way to do that,
监测排卵周期
monitoring cycles for ovulating females
是另一种方式
is another way to do that,
在男性中  有一个很好的窗户
and in males, having a good window
了解睾丸激素  DHT的情况  
into what's going on with testosterone, DHT,
芳香化酶  雌二醇  LH等
aromatase, estradiol, LH, et cetera,
至关重要
is just vital,
这确实是实践的一部分
and it's really part and parcel with the practice
考虑优化这些不可思议的事情
of thinking about optimizing these incredible things
我们称之为性类固醇激素  
that we call sex steroid hormones,
雌激素和睾丸激素及其衍生物
estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives.
补充剂和分子列表
The list of supplements and molecules
可以调节雌激素和睾丸激素  
that can adjust estrogen and testosterone is vast,
我只涉及了其中一些  
and I only touched on a few of these,
我真的很想强调那些
I really tried to emphasize the ones
有人类研究的
for which there are human studies
或大部分是人类研究的
or that have mostly human studies,
甚至只是一项人类研究  
or maybe even just one human study,
还有其他事情
there are other things out there
有科学数据
for which there are scientific data,
像Bulpine natalensis这样的东西
things like Bulbine natalensis,
肯定支持增加睾丸激素
which definitely has support for increasing testosterone
但是所有的研究都是在老鼠身上进行的
but all the studies were in rats,
我认为人类有一些证据
I think there is some evidence in humans
但证据主要以形式
but the evidence mainly comes in the form
我们所说的赞助研究
of what we call sponsored research,
所以公司为研究付费  
so companies paying for research,
与独立研究不同
which is different than independent research
那些对结果没有偏见的人  
by people who are not biased in terms of the outcome,
和我没有的原因
and the reason I didn't
扔掉像娜娜花一样的东西
throw out things like Bulbine natalensis
他们似乎有肝毒性吗
is they seem to have liver toxicity
类似于高水平的合成代谢外源性类固醇  
similar to high levels of anabolic exogenous steroids,
他们有一些问题
there's some problems associated with them
这使他们很重要  需要思考
that make them, you know, important to think about
如果你对这个领域和内分泌学感到好奇  
if you're curious about this area and the endocrinology,
但也有些pre可危  
but also somewhat precarious,
而且那是一类
and you know, that's one category,
所以人类没有很多证据的东西  
so stuff that doesn't have a lot of evidence in humans,
可能实际上很危险  
might actually be dangerous,
另一类事物
the other category of things
已经证明可以提高
that has been shown to improve levels of,
或增加  我应该说  我不想说改善
or increase, I should say, I don't want to say improve
因为是否取决于你
because it's up to you whether or not
你想增加或减少雌激素和睾丸激素  
you want to increase or decrease estrogen and testosterone,
那是非常个人的  我怎么知道  
that's highly individual, how could I know,
是一些家政服务
are the things that are kind of housekeeping
用于生产雌激素和睾丸激素  
for production of estrogen and testosterone,
像镁  像D3  像锌
things like magnesium, things like D3, things like zinc,
你知道的  那是这些
you know, those are the things
将会创造一个整体的环境
that are going to create an overall milieu
产生正常内源水平的机会
of opportunity to produce normal endogenous levels
而不是进一步增加内源性水平  
rather than increasing endogenous levels further,
所以我真的想强调
and so I really want to highlight
拿东西有区别
that there's a difference between taking something
创造一种普遍支持的背景
to create a kind of backdrop of general support
并采取一些将导致大拐弯的东西
and taking something that's going to create a big inflection
在给定的激素水平
in the levels of a given hormone.
再次  我们涵盖了
So once again, we covered
大量的信息  
a tremendous amount of information,
我们涵盖了一些激素和信息素的基础科学  
we covered some basic science of hormones and pheromones,
雌激素和睾丸激素及其衍生物  
estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives,
我们谈到了补充和行为  
we talked about supplementation and behaviors,
竞争和养育子女  
competition and parenting,
以及所有这些事物如何相互作用  
and how all these things interact,
我希望你能摆脱这个
and I hope that you'll come away from this
具有更深的机械理解
with a deeper mechanistic understanding
大脑和身体如何相互作用
of how the brain and body are interacting
控制输出
to control the output
以及这些不可思议的事情的方式
and the ways in which these incredible things
我们称之为性类固醇激素起作用并影响我们  
that we call sex steroid hormones work and influence us,
我希望你也能提出一些想法
I hope you'll also come away with some ideas
你可以做的事情
of things that you can do,
特别是可以改善睡眠的行为习惯
in particular, behavioral practices that can improve sleep
以及你与光的关系等等
and your relationship to light, et cetera,
因为那些东西真的奠定了基础
because those things really set the foundation
不只是为了健康的类固醇激素输出  
not just for healthy steroid hormone output,
但对健康有种种影响
but for all sorts of health effects
对于心理学和生物学
