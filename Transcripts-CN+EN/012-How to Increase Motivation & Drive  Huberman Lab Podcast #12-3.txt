and the five free travel packs.
我们今天的播客的第二个赞助商是Headspace
Our second sponsor of today's podcast is Headspace.
Headspace是一种冥想应用程序  可简化冥想过程
Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.
从16岁起  我就一直在打坐和打坐
I've been meditating on and off since I was 16 years old.
我现在45岁
I'm 45 now.
所以这大约是30年的上下冥想
So that's about 30 years of on and off meditation
我承认大部分时间都没事
and I confess most of that time it was off,
意思是我真的很难坚持
meaning I find it really hard to stick
去打坐
to a meditation practice.
几年前我发现了Headspace
A few years ago I discovered Headspace
在捷蓝航空航班上飞行时
while flying on JetBlue flights
因为当时他们提供Headspace
cause at that time they were offering Headspace
作为你可以观看的内容  而不是电视或电影
as something you could watch instead of TV or movies.
这让我感觉很好
And it made me feel great.
我会发现我已经到了
I'd find that I arrived
我要去的地方  更休息  更放松
where I was going, more rested, more relaxed
我有了Headspace应用程序  并且每天开始使用它
and I got the Headspace app and I started using it daily
而且我每天都继续使用它
and I've continued to use it daily.
Headspace有很多冥想
Headspace has a large number of meditations
所有这些都得到科学的支持
all supported by science.
现在也有大量的科学
There's also now just a tremendous amount of science
支持冥想练习
supporting a meditation practice
对于诸如改善睡眠之类的各种事情
for all sorts of things like improved sleep,
减少冲动  提高认知度
reduced impulsivity, improved cognition.
冥想只有无数积极的影响
There are just a myriad of positive effects of meditation.
最难的是做
The hardest thing is doing it
而“Headspace”使这一过程变得容易
and Headspace makes that easy.
如果你想尝试Headspace应用程序
If you wanna try the Headspace app
和他们所有的冥想  你可以去
and all the meditations they have, you can go
前往headspace.com/special offer  你将获得
to headspace.com/special offer, and you'll get
一个月完全没有冥想
one month completely free of all the meditations
他们有headspace.com/special offer to
they have that's headspace.com/special offer to
免费获得一个月的Headspace
get one month free of Headspace.
当今播客的第三个赞助商是魔术匙
The third sponsor of today's podcast is magic spoon.
魔术勺是低碳水化合物
Magic spoon is a low carb,
无谷物的酮类谷物
grain-free keto friendly cereal.
正如我之前在此播客中提到的几次
As I've mentioned a few times before on this podcast
我整天的饮食方式无所不包
the way I eat throughout the day has everything to do
当我想保持警觉和想昏昏欲睡的时候
with when I wanna be alert and when I wanna be sleepy.
所以在一天的一开始（上午）
So in the first part of the day
我禁食  因为这可以提高机敏性
I fast because that enhances alertness.
然后我吃酮
Then I eat keto.
所以我的午餐和午饭都是生酮的
So my lunch and my afternoon meals are ketogenic
然后晚上我吃淀粉
and then in the evening I eat starches
和蔬菜  因为它们有助于过渡到睡眠
and vegetables because those aid the transition to sleep.
因此  对我而言  神奇的勺子作为酮类谷物是很棒的零食
So for me, magic spoon as a keto cereal is a great snack.
真好吃
It's really tasty.
我实际上没有将我的奶与牛奶混合
I don't actually mix mine with milk.
我就是直接吃
I just eat it directly.
他们有很多不同的口味
They have a bunch of different flavors.
我也喜欢磨砂的味道
I like the frosted flavor also
因为它的味道像甜甜圈
because it tastes like donuts.
而且我有糕点问题  而且我喜欢糕点
And I have a pastry affliction and I love pastries.
所以魔术匙让我留下来
So magic spoon allows me to remain
白天服用酮可保持健康
on keto during the day it's healthy.
很好吃
It tastes great.
我真的很喜欢它
I really enjoy it.
因此  如果你想尝试魔术匙
So if you wanna try magic spoon
你可以去magicspoon.com/huberman
you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman
适用于各种口味的包装
for a variety pack of different flavors.
如果你将Huberman放在结帐处

put "Huberman" at checkout you get 5 dollars off.
在我们开始今天的讨论之前的简短说明
A quick note before we begin today's discussion
关于动机的神经科学
about the neuroscience of motivation.
我很高兴地宣布
I'm pleased to announce
我们现在为第1集加上字幕
that we have now captioned episodes one
还有两个西班牙语  很快所有的情节
and two in Spanish and soon, all the episodes
Huberman Lab播客的标题将带字幕 of the Huberman Lab
Podcast will be captioned
在YouTube上以西班牙语显示
on YouTube in Spanish.
我们已经用了一些收入
We've used some of the revenue
从播客中聘请专业字幕制作者
from the podcast to hire expert captioners.
因此  它应该是准确的
So it should be accurate.
你可能会在这里遇到错误
You might catch a mistake here
或时有方言差异
or there a dialect difference from time to time
但是根据我们的读物和我们的专家的读物
but by our read and by our experts reads,
都是正确的
it's all accurate.
所以我们很高兴那些说西班牙语的人
So we're very pleased that people who speak Spanish
并以西班牙语最好地消化信息  现在可以
and digest information best in Spanish can now
在播客上摘要此处的信息
digest the information here on the podcast.
感谢大家对播客的支持
Thanks to everyone for supporting the podcast
这使我们可以通过这些方式扩大影响范围
which allows us to broaden our reach in these ways
我们确实希望扩大
and we do hope to expand
在不久的将来转换为其他语言
to other languages in the very near future.
这个月  我们正在谈论所有
This month, we're talking all
关于情绪的神经科学
about the neuroscience of emotions
今天我们要谈论的是
and today we're going to talk about an extremely
对我们日常生活至关重要的重要话题
important topic that central to our daily life
这就是动机
and that's motivation.
我们将谈论快乐和奖励
We're going to talk about pleasure and reward.
是我们愉悦或报酬的基础
What underlies our sense of pleasure or reward.
我们将谈论成瘾
We're going to talk about addictions.
你不能谈论快乐
You can't have a discussion about pleasure
和奖励  不用讨论成瘾
and reward without having a discussion about addictions
以及某些物质的成瘾性
and the addictive properties of certain substances
以及如何摆脱沉迷
as well as how to break free of addiction.
同样  我们要谈谈
As well we're going to talk
关于动力和心态的神经化学
about the neurochemistry of drive and mindset.
所以所有这些主题都交织在一起
So all these themes are woven together
在情感的背景下
in the context of emotions.
其中每一个因素当然也可以
Each one of them of course could also
成为整个月的播客主题
be its own entire month of the podcast
实际上  我们将把接下来
and in fact, we are going to have
一整月的时间都在放在“成瘾”上
an entire month devoted to addiction
我有一个非常特别的客人
and I have a very special guest
那将会加入我们的行列
that's going to be joining us
谈论科学
to talk about the science
和我们知道的临床实践
and clinical practices that we know are important
对于了解和治疗成瘾很重要
for understanding and treating addiction.
但是现在  我们只讨论神经科学
But for now, let's just talk about the neuroscience
动机与愉悦与痛苦的回报
of motivation and reward of pleasure and pain
因为这些对于我们认为的情感至关重要
because those are central to what we think of as emotions
我们是否感觉良好
whether or not we feel good,
我们是否觉得自己在生活中步入正轨
whether or not we feel we're on track in life
无论我们是否感到自己落后
whether or not we feel we're falling behind.
因此  动力对我们的日常生活至关重要
So motivation is fundamental to our daily life.
这就是让我们早上起床的原因
It's what allows us to get out of bed in the morning.
这就是我们追求长期目标的原因
It's what allows us to pursue long-term goals
或短期目标
or short-term goals,
动机与动机化学
motivation and the chemistry of motivation
与运动的神经化学紧密相连
is tightly wound in with the neurochemistry of movement.
实际上  相同的单分子多巴胺
In fact, the same single molecule ,dopamine
既对我们的动力负责
is responsible for our sense of motivation
也对运动负责  即使神经控制肌肉
and for movement, even though nerves controlling muscles.
再说一遍  这些是脊髓中的神经
So again, these are nerves in the spinal cord
让我们活动四肢的大脑  效应化学物质
or brain that move our limbs, the effector chemical
让肌肉抽搐  收缩的化学物质
they're the one that actually causes the muscles to
是大脑中的乙酰胆碱
twitch to contract, is a Acetylcholine in the brain.
乙酰胆碱负责注意力
Acetylcholine is responsible for focus.
但是  不管我们是否在动
However, whether or not we move,
我们是否在动
whether or not we want to move
我们是否有克服障碍的愿望
whether or not we have the desire to overcome barriers of
他们可能是社会障碍
they could be social barriers
或财务障碍或时间限制
or financial barriers or time constraints.
都取决于这个分子
That depends on this molecule.
我们称之为多巴胺  这是一个令人着迷的分子
We call dopamine, it's a fascinating molecule
它是生活中许多美好事物的中心
and it lies at the center of so many great things in life
它也是
and it lies at the center
生活中很多可怕事情的中心
of so many terrible aspects of life
即成瘾和某些形式的精神疾病
namely addiction and certain forms of mental disease.
因此  如果在神经科学领域有什么双刃剑
So if ever there was a double-edged blade
那就是多巴胺
in the world of neuroscience it's dopamine.
那么我们来谈谈多巴胺是什么
So let's talk about what dopamine is
和往常一样  我们将要谈
and as always we are going to talk
一些可行的工具方法
about actionable tools today.
我们肯定会谈论
We're definitely gonna talk about
一些与补剂有关的东西
some things related to supplementation.
虽然你可能会惊讶于
Although you might be surprised to learn
不仅仅是增加多巴胺
that it's not all just about increasing dopamine
特别是在某些情况下
and in particular, in some cases
盲目增加多巴胺是不对的
that's the wrong thing to do.
有时是合适的  有时不是
Sometimes it's appropriate sometimes it's not.
还有  所以我们将讨论相关的工具
More so we're going to talk about tools related
所谓的多巴胺调度
to what's called dopamine scheduling, how
你 如何过生活
the way that you're leading your life
以及概念化目标的方式
and the way that you're conceptualizing your goals
实际上可以被预测
can actually predict whether
比如你是否将继续追求这些目标
or not you're going to continue to pursue those goals.
然后
And therefore whether
你是否将成功实现这些目标
or not you will succeed in achieving those goals
以及你是否会退出
As well as whether or not you will quit.
两者之间有一个基本的关系
There's a fundamental relationship between
多巴胺在你的大脑中释放
dopamine released in your brain
和你付出努​​力的愿望
and your desire to exert effort.
你实际上可以控制
And you can actually control the schedule
多巴胺释放的时间表
of dopamine release
但这需要适当的知识
but it requires the appropriate knowledge.
这是其中一种情况
This is one of those cases where
了解多巴胺系统的工作方式
understanding the way the dopamine system works
将使你能够从中受益
will allow you to leverage it to your benefit.
如果你不了解多巴胺的工作方式
And if you don't understand the way that dopamine works
很有可能会发生
there's a good chance that it's going
你只能随波逐流
to pull you out into the current of life.
意味着世界中其他的因素  事物
Meaning the rest of the world is going
会来控制你释放多巴胺的时间表
to control your dopamine schedules.
因此  很高兴告诉你有关今天的信息
So I'm excited to tell you about today's information.
你将学习一些基础科学
You're gonna learn some basic science.
你将学到很多工具
You're gonna learn a lot of tools
我认为这些工具都适用
and these tools I believe are applicable
不管你是五岁的小孩
whether or not you're five years old
八岁  八十岁  或者任何年龄
eight years old, 80 years older, anything in between.
因此  让我们谈谈多巴胺
So let's talk about dopamine.
让我们来了解一些基本事实
Let's get a few basic facts on the table.
多巴胺在1950年代后期被发现
Dopamine was discovered in the late 1950s
它被发现为前体物  意思就是说
and it was discovered as the precursor, meaning the thing
制成肾上腺素或肾上腺素的前体化学物
from which epinephrin or adrenaline is made.
这非常重要
Now that's fundamentally important
因为这个分子我们现在称为多巴胺
because this molecule we call dopamine nowadays,
我们认为是奖励和愉悦的分子
we think of as the molecule of reward and pleasure,
但实际上是
but actually it is the substrate
制造肾上腺素的原料  而且在大脑中
from which adrenaline is made and in the brain
也是脑部肾上腺素的原料
it's the substrate from which epinephrin is
脑部和腺体的肾上腺素是一回事
made epinephrin is the same thing as adrenaline
只是在大脑中  我们称其为肾上腺素
except in the brain we call it epinephrin.
你可能还记得以前的播客中的肾上腺素
Epinephrin as you may recall from previous podcasts,
如果你记得  没问题  肾上腺素
or if you haven't no problem epinephrin
使我们能够采取行动
allows us to get into action.
它刺激心脏血管的变化
It stimulates changes in the blood vessels, in the heart
在器官和组织中
in the organs and tissues
让我们的身体偏向于运动
of the body that bias us for movement.
如果你想进一步了解肾上腺素
And if you'd like to learn more about epinephrin
你可以看一下有关控制压力的一集
you can check out our episode on mastering stress.
我们在那里谈论很多
We talk a lot about it there.
最初认为多巴胺只是
Dopamine was initially thought to be just
肾上腺素的基础
the building block for epinephrin.
确实是制成肾上腺素化学物质的基石
And it is indeed the chemical building block from which epinephrin is made.
但是  多巴胺可以独立完成许多工作
However, dopamine does a lot of things on its own.
它并不总是转化为肾上腺素
It's not always converted to epinephrin.
多巴胺从多个部位释放
Dopamine is released from several sites
存在与大脑和身体中  但也许是最重要的一个
in the brain and body, but perhaps the most important one
今天关于动机和奖励的讨论
for today's discussion about motivation
有时只是
and reward is something that sometimes just
称为“奖励通路”
called the reward pathway
给感兴趣的人补充一下  它有时被称为
for the aficionado it's sometimes called
中脑边缘的奖赏通路
the mesolimbic reward pathway
但这从根本上来说很重要
but it's fundamentally important
让你渴望采取行动
to your desire to engage in action
这还从另一个方面根本上来说很重要
and it's fundamentally important
就是使人们沉迷于物质或行为
for people getting addicted to substances or behaviors.
那么这是如何工作的呢？
So how does this work?
好  你有一个结构
Well, you've got a structure
在大脑深处称为VTA
in the deep part of your brain called the VTA.
它表示“蔡氏腹侧被盖区”
It stands for ventral tegmental area.
与往常一样  你不必记住这些名称
As always you don't have to remember these names,
但是如果你愿意  我会把它们提供给你
but if you want to I offer them to you for food
方便你进一步谷歌搜索  研究  阅读等
further googling, research, reading, et cetera,
VTA或腹侧被盖区包含的神经元
the VTA or ventral tegmental area contains neurons that
发送我们称为轴突的小导线  吐出多巴胺
send what we call axons little wires that spit out dopamine
在另一种结构称为伏核
at a different structure called the nucleus accumbens
VTA和伏隔核的两个结构
and those two structures VTA and nucleus accumbens form
确实是奖赏通路的核心机制
really the core machinery of the reward pathway
以及控制你任何事物动力的途径
and the pathway that controls your motivation
你可以将它们视为加速器
for anything you can think of them like an accelerator
他们让你倾向于采取行动
they bias you for action.
但是  在奖赏通路中  还有一个刹车
However, within the reward pathway, there's also a break
会对多巴胺进行破坏或限制
the break or restriction on that dopamine
控制多巴胺何时释放
which controls when it's released
以及释放多少  就是前额叶皮层
and how much it's released is the prefrontal cortex.
前额叶皮层是神经不动产
The prefrontal cortex is the neural real estate right
在额头后面
behind your forehead.
讨论了神经科学的许多方面
It's discussed for so many aspects of neuroscience.
你会听到有关决策的信息
You hear about it for decision-making ,
执行功能  用于计划等
executive function ,for planning, et cetera.
实际上  这是其中很多原因的原因
And indeed it's responsible for a lot of those.
这是真正独特的资产
It's this really unique real estate
我们都被赋予了人类的本分
that we were all endowed with as humans,
其他动物没有太多这种神经
other animals don't have much of it.
而我们有很多
We have a lot of it
而前额叶皮层起作用
and that prefrontal cortex acts
作为多巴胺系统的刹车
as a brake on the dopamine system
没有那样的刹车系统  你将变成一种
without that break you would be purely
纯粹寻求乐趣的动物
a pleasure seeking animal.
你将纯粹是寻求乐趣
You would be purely pleasure seeking.
你将没有任何依据来规范自己的行为
You would have no basis for regulating your behavior
在那些让自己感觉良好的事情上
in terms of trying to get things that make you feel good.
这将我们带到了  动机的一个重要特征面前
And that brings us to the important feature of motivation
动机是一个分为两个部分的过程
which is that motivation is a two-part process
这是关于平衡快乐与痛苦
which is about balancing pleasure and pain.
大多数人都在考虑动力
Okay. Most people think about motivation
奖励和多巴胺只是试图获得快乐
and reward and dopamine is just trying to achieve pleasure.
确实释放了多巴胺
And indeed dopamine is released
当我们体验到自己喜欢的事物时
in the brain from the VTA at the* nucleus accumbens.
多巴胺从VTA中 在大脑中  在伏核中释放
When we experience things that we like.
所以这是将其概念化的方法
So here's the way to conceptualize this
如果你可以将其内在化
and if you can internalize this in your mind
它将在你的生活中真正为你提供帮助
it will really help you as you move through your day
你可以了解自己为什么会受到激励
trying to understand why you might be motivated
或对某些事情没有动力
or not motivated for certain things.
因此  当你坐在那里时  没有在做太多事情
So when you're just sitting around, not doing much
也许你早上醒来就在床上
of anything, maybe you wake up in bed in the morning.
你正在考虑是否要起床
You're thinking about getting up or not.
这种奖赏通路正在释放多巴胺
This reward pathway is releasing dopamine
以每秒约三到四次的速度
at a rate of about three or four times per second.
这是一种低水平的“发射”
It's kind of firing in a low level.
当我说“发射”的时候  意思是神经元有电活动
When I say firing me an electrical activity in the neurons.
所以当你没什么事情  你会感觉很好  而不是沮丧
So when you're just around, you feel okay, not depressed
没有上进心  没有激动
not highly motivated, not excited
也许每秒三四次
maybe three or four times a second.
如果突然之间你对某件事感到兴奋
If suddenly you get excited about something
你期待某事  却未获得任何奖励
you anticipate something, not receive an award
但你会以预期到结果的方式感到兴奋
but you get excited in an anticipatory way.
然后发射率  活动率
Then the rate of firing the rate of activity
在这个奖赏通路中突然增加
in this reward pathway suddenly increases
大概到每秒30或40次
to like 30 or 40 times
它具有创造一种
and it has the effect of creating a sense
行动或渴望移动感觉的效果
of action or desire to move
朝着你渴望的方向发展
in the direction of the thing that you're craving.
实际上  可以说多巴胺是
In fact, it's fair to say that dopamine is responsible
为了匮乏和渴望负责任的化学物质
for wanting and for craving,
这与你平时听到它被谈论的内容
and that's distinctly different
是截然不同的
from the way that you hear it talked about normally
一般都说它涉及到乐趣
which is that it's involved in pleasure.
因此  没错  多巴胺随着姓生活释放
So yes, dopamine is released in response to sex.
响应食物时释放
It's released in response to food.
释放它是为了回应很多事情
It's released in response to a lot of things
但大部分释放是因为预期某件事
but it's mostly released in anticipation
渴望某件事
and craving for a particular thing.
它的作用是缩小我们关注范围
It has the effect of narrowing our focus
让我们只关注渴望的事情
for the thing that we crave
那件事可能像喝杯咖啡一样简单
and that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee.
这可能与一次大型董事会会议一样重要
It could be as important as a big board meeting.
这可能是一个很大的期末考试
It could be a big, final exam.
可能是一个我们很高兴认识的人
It could be a, the person that we're excited to meet
多巴胺不在乎你的渴望
or see dopamine doesn't care about what you're craving.
它只是以特定的速率释放
It just releases at a particular rate.
实际上  如果我们退后一步
In fact, if we just take a step back
我们看一下科学数据
and we look at the scientific data
多巴胺释放增加了多少
on how much the dopamine firing increases in response
对待处理不同的事情  你会得到一个非常有趣的
to different things, you get a pretty interesting window
关于大脑的运作方式的窗口
into how your brain works
以及为什么你会受到激励或没有激励
and why you might be motivated or not motivated.
假设你饿了  或者你很期待
Let's say you're hungry, or you're looking forward
一杯咖啡  或者你将去见伴侣
to a cup of coffee, or you're going to see your partner.
好吧  你的多巴胺神经元一开始的放电速度很慢
Well, your dopamine neurons are firing at a low rate
直到你开始考虑想要的东西
until you start thinking about the thing that you want
或你期待的东西
or the thing that you're looking forward to
假设你想吃巧克力
let's say you're craving chocolate
或一顿美餐  一块牛排
or a good meal, a steak
如果你喜欢牛排或一盘美味的意大利面
if you like steak or a nice plate of pasta
如果你喜欢意大利面  当你吃那食物时
if you like pasta, when you eat that food
释放的多巴胺量
the amount of dopamine that's released
在这个奖赏通路中  比基线高出约50％
in this reward pathway goes up about 50% above baseline.
那里的神经元从
The neurons there go from firing,
每秒三到四次开始
three or four times per second to,
到每秒六到十次
six or 10 times per second.
真的要看情况
It really depends
这些不是确切的数字
and these aren't exact numbers.
但是如果我们要测量数量
But if we were to measure the amount
释放的多巴胺
of dopamine that's released, it goes
上升约50点
up about 50 points, all right.
性  这是根本的
Sex, which is fundamental
我们的物种的根本需求  延续和繁殖
to our species, continuation and reproduction.
尽管不一定是为了怀上孩子
Although it doesn't have to be for conceiving children.
性行为确实会释放多巴胺
Sex does release dopamine
它会使多巴胺水平提高约100％
and it increases dopamine levels about a hundred percent.
因此基本上使它们加倍
So basically doubles them.
香烟中的尼古丁
Nicotine of the sort that's in cigarettes
或有些人正在服用尼古丁补剂
or some people are taking nicotine
服用这些补剂
in supplemental form increases the amount
多巴胺比基线高约150％
of dopamine about 150% above baseline.
它还做一些我们之后会谈到的其他事情
It also does some other things that we're gonna
但是尼古丁疯狂提高多巴胺水平
talk about, but nicotine does that
这很有趣
and it's kind of interesting
尼古丁会增加你大脑中的多巴胺
that nicotine would increase the amount
几秒钟之内就能很快地增加
of dopamine in your brain very quick, within seconds
这是提高了150倍以上
that's 150 times over baseline as opposed to sex
性行为提高了100％  食物提高了50％
which is a 100 percent above or food which is 50%.
可卡因和苯丙胺增加量
Cocaine and amphetamine increase the amount
释放了一千倍的多巴胺
of dopamine that's released a thousand fold
在服用药物后约10秒钟内
within about 10 seconds of consuming the drug.
但是  只要考虑食物
However, just thinking about food,
关于性  关于尼古丁
about sex, about nicotine
如果你喜欢尼古丁或可卡因
if you like nicotine or cocaine
或苯丙胺可以增加量
or amphetamine can increase the amount
释放的多巴胺
of dopamine that's released
达到与实际吃到那个东西  释放的相同程度
to the same degree as actually consuming the drug.
取决于某些情况  例如
Now it depends in some cases, for instance
可卡因使用者  想要可卡因的瘾君子
the cocaine user, the addict that wants cocaine
不能只考虑可卡因
can't just think about cocaine and increase
释放的数量大约一千倍
the amount of that's released about a thousand
实际上要低得多
fold is actually much lower
但这足以使他们走上被激发的道路
but it's just enough to put them on the motivation track
因为他渴望那个特别的东西
for it to crave that particular thing.
你有理由会
Now, there are reasons why you would
有这样的大脑回路
have brain circuitry like this.
我的意思是说大脑回路
I mean, brain circuitry
这样不会演变成让你上瘾
like this didn't evolve to get you addicted
像这样的大脑通路进化
brain circuitry like this evolved
是为了激励行为
in order to motivate behaviors
朝着特定目标迈进
toward particular goals,
口渴时喝水
water when you're thirsty ,
性是为了繁殖
sex in order to reproduce
我们将谈论这种关系
and we're gonna talk about the relationship
雌激素和睾丸激素与多巴胺系统之间
between estrogen and testosterone and the dopamine system
因为那些激素实际上
because those hormones actually
偏向多巴胺释放
bias dopamine to be released.
这些东西和神经元的这些大脑区域
These things and these brain areas in neurons
是导致人类进化的历史的一部分
were part of the evolutionary history that led
让我们物种的延续
to the continuation of our species.
可卡因和安非他明之类的
Things like cocaine and amphetamine are disastrous
对于大多数人来说是灾难  因为它们的多巴胺真的很多
for most people because they really so much dopamine
它们创造了这些封闭的循环
and they create these closed loops where people
然后让人只渴望特定的东西  可卡因  苯丙胺
then only crave the particular thing, cocaine, amphetamine
导致大量的多巴胺释放
that leads to those massive amounts of dopamine release.
大多数事情不会释放出多巴胺水平
Most things don't release that level of dopamine.
现在有很多
Now, nowadays there's a ton
对社交媒体和视频游戏的兴趣
of interest in social media and in video games
确实进行了一些测量
and there have been some measurements
关于多巴胺的释放   视频游戏
of the amount of dopamine released video games
特别是电子游戏  更新率很高
especially video games have a very high update
始终保持新颖领域的速度
speed where there's novel territory all the time
新颖是多巴胺的一大刺激
not novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine.
那些可以在刺激释放多巴胺
Those can release dopamine somewhere
其程度介于尼古丁和可卡因之间
between nicotine and cocaine.
因此  多巴胺的释放量很高
So very high levels of dopamine release.
社交媒体是一个有趣的
Social media is an interesting one
因为多巴胺的量
because the amount of dopamine
随着登录社交平台的时间而变化
that's released in response to logging
最初在社交媒体上的多巴胺释放可能会很高
onto social media initially could be quite high
但似乎随着登陆的越多  有逐渐减少的趋势
but it seems like likely that there's a taper in the amount
但人们仍然上瘾
of dopamine and yet people still get addicted.
那么为什么  为什么我们会上瘾
So why, why is it that we can get addicted
对那些逐渐减少获得多巴胺量的东西
to things that fail to get
明明与最初相比
to elicit the same massive amount
减少了很多
of pleasure that they initially did.
沉迷于某事不只是关于
Being addicted to something isn't just about
感觉很好的事实
the fact that it feels so good
你想一遍又一遍地做
that you wanna do it over and over again
那是因为这种愉悦的痛苦平衡
and that's because of this pleasure pain balance
这是动力的基础
that underlies motivation.
所以让我们再仔细讲一点
So let's look a little bit closer
有关愉悦和痛苦的平衡
at the pleasure pain balance because
因为其中蕴含着一些工具和方法
there in lies the tools
让你能够控制动力
for you to be able to control motivation
朝着健康的事物发展  并避免那些
toward healthy things and avoid motivated behaviors
对具有破坏性的事情产生动机的行为
towards things that are destructive for you.
人们尝试新颖的行为
There are a lot of reasons why
有很多原因
people try novel behaviors
不管这些是drugs还是
whether or not those are drugs or
不管是冒险
whether or not those are adventure,
寻求刺激的事物  或者他们寻找新的伴侣
thrill-seeking things or they seek out new partners
他们上了一堂新课  你会注意到
they take a new class as you'll notice.
我对这些行为没有任何评判
I'm not placing any judgment
也没有去定义它们
or value on these different behaviors.
虽然我认为公平来讲
Although I think it's fair to point
对大多数人来说  成瘾性药物
out that for most people addictive drugs
像可卡因和安非他命一样具有破坏性
like cocaine and amphetamine are very destructive.
其实我们知道大约15%
Actually we know that about 15
到20％的人有遗传倾向
to 20% of people have a genetic bias
更容易上瘾  有时你会听到
towards addiction , you sometimes hear
第一次使用毒品
that the first time that you use a drug
你可能会沉迷于此
you can become addicted to it.
实际上  对于大多数事情而言  事实并非如此
That's actually not been shown to be true for most things
在大多数人中  但对于某些人而言  这确实是正确的
in most people, but for some people that actually is true.
我们稍后再讨论为什么
And we'll talk a little bit later about why
某些人在首次使用某种药物时
certain people are heavily biased toward becoming addicts
就很容易成为瘾君子
on the first use of a particular drug.
其实很有趣
It's actually very interesting,
它与是否
it has everything to do with whether
他们以前是否沉迷于其他东西
or not they were formerly addicted to something else
但无论如何  成瘾的工作方式
but in any case, the way that addiction works
以及动机的整体运作方式
and the way that motivation works generally
在非成瘾的环境中
in the non-addictive setting is
是当你期待某事时
that when you anticipate something
释放出少量的多巴胺  然后
a little bit of dopamine is released, and then
当你到达那个东西时  你参与进入那个东西
when you reach that thing, you're engaged in that thing
多巴胺的量甚至进一步增加
the amount of dopamine goes up even further
但是当你反复追求某种行为时
but as you repeatedly pursue a behavior
然后你反复从事某件事
and you repeatedly engage with a particular thing
假设你喜欢跑步
let's say you love running
或者你喜欢巧克力  因为你吃一块巧克力
or you love chocolate as you eat a piece of chocolate
真的  味道很好
believe it or not, it tastes good
然后从多巴胺的活化开始转移
and then there's a shift away from activation of dopamine.
还有其他释放出来的化学物质
And there are other chemicals that are released
引发低水平的痛苦感
that trigger a low level sense of pain.
现在你可能不会感觉到身体上的痛苦
Now you might not feel it as physical pain
但是你感到的渴望
but the craving that you feel
都是多巴胺的一部分
is both one part dopamine
另一部分是多巴胺的反面
and one part, the mirror image of dopamine
也就是痛苦
which is the pain
或不想再来一块巧克力
or the craving for yet another piece of chocolate.
这是非常重要的
And this is a very important
和多巴胺系统的微妙特征
and subtle feature of the dopamine system.
很少被讨论
That's not often discussed.
人们总是谈论快乐
People always talk about just as pleasure.
你喜欢社交媒体
You love social media.
所以它给你多巴胺  因此  你反复参与其中
So it gives you dopamine. And so you engage in that.
你喜欢巧克力  它会释放多巴胺
You like chocolate, it releases dopamine.
所以你一直吃
So you do that.
但是对于释放的多巴胺的每一点
But for every bit of dopamine that's released
还有另一条通路
there's another circuit
在创造你的大脑中...
in the brain that creates you can think
这有点像愉悦感的下降
of it as kind of like a downward deflection in pleasure.
所以你从事真正想要的事情
So you engage in something you really want
并且乐趣增加了
and there's an increase in pleasure.
然后你没有做任何事情
And then without you doing anything
有一个镜像
there's a mirror image of that
是愉悦感的向下偏移
which is a downward deflection in pleasure
我们称之为痛苦
which we're calling pain.
因此  尽享每一个快乐
So for every bit of pleasure
有镜象体验  痛苦
there is a mirror image experience
它们在时间上重叠得非常紧密
of pain and they overlap in time very closely.
所以有时候很难感觉到这一点
So it's sometimes hard to sense this
但是下次你吃的东西真的很好吃时  请尝试一下
but try it the next time you eat something really delicious.
你会咬一口
You'll take a bite,
尝起来很美味
it tastes delicious
经验的一部分就是想要更多的东西
and part of the experience is to want more of that thing.
任何愉快的经历都是如此
This is true for any pleasureful experience.
关于多巴胺的恶魔化部分是
Now, the diabolical part about dopamine is that
因为它的进化  并不是为了让你沉迷于
because it didn't evolve in order to get you to indulge
在越来越多的事物中  实际发生的是
in more and more and more of something, what happens is
最初  你会感到愉悦
that initially you experience an increase in pleasure
而且你也经历了这种
and you also experience this increase
不久之后痛苦的增长  与快乐交织在一起
in pain shortly after or woven in
快乐让你想要更多的东西
with the pleasure that makes you want more of that thing.
但是随后的每一次
But with each subsequent time
你遇到那件事
that you encounter that thing
你追求的巧克力
that you pursue, the chocolate that
你追逐的情人  每次
you pursue the lover each time, the experience
体验多巴胺的释放和愉悦感会有所降低
of dopamine release and pleasure is diminished a little bit.
特别可恶的事情就是
And the diabolical thing is
痛苦反应有所增加
that the pain response is increased a little bit
在寻求毒品这个行为中
and this is best observed
可以最好地证明这一点
in the context of drug seeking behavior.
第一次有人决定服用可卡因
The first time someone decides to take cocaine
或苯丙胺  他们可能出于无聊而这样做
or amphetamine, they may do it out of boredom.
他们可能会因为同伴压力而这样做
They may do it out of peer pressure.
他们可能这样做是为了减轻一些内在的感觉
They may do it to relieve some internal sense.
也许他们很无聊  或者他们只是兴奋
Maybe they're bored, or they're just excited.
也许他们对新奇事物的追求很高
Maybe they're high in novel novelty seeking.
人们有很多原因去尝试毒品
There are a lot of reasons why people
实在是太多了
might try a drug far too many for us
这里我们讲不完
to get into our parks here.
也许他们甚至不想吃
Maybe they don't even wanna do it
但是有人在一旁煽动他们
but someone encourages them.
他们将经历大量的多巴胺释放
They will experience a huge dopamine release
他们会感觉很好
and they will feel likely very good.
但是  下次他们服用时
However, the next time they take it
感觉不会那么好
it won't feel quite as good.
而且第三次感觉也不会很好
And it won't feel even as good the third time
或第四次  但痛苦的程度
or the next time, but the amount of pain
他们渴望的药物量
the amount of craving that they experience
会随着时间增加
for the drug will increase over time.
我们追求快乐的大部分情况
So much of our pursuit of pleasure
仅仅是为了减轻渴望的痛苦
is simply to reduce the pain of craving.
因此  下次你体验到一些东西时
So the next time you experienced something,
假设你真的很喜欢
you really like I don't wanna
我不想带你摆脱那种经历
take you out of that experience
但是注意这一点非常重要
but it's really important that you notice this
如果你真的很喜欢
that if there's something you really enjoy
这种享受的一部分是
part of that enjoyment is
关于更多的东西的期望和缺乏
about the anticipation and wanting of more of that thing
这就是行动中的痛苦系统
and that's the pain system in action.
这样我们就可以区分多巴胺
And so we can distinguish between dopamine
这真的是带来快乐
which is really about pleasure and dopamine
多巴胺实际上让我们追求更多动力的动力
which is really about motivation to pursue more
为了减轻或排除将来的痛苦
in order to relieve or exclude future pain.
让我重复一遍
Let me repeat that.
多巴胺与享乐并没有那么多
Dopamine isn't as much about pleasure, as much
因为它是关于动力和追求更多的愿望
as it is about motivation and desire to pursue more
为了减轻痛苦
in order to reduce the amount of pain
现在我们在谈论痛苦
and we are now talking about pain
作为一种心理上的痛苦和渴望
as a psychological pain and a craving
虽然很想念情人的人
although people that miss a lover very badly
或真的非常渴望食物
or that really crave a food very badly,
或沉迷于药物但无法使用
or that are addicted to a drug and can't access,
都会体会到这种渴望
it will experience that as a physical craving
以及精神上的渴望
and a mental craving the body and brain
身体和大脑以这种方式链接
are linked in this way.
几乎  他们会将其描述为痛苦的
It's almost, they'll describe it as painful.
他们渴求
They yearn for it.
我认为“渴望”一词非常有价值
And I think the word yearning is one that's very valuable
在这种情况下  因为渴望似乎
in this context, because yearning seems to
包括了全身体验  而不仅仅是想要
include a whole body experience more than just wanting
想要可能只是在脑海中浮现
which could just be up in the mind.
所以你对某事的渴望是成比例的
So your desire for something is proportional
沉迷于那件事有多快乐
to how pleasureful it is to indulge in that thing
以及你无法得到它时有多少痛苦
but also how much pain you experience when
两者成比例关系
you don't have it.
你可以开始让自己去想想看
And you can now start to let your mind wander
各种成瘾的例子
into all sorts of examples of addictions
或你碰巧喜欢的事情
or things that you happen to like,
我将使用有时在这里使用的示例
I'll use the example that I sometimes use on here
这是我对牛角面包的热爱
which is my love of croissants.
尽管你们当中有人指出
Although several of you pointed out
这叫做可颂
these are called croissant
但这听起来像是我在说法语
but then it sounds like I'm trying to speak French
我小时候总是尝试这样做
and I always tried to do that when I was a kid
我去了一所双语学校  但失败了
and I went to a bilingual school and it failed
当然现在也会失败
then it's gonna fail now.
所以我要称它们为牛角包
So I'm gonna call them croissants.
非常好吃
They're delicious.
我爱它们  一种非常好的食物  使我想吃六个
I love them a really good one makes me wanna eat six.
这是真的
It's true.
我认为我的冲动控制能力很好
I have pretty good impulse control, I think
但这让我想吃六个
but it makes me wanna eat six.
我尝了  很香
I taste it and it tastes so delicious
除非我真的强迫自己去体验
and unless I really force myself to experience
它在我嘴里的味道
the taste of it in my mouth
以及我现在多么饿
and how flaky I'm getting hungry for it right now
美味的牛角面包主要是味道
and delicious the croissant is mostly the tastes
那个牛角包的味道  让我想吃更多的牛角包
of that croissant makes me want to eat more croissants.
最终血糖上升
Now, eventually blood sugar goes up
达到饱腹感  等等
satiety is reached, et cetera.
那会发生什么呢？
What happens then?
什么是满足感和饱足感？
What is satisfaction and satiety about?
好吧  那是一个单独的神经调节剂
Well, that's a separate neuromodulator.
那是关于神经调节剂血清素
That's about the neuromodulator serotonin.
还有催产素
It's about oxytocin.
这是与激素系统有关的
It's about a hormone system that involves something
叫做催乳素
called prolactin.
所以我们要谈论
So we're gonna talk about
所有这些  都在一本书里
all of those in the book
《the Molecule of More》 一本精彩著作
"the Molecule of More" wonderful book
那些被描述为现在和现在的分子
those were described as the here and now molecules
那些让你体验到自己的感觉的人
the ones that allow you to experience your sensations
当下的快乐
and pleasure in the present
并且大脑不再向未来投射
and for which the brain stops projecting into the future.
所以现在让我们谈谈渴望
So now let's talk about craving
这些所谓的时空分子
and these so-called here and now molecules
以及那些人如何参与
and how those engage in a kind
的推拉平衡  这将使你不
of push pull balance that will allow you to not
只是觉得自己更有动力  还喜欢享受事物
just feel more motivated, but also to enjoy the things
在生活中你追求的程度更高
in life that you are pursuing to a much greater degree.
我们在一个区域有神经元
We have neurons in an area
我们的大脑被称为Raphe RAPHE
of our brain called the raphe R-A-P-H-E
Raphe释放血清素
The raphe releases serotonin
在大脑的不同地方
at different places in the brain.
血清素是幸福的分子
Serotonin is the molecule of bliss
满足于你已经拥有的东西
and contentment for what you already have.
我之前谈到过外部感受
I've talked before about exteroception,
外部感受是对外界的关注
exteroception is a focus on the outside world,
皮肤以外的一切
everything beyond the confines of your skin.
我也谈到了注意力的互感
I've also talked about interoception of focus
内部发生的事情
on things that are happening internally
在你的皮肤包裹范围内
within the confines of your skin.
可以认为多巴胺和血清素
Dopamine and serotonin can be thought
与外部感受有关
of as related to extra reception.
多巴胺使我们专注于外部事物
Dopamine makes us focused on things outside us
这超出了我们所谓的个人空间
that are beyond what we call our personal space
我们实际上必须进行一些活动
where we actually have to move
并采取行动以实现目标
and take action in order to achieve things
和血清素一般与
and serotonin in general has to do with
我们现在手边立即发生的事情有关
the things that are in our immediate here and now,
因此它被称为
hence the description
现在/当下的分子
of these as the here and now molecules.
所以有趣的是指出身体
So it's interesting to point out that the body
大脑可以引导注意力
and the brain can direct its attention
面向我们外部或内部的事物
towards things outside us or inside us
或将我们的注意力分散在这些之间
or split our attention between those.
我在上一个播客中谈到了这一点
I talked about this in a previous podcast
但是  如果你没有看到它  也没问题
but if you didn't see it, no problem.
只要了解多巴胺会使我们产生偏见
Just understand that dopamine biases us
去思考我们所没有的
toward thinking about what we don't have,
而血清素和一些相关分子
whereas serotonin and some of the related molecules
像是内源性大麻素
like the endocannabinoids if you picked up on
大麻素这个词  没错  就像大麻
the word cannabinoid, yes it's like cannabis
因为大麻依附于内源性大麻素受体
because cannabis attaches to endocannabinoids receptors
而内源性大麻素是
and the endocannabinoids are receptors that
和化学物质  你的大麻素
and chemicals that the cannabinoids that you
很自然地让他们参与到诸如遗忘之类的事情中
naturally make that are involved in things like forgetting.
这不是巧合
It's not a coincidence
那些抽烟的人不会有最可怕的记忆
that pot smokers don't have the most terrific memory.
你可能知道一些有美好回忆的人
You may know a few that have great memories
但多数情况下  他们更有可能会有更好的记忆
but chances are, they would have even better memories
如果他们不是抽烟的人
if they weren't pot smokers
但是你让这些分子
but you make these molecules that bind
与让你感到幸福的受体结合
to these receptors that make you feel kinda blissed
都是在当下 立刻
out and content in the present.
这些是我们中存在的受体
Those are receptors that exist in us
不是为了食用四氢大麻酚或大麻  而是
not for sake of consuming THC or marijuana, but
为了结合我们天然的内源性大麻素
for sake of binding of our natural endogenous cannabinoids.
所以你有这两个系统
So you've got these two systems
他们有点像推拉
they're kind of like a push pull
如果你想说一本书
and if you were to say in the book
《正念：此刻是一枝花》  是乔·卡巴·金（Jon Kabat-Zinn）写的
or wherever you go there you are Jon Kabat-Zinn talks
关于这种冥想练习
about this meditation practice.
这与大多数冥想练习不同
That's different than most meditation practices
你吃一个杏仁
where you eat one almond
然后把所有的注意力都集中在杏仁上
and you focus all of your attention on the almond
杏仁的味道  杏仁的质地
the taste of the almond, the texture of the almond.
那真的是一种正念练习
That's really a mindfulness practice
旨在尝试采取一种行为
that's geared towards trying to take a behavior
通常是追求  通常是喂养
which is normally about pursuit, normally feeding
因为我们要因为多巴胺而进食
as we were going to engage in feeding because of dopamine
我们追求更多的食物
we pursue more of a food
因为那种我之前讲过的愉悦和痛苦关系
because of that pleasure pain relationship
注意力放在一个杏仁上
I talked about before the focus on the one almond
或变得非常非常注重当下
or becoming very present
通常是将一种额外追求的行为
in any behavior that normally would be a kind
转变为一种
of extra susceptive pursuit behavior
专注于当下的行为
and bring it into the here
这就是正念群体真正簇拥的一个概念
and now that's a mental trick or a mental task
也就是精神上的一种方法  一种任务
that the mindfulness community has really embraced
为了尝试
in order to try
从你已经拥有的东西中  产生乐趣
and create increased pleasure for what you already have.
这其实是在努力实现转变
It's really trying to accomplish a shift
从多巴胺释放转变为
from dopamine being released to serotonin
在大麻素系统中血清素的释放  在你练习冥想之后
in the cannabinoid system, being involved in that behavior.
因此  如果你对正念感兴趣
So if you're interested in mindfulness
这是我之前在本播客中谈到的
which is something I've talked about before in this podcast
我有点开玩笑的笑话
and I sort of made some off the cuff jokes
关于正念的对立面是无意识
about the opposite of mindfulness being mindlessness.
正念是广阔的空间
Mindfulness is a vast space
那是就是正念练习
that is a mindful practice that a lot
很多人都在练习
of people have engaged in.
确实可以给你
And indeed it can give you deeper appreciation
对于已经拥有的东西更深刻的欣赏
for things that you already have.
多巴胺有
Dopamine has the quality
让人们疯狂地追求事物的作用
of making people kind of rabidly in pursuit of things.
看那些嗨的人
Look at people who are high
吸食可卡因或苯丙胺
on cocaine or amphetamine, and they are almost
他们就完全是外部接受  药物  例如大麻  阿片类药物
entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, the opioids
任何真正打击血清素系统的东西
anything that really hits the serotonin system hard
倾向于使人变得昏昏欲睡
tend to make people rather lethargic
和满足于保持原样的位置
and content to stay exactly where they are.
他们根本不想追求太多
They don't wanna pursue much at all.
偶尔当人们抽大麻或食用四氢大麻酚时
Occasionally when people smoke marijuana or consume THC
他们的胃口越来越大
their appetite goes way up
他们真的很想吃食物
and they really wanna consume food.
那是因为它对胰岛素的作用及其对血糖的作用
That's because of its effects on insulin and its effects
这是一个稍微分开的问题
on blood sugar, which is a slightly separate matter.
但是由于你们中的一些人  也许你关心这些
But since some of you, probably your minds
可能有过那些经历
might've gone to those either experiences
或看过有关大麻作用的报告  这就是为什么会产生这种影响的原因
or reports of what pot does, that's why it does that.
所以你有这些分子
So you've got these molecules
像多巴胺  让你专注
like dopamine that make you focused
关于你想要的东西和你渴望的东西
on the things you want and the things you crave.
然后你有了使你满足的分子
And then you've got the molecules that make you content
与你所拥有的
with what you have.
所以最重要的事情  也许是在创造健康
So the most important thing, perhaps in creating a healthy
情感环境是要保持平衡
emotional landscape is to have a balance
在这两个神经调节系统之间
between these two neuromodulator systems
总是期待的人
people that are always in anticipation
有欲望和追求  对于追求目标而言是很棒的
and desire and seeking that's wonderful for pursuing goals.
但是  对于想要享受生活来说太糟糕了
However, it's terrible for enjoying life
那些人其实很
and actually those people are actually quite
难以相处
difficult to be around.
有一定的  几乎是社会性的因素
There's a certain, almost sociopathic element
给所谓的多巴胺能亢进的人
to people who are what they call hyper dopaminergic.
总是处于多巴胺能水平的人
People who are always on the dopaminergic scale
到他们一直追求目标的地步
to the point where they are always pursuing goals.
实际上  这些人被称为
In fact, those people are known to be
至少在心理方面
at least in the psychological spectrum.
他们可以是非常具有操纵性的   多巴胺
They can be very manipulative dopamine
追求某件事并不一定
and the pursuit of something doesn't necessarily
必须是高能量和高强度的
have to be high energy and intense from the outside.
当你从外面观察时
When you observe it from the outside.
实际上  有些人会操纵
In fact, there are people who will manipulate
为了得到他们想要的
in order to get what they want.
这表明他们都具有高水平的多巴胺释放
This has been shown who have high levels of dopamine release
但是他们已经学到了一种
in their brain, but they've learned that a kind
被动操纵是最好的操纵方式
of passive manipulation is the best way to maneuver
在特定的环境中
through a particular environment.
我不想太关注
I don't wanna focus too much
这种社会病  因为这些都是极端的例子
on sociopathy because those are kind of extreme examples
但这只是一些表明确定目标的人
but it just goes to show that people who identify a goal
并意识到他们需要采取的一系列步骤
and realize the series of steps that they need to take
为了实现这个目标
in order to achieve that goal can either do it
他们会通过道德手段或非道德手段
through ethical means or non ethical means they can do it
他们会积极的追求
through active pursuit, being the kind
成为那种总是大声宣称自己目标的人
of type a person that's always declaring their goals
把目标发在Instagram上
and going after it, posting it on Instagram
告诉每个人 让其他人来监督
telling everybody about it, try and recruit others.
有那种表型
There's that phenotype
有那种多巴胺的特征
there's that kind of signature of dopamine
然后有些人
and then there are the people that wanna
他们如果要得到他们想要的
get what they want, and they're doing it
就是始终为他人服务
by always serving other people
时刻照顾其他人的需求
by always taking care of everybody else's needs
试图实现自己的目标的时候
by always trying to accomplish their goals
但至少通过一种
but through a mode that at least
外界看起来更被动的模式
from the outside seems more passive
或更多的是关注在支持他人上
or more about supporting others.
这两种人不分好坏
Neither of these are good or bad.
那是因为多巴胺只是一个分子
And that's because dopamine is a molecule.
它不管你怎么去达到目标
It doesn't care how you reach your goals.
它只在乎你要达到这个目标
It only cares that you reach your goals
因为内在的感觉又是一种温和的快乐
because the internal sensation is one again of mild pleasure
又有点痛苦  但如果你达不到这些目标
a little bit of pain, although more pain over time.
随着时间的流逝会越来越痛苦
If you're not reaching those goals
它会让你不去关注此刻和当下
and it takes you away from the here and now.
所以说到这里
So at about this point in the podcast
我猜你已经在想  好极了
I'm guessing that some you are thinking, okay, great.
那我想要更多的多巴胺
I want more dopamine.
我想更有动力
I want to be more motivated.
我不想拖延
I don't wanna procrastinate as much
同时我还希望能够体验生活
and I want to be able to experience life.
我也希望这些分子在某些特定时刻能被释放
I want these here and now molecules to be released as well.
好吧  有一种方法可以做到  但是你必须了解
Well, there is a way to do that, but you have to
这跟拖延症的原因不是一回事
understand the source of procrastination is not one thing.
基本上有两种拖延症
There are basically two kinds
研究说拖延症患者分为两种
of procrastinators or so says the research.
第一类人实际上是
The first kind are people that actually really
他很享受即将到来的DDL带来的压力
enjoy the stress of the impending deadline.
这是他们采取行动的唯一途径
It's the only way they can get into action.
这些人真的很喜欢
These are people that really like the feeling of
一个小时就要到DDL了
something being due in an hour and how activated
然后激活敏锐而专注的感觉
and sharp and focused that makes them feel.
那些人是使用了肾上腺素系统
Those people are people that are tapping
和压力系统以获得好结果
into the epinephrin system, the stress system
压力开始变大
and for which the stress really tightens
为他们创造了
their ability to see it creates that
苏打水吸管般的“通道视野”
soda straw view of the world.
它会在身体上引出一个想要动的因素
It creates an action element
让他们觉得自己想赶快动起来
in the body that makes them feel like they wanna move.
它确实消除了他们的所有干扰
It really eliminates all the distractions for them.
所以他们实际上是在利用压力  内在压力
So they're actually leveraging stress internal stress
为了达到他们在其他情况下无法做到的状态
in order to achieve a state that they can't seem to otherwise achieve.
我不会告诉你
I won't tell you what to do
如何去克服各种拖延症
in order to overcome all kinds of procrastination
但从逻辑的角度来看  这是有道理的
but from a logical perspective, it makes sense
因此  如果让你们去考虑
therefore, for those kinds of people to think
如何用其他的方法
about other ways that they can get their system
让你们的系统进入激活状态
into activation, I've talked
在以前的播客中对此进行了讨论
about this in previous podcasts
其中一些工具方法可能是
but a couple of those tools might be the
我们所谓的超氧呼吸
what we called super oxygenation breathing
我承认  这个方法也并不是每次都适用
which I admit is not always super oxygenating.
所以这就是  如果不想让它消耗任何东西
So this would be if didn't want it to consume anything.
可能是25-30个周期的
This could be 25 or 30 cycles of
深吸气和呼气
in deep inhales and exhales.
它可能会产生一些焦虑和低水平的压力
It's likely to create some anxiety and a low level stress.
如果你是容易发生恐慌发作的人
If you're someone who's prone to panic attacks
我不推荐这样做  但这方法很简单
I wouldn't recommend this, but it's pretty straight forward.
它将肾上腺素部署到你的系统中
It will deploy adrenaline into your system.
你会发现你的视野开始集中
And you will find that your visual field is focused
这样你就可以工作了
and you will be able to work
集中完注意力之后  你就等一会儿
and focus better than if you just kinda waited around
等待激发你的冲动
for some wave of motivation to wash over you.
通常你等到
Normally you're waiting
那个DDL到来之前
for that deadline to come into sight
然后这就是刺激
and then that's what the stimulus is.
但你可以自行引导肾上腺素释放
But you can self-direct adrenaline release
不摄取任何东西
without ingesting anything.
你可以摄取咖啡  咖啡因
You can also ingest coffee, caffeine
或拿铁  或类似的东西
or Mate or something like that, which is what
这也就是为什么我经常喜欢含咖啡因的咖啡的原因
I prefer very often to coffee, which has caffeine.
咖啡因确实会让你释放低水平的多巴胺
Caffeine does release dopamine at low levels
目前尚不清楚它会释放多少多巴胺
how much it releases dopamine it isn't clear.
但似乎确实增加了这些神经元在伏隔核的放电
It seems to increase firing in these neurons
大约增加30％
in the nucleus accumbens by about 30%
这是一个很低的水平
which is a pretty low level,
但它会给咖啡因敏感的人引起躁动
but it can create agitation so for
这可能是个问题
caffeine sensitive people, that could be a problem.
我以前谈论过事情
I've talked before about things
像L-酪氨酸是多巴胺  或刺毛黧豆的前体
like L tyrosine the precursor to dopamine or Mucuna Purina.
我在上一集中谈到了
I talked about that in the last episode
但是如果你没有看  我稍微提一下
but if you didn't see that, just to remind you
L-酪氨酸存在于红肉中
L tyrosine is present in red meats,
在某些坚果和L-酪氨酸
it's in certain nuts and L tyrosine
是多巴胺的前体
is the precursor to dopamine.
你可以补充L-酪氨酸
You can supplement L tyrosine.
如果愿意的话  你会在多巴胺方面受到很大的影响
If you like, you will get a big inflection in dopamine
但与此相关的是突然下降 崩溃
but there is a crash associated with it.
但是  这将在短期内增加动力
However, it will increase motivation in the short term
不是在建议任何人这样做
not suggesting anyone do this.
我想说清楚 我经常说的话
I wanna be very clear to say what I always say.
我不是医生
I'm not a doctor.
我不开处方
I don't prescribe anything.
我是教授
I'm a professor.
我讲道理
I profess things.
你必须知道这些东西是否合适你
You have to know whether or not these things are appropriate
是否可以改善你的身心健康
for your mental and physical health or not.
因此  你需要咨询医生
So you need to consult a doctor.
例如  患有精神分裂症的人
For instance, people who suffer from schizotypal
或精神分裂症或躁狂症
or schizophrenia or mania should probably not
可能不应该服用增加其多巴胺水平的补品
be taking supplements that increase their dopamine levels.
如果你无法提高集中水平
Now, if you can't increase your level
和你的警觉水平
of focus and your level of alertness
以及良好呼吸的动机水平
and your level of motivation using breathing well
那么可能还会有其他事情在起作用
then there might be something else at play.
还有其他拖延者
There are other procrastinators
为此  他们根本没有释放出足够的多巴胺
for which they simply are not releasing enough dopamine.
他们没有制造足够的多巴胺
They're not making enough dopamine.
对于这部分人
And for those people
有很多可以增加多巴胺的东西
there are a variety of things that can increase dopamine.
我建议你与精神科医生交谈
I do suggest you talk to a psychiatrist
或我谈论过刺毛黧豆
or doctor I've talked about Mucuna Purina,
里面99.9％ 都是左旋多巴  也就是多巴胺的前体
which is 99.9%. L-DOPA the precursor to dopamine.
所以有些人在
So there are people that do much better when
他们服用会增加多巴胺水平的东西
they take things that increase their dopamine levels.
有抗抑郁药  如安非他酮  bupropion
There are antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior own
后者是它的别称
which increase is the other name for it
增加了多巴胺和肾上腺素
which increased dopamine and epinephrin,
它会增加癫痫发作的风险
it can increase risk of epileptic attacks
如果你是癫痫病患者
if you're epileptic.
再说一遍  你必须和你的医生谈
So again, you have to talk to your doctor
但它们会增加多巴胺  动机和注意力
but they will increase dopamine and motivation and focus.
但是  如果你回想一下
However, if you think back
我们之前关于多巴胺的讨论
to our earlier discussion about dopamine, dopamine
如果多巴胺很高  会带来愉悦感
if it's very high, creates a sense of pleasure
以及对更多东西的渴望
and the desire for more,
这样你也可以成为那种
so you can also become a person
永远得不到满足的人
for which enough is never enough.
多巴胺真正想要的  唯一一件事就是
The only thing that dopamine really wants is more
更多释放多巴胺的东西
of the thing that releases dopamine
多巴胺的变化如此之大
and so big inflections in dopamine,
他们是否来自可卡因
whether or not they come from cocaine
或者它们是否来自补品
or whether or not they come from a supplementation,
咖啡因运动研究方案
caffeine exercise study regime
只会让你想要更多的东西
will just make you want more of something
我们都听说过成长心态
and we've all heard before of growth mindset
我同事有一个惊人的发现
this incredible discovery of my colleague,
卡罗尔·德威克（Carol Dweck）发现 一些积极的心态
Carol Dweck where some of these positive mindsets
心理学界提出的
that the psychology community has put forth
对于追求目标
as really good for pursuit of goals
和追求需要长时间努力的事情真的很好
and pursuit of things that require long bouts of effort.
好吧  如果你可以学着把多巴胺加到心理上的这个过程
Well, it's wonderful if you can learn to attach dopamine
那就太好了但是
to that process psychologically, but
如果你开始增加量
if you're starting to augment the amount
增加多巴胺量
of dopamine increase the amount
通过补剂和处方药之类的
of dopamine through things like supplementation
那么会发生的是
and prescription drugs what's gonna happen is
你不仅需要追求更多
you're not only gonna need to pursue more
还有更多
and more of the sorts of things
与多巴胺有关的东西
that are associated with the dopamine.
因此  更多的学习  更多的运动
So more doing more studying, more sport
更多的追求  更高的山  更多的钱
more pursuit, higher mountains, more money,
还有更多  但我们知道随着时间的流逝
more whatever but we know that over time,
这种追求的反面
the mirror image of that
缺乏成就感的痛苦也会加剧
the pain of lack of accomplishment will also increase.
这就是愉悦痛苦的关系
This is the pleasure pain relationship
我们之前讨论过的
that we talked about earlier.
等一下  我要谈谈
So in a few moments, I'm gonna talk
关于如何考虑和调配健康的多巴胺时间表
about how to think about healthy dopamine schedules
但我想先退一步
but I just wanna take a step back for a second
谈谈Dolby的反面
and talk a little bit about the flip side of Dolby
以及所谓的多巴胺崩溃之后会发生什么
and what happens after this so-called dopamine crash
我们体内有着什么机制
what mechanisms are installed in us,
因为真的
because believe it or not,
我们人体内已有的机制
there are mechanisms that are installed in all of us that really put the complete
会将多巴胺完全中断  为什么会发生这种事情
and total break on dopamine, why they're there
以及它们的作用是什么  因为你之前已经经历过这些
and what they do because you've experienced these before
实际上  你可以通过多种方式进行导航
and there are actually ways that you can navigate them.
这些多巴胺的崩溃是
These dopamine crashes are these intentional
专门有的多巴胺抑制机制
dopamine suppression mechanisms
为了能启动更健康的多巴胺时间表
in order to leverage healthier dopamine schedules
并让你更有动力
and to feel more motivated.
也许在所有人类中最基本的机制之一
Perhaps one of the most fundamental mechanisms
就是神经回路中
in all humans is the neuro circuitry designed
为了寻找伴侣并繁殖的设计
for seeking out mates and for reproduction
那是因为任何一种物种都要延续
and that's because the continuation
是任何一种物种的主要驱动力
of any one species is the primary driver for any species.
这就是现实
That's just the reality.
我在这里去掉所有上下文  所有语境
Now I'm removing all context here.
所以  无论我怎么说
So whatever I say, of course, it's
在双方适合的年龄背景下
on a backdrop of consensual age
适当的物种  适当的环境
appropriate species, appropriate context,
所有条件都合适
appropriate all of that.
这与生殖和性的社会学无关
This is not about the sociology of reproduction and sex.
这是从生物学出发
This is about the biology,
男女性别的生物学
the biology of sex in males and females
XX染色体  XY
doesn't matter if it's XX chromosome X
XX  YX  YY  不管这些
Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter.
现实情况是在预期到性和生殖的时候
The reality is that dopamine is released
多巴胺被释放
on anticipation and consummation of sex and reproduction.
高潮后  无论染色体是什么
And after orgasm, regardless of chromosomal background
多巴胺急剧减少
there's a dramatic decrease in dopamine
并增加一种叫做催乳激素的激素
and an increase in a hormone called prolactin.
那么  催乳素与
Now, prolactin is associated
在哺乳期的母亲的乳汁有关
with milk let-down in lactating mothers.
它也存在于男性和普通人群中
It's also present in males and in general
催乳素会使人产生昏昏欲睡的感觉
prolactin creates a sense of lethargy of stillness
并且缺乏移动的欲望
and lack of desire to move
缺乏追求更多的欲望
and lack of desire to pursue more
无论释放多少多巴胺
of whatever released the dopamine.
催乳素实际上设定了
Prolactin in fact, sets the refractory period
雄性再次交配的能力的不应期
on a male's ability to mate again
这边的个人差异将有很大的不同
now this is gonna vary tremendously from individual to individual.
有数据显示
It also can, there are data showing
从不同的配对中
that it can vary tremendously
它也可以有很大的不同
from mate pairing to mate pairing the number
让多巴胺释放的第一件事是新颖
one thing that releases dopamine is novelty
确实缩短了不应期
and it is true that the refractory period is shortened
通过引进新配偶
by the introduction of novel mates.
第一次试验
This was first shown in a kind
通过鸡来进行测量的经典实验
of classic experiment in of all things in chickens.
这称为柯立芝效应
This is called the Coolidge effect
故事是这样
and the story is the story goes
我相信这是一个真实的故事
and I believe it's a true story,
实际上它被放在所有神经内分泌学教科书中
it's actually in all the neuroendocrinology textbooks.
所以我相信这是真的
So I believe it's true is
总统卡尔文·柯立芝（Calvin Coolidge）
that president Calvin Coolidge
在参观养鸡场
was visiting a chicken farm.
他们被带着参观
They were is being taken around and the person who was
领队主持着  向他们展示了一只公鸡
hosting the visit showed them
柯立芝和他的妻子
a rooster that was Coolidge and his wife
在访问中  说
were on the visit and said
“这只公鸡每天交配成千上万次”
"this rooster copulates thousands of times per day."
然后柯立芝太太
And Mrs. Coolidge apparently
很明显推了推柯立芝总统
kind of elbowed president Coolidge
并说：“啊  你听到了吗”
and said, "ah, you hear that" kind of like pointing
看到这只公鸡的威力  柯立芝说  “是的
out the prowess of this rooster and Coolidge said," yeah
但是我问你一个问题
but let me ask you a question,
是同一只母鸡还是不同的母鸡”
same hen or different hens."
结果原来是不同的母鸡
It turns out it was different hens.
其中的原因是
And the reason is the introduction
引入一个新的伴侣会增加多巴胺水平
of a novel mate increases dopamine levels.
有趣的是
And what's interesting about this is that
交配猴催乳素达到高点
after copulation prolactin goes through the roof
并防止进一步的交配后多巴胺的崩溃
and prevents further copulation dopamine crashes
但是引入某种新颖性可以缩短这一过程
but the introduction of some sort of novelty shortens this.
我不是在告诉人们
Now this is not a ploy for people
需要经常改变伴侣
to change mates often what this
而是想说  这是关于多巴胺和催乳激素系统的故事
is a story about the dopamine and prolactin system
在人类中也存在
that also exists in humans.
实际上某些群体的人们
Now, there are actually things that people in certain communities take
为了绕开这些不应期
in order to bypass these refractory periods.
有了增加多巴胺的药物
There's actually drugs that increase dopamine
去抑制催乳激素  反过来也有
suppress prolactin and vice versa.
实际上  还有另一种抑制催乳素的方法
There's actually another way to suppress prolactin.
维生素B6是一种相当有效的催乳素抑制剂  跟锌一样
Vitamin B6 is a fairly potent prolactin inhibitor as a zinc.
如果你去查一下资料
And if you look out there
在文献中  对于那些
in the literature and for those either
在健康和体育表演的社区中
in the wellness and cost sports performance community
很多所谓的“睾丸激素促进剂”
a lot of the so-called quote unquote testosterone
实际上是维生素B6和锌的组合
boosters are actually combinations of vitamin B6
可抑制催乳激素
and zinc which inhibit prolactin
并通过抑制催乳激素增加多巴胺
and by way of inhibiting prolactin increase dopamine.
因此  它们在这方面确实具有一定的功能作用
So they do have some functional effect in that regard.
他们并没有直接增加睾丸激素
They're not really increasing testosterone directly
他们是会去抑制催乳素水平
they're suppressing prolactin levels.
还有一些临床情况  例如高泌乳素血症
And there are clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia
导致性欲大量下降等等
which leads to massive decreases in libido, et cetera.
还有处方药
And there are prescription drugs to
治疗高泌乳素血症
treat hyperprolactinemia, which of course
当然  你应该经常和内分泌学家谈谈
you should always talk to an endocrinologist
那些处方药到底能不能吃
about those sorts of prescription drugs.
所以有趣的是  这种多巴胺和催乳激素的非常基本的机制
So it's interesting that this very basic mechanism
这种产生动力  抑制动力的系统
of dopamine and prolactin, this sort of motivation, no more motivation is a system that evolved
进化出来首先是为了繁殖的  但确实是这样的
for reproduction first, but that actually takes place.
例如  你可以在世界其他地方看到
And you can see in elsewhere in the world, for instance
有很多不同类型的精神分裂症
schizophrenia disease that has many different types
但是精神分裂症是经常发生的情况
and facets, but schizophrenia is a case of an often
多巴胺系统的过度活化
of hyperactivation of the dopamine system
活化程度非常高  以至于让人觉得有点嗨
so much so that it can make people feel kind of high,
他们产生幻觉  我的意思是
they hallucinate, I mean, we're talking very
大脑中的多巴胺回路非常高或已经失调
very high or dysregulated dopamine circuits in the brain.
精神分裂症的治疗方法之一
One of the treatments for schizophrenia
是服用阻断多巴胺受体的药物
are drugs that block dopamine receptors.
非常不幸
And if you have the it's unfortunate,
有很多在外面的人
there are so many people that are out
在街上  患有精神分裂症的人
on the street these days who have schizophrenia,
有些人正在服药
some of whom are taking their meds,
有些人没有
some of who, whom aren't
如果你在街上看到有人在做什么
if you ever see somebody on the street that's doing what's
就像嘴唇抽搐  身体扭曲
it's like a lip smacking and writhing
这实际上被称为迟发性运动障碍
it's actually called tardive dyskinesia.
这是通过服用这些抗多巴胺能药物
This is a movement disorder that's created
造成的运动障碍
by taking these anti dopaminergic drugs.
所以你可以想像  这些抗兴奋剂
So you can imagine these anti-doping synergic drugs
在抑制幻觉方面非常有效
while being very effective in suppressing hallucinations
他们创造了这些运动问题
they create these movement problems
因为多巴胺对于运动通路的重要性
because of dopamines importance
所谓的金字塔形通路
for the movement circuitry so-called pyramidal circuitry for the aficionados.
此外  你有时会看到
In addition, you sometimes see
在服用某些药物的男性中
in males that take these drugs, drugs
像氟哌啶醇和其他多巴胺阻滞剂
like haloperidol and the other dopamine blockers
他们实际上会长出乳房组织的女性乳房发育
that they actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia.
所以男性乳房组织的发育是
So the development of male breast tissue is
因为催乳素水平升高
because of the elevated levels of prolactin
抑制了多巴胺
because they're suppressing their dopamine so much.
这是一个非常极端的情况  但也许
Now that's a really extreme case, but maybe perhaps
如果你看到有人在做这些非常奇怪的事情
if you see somebody engaging these very strange kind
脸部扭曲和身体扭曲行为
of face riding and body riding behaviors
这实际上不是他们精神疾病的结果
that's actually not a consequence of their mental illness.
这是大多数药物的作用
That's a consequence most often of the drugs
他们用来治疗精神疾病的药物
that they're taking to treat the mental illness.
这些是那些药物的副作用
Those are side effects of those drugs.
催乳素随时都在增加
Now prolactin is increased any time.
我们经历过一些真正加强的  丰富的事情
We have some really heightened, intense experience.
它不仅在性和生殖后释放
It's not just released after sex and reproduction.
催乳素是在一些重要事件发生后释放的
Prolactin is released after some major event,
这实际上是与一些
it's actually responsible
一些产后抑郁症有关系
thought for some of postpartum depression
对于不同类型的那种  失望程度低
for different types of kind of the, the let down the low.
我可以清楚地记得在学期结束之后
I can distinctly remember that after finals or
或者发表了大论文之后  我会非常非常高兴
after publishing a big paper, I would be very, very happy
但后来我发现  哦  你知道
but then I'd find that, Oh, you know
接下来发生的事情  可能会变得有点暗淡
like what next or things might seem a little bit dimmed
第二天左右或下周  变得没什么意思
or dulled out for the next day or so, or the following week.
多巴胺释放的时间表很不一样
The timescales on these are gonna vary
因为有些人会释放很多多巴胺
because some people release a lot of dopamine
在很长一段时间内对好事情做出回应
for a very long time in response to something great
其他人则有一个多巴胺快速反应
and other people have a quick inflection
然后他们又回到不太舒服的状态
of dopamine and then they're back to feeling not so great.
确实因人而异
It really varies from person to person.
实际上  很久以前
In fact, long ago, I started
当我开始了解多巴胺奖励通路时
as I learned about dopamine reward circuitry
以及多巴胺和催乳激素之间的关系
and the relationship would be between dopamine and prolactin.
我就开始利用这一点  真的
I started to leverage this, believe it or not.
一些重大事件之后
After some major event
我要服用几百毫克的维生素B6
I would take a couple 100 milligrams of vitamin B6.
但我认为对于患有糖尿病性神经病的人
I think for people who have diabetic neuropathy
你要小心一点
you need to be careful
如果要补充维生素B6  请咨询医生
with vitamin B6 check with your doctor.
有人告诉我  虽然我没有找到文献
I was told, although I haven't found the literature
在某些情况下会发生一些不良反应
on this that it can, in some cases
就是加剧周围神经病变
exacerbate peripheral neuropathy, but
但对于大多数人来说  它被认为是相当安全的
for most people it's thought to be reasonably safe
但同样  请务必与你的医生沟通
but again, always check with your physician
但是我自己会用一些B6  来抵消这一多巴胺低点
but I would take some B6 to kind of offset some of that low.
而且真的  我不知道是主观因素还是什么
And I actually, I don't know if it was subjective or not
但它似乎起到了积极的作用
but it seemed to have somewhat of a positive effect.
我也开始逐渐相信
I also started just internalizing the fact
多巴胺是如此主观的一个东西
that dopamine is so subjective.
多巴胺有一些客观方面
There are objective aspects to dopamine
释放了多少
and how much is released
但是对多巴胺也有一些主观影响
but there's also some subjective effects to dopamine.
因此  你可以做的一件事
And so one of the things that you can do
让你自己成为一个更快乐的人
in order to generally just be a happier person
特别是如果你是一个追求长期目标的人
especially if you're a person in pursuit of long-term goals
你想要延长
of any kind is the longer that you can extend
多巴胺释放的正面作用
that positive phase of the dopamine release.
而且  你同时想要减轻对痛苦的反应
And the more that you can blunt the pain response to that
那么你实际上可以在认知上做到这一点
the better, and you can actually do this cognitively.
我曾经和我的实验室开玩笑说  当我们发表论文时
I used to joke with my lab that when we'd publish a paper
我会很兴奋
I would get really excited, but I wouldn't
但我不会太过于兴奋  而我会做的是
allow myself to get too excited what I wanted to do instead
而我仍然试图做的是
and what I've still tried to do is try
尝试并扩大积极经历的弧线
and extend the arc of that positive experience
很简单
as long as I possibly can simply
比如回想这件事情  哦  那真是太酷了
by thinking back like, Oh, that was really cool.
我真的很喜欢那项研究
I really enjoy doing that work.
我真的很喜欢这个发现
I really enjoyed the discovery.
我真的很喜欢与
I really enjoy doing that with the people
当时我一起工作的同事
that I was working with at the time,
那是多么的荣幸
what a pleasure that was.
我可以很容易地从人物照片中得到
I can get this very easily
例如Costello
from pictures of people, in things like Costello
我真的很喜欢旅行
that I really enjoy trips that I've taken.
这样你就可以增加愉悦感
So you can extend pleasure
不必一遍又一遍地实际去做这种行为
without having to engage in the behavior over and over.
那也扩展了多巴胺释放的弧度
That's extending the arc of that dopamine release as well.
它抵消了一些痛苦
It offset some of the pain
那种经历没有发生的痛苦
of not having that experience occur over
一遍又一遍
and over and over again.
对于那些表现出色的人
Now for the high performers out there
你可能很熟悉
you're probably familiar
有很大成就的人
with this many people who have a big achievement.
他们的第一个想法是
Their first thoughts are will now, what
那么我接下来要做什么？
what am I gonna do next?
我怎么样去超过那个？
How am I ever gonna exceed that?
确实有很多对这种多巴胺的感觉
And indeed many people who are very high
追求新奇的事物的感觉
on this kind of dopamine sensation
非常兴奋 非常嗨的人  容易上瘾
and novelty seeking scale are prone to addiction.
他们容易会狂热地追捧
They're prone to the rabid pursuit
外部目标
of external goals of external perception to the neglect
然后忽略这些使他们能够
of these internal mechanisms that allow them to
感到镇定和快乐的内部机制
feel calm and happy.
所以对于那些  很有动力的人
So for people that are very driven, very motivated
采取能够关注在当下的措施
adopting a practice of being able to engage
就是"这里+现在"
in the here and now the sort
我们之前讨论过的一些练习
of almond type practices we talked about earlier
学习如何实现真正的一夜安眠
of learning how to achieve a really good night's sleep
定期通过我所说的工具和机制
on a regular basis through tools and mechanisms I talked
以前的播客中的内容
about in previous podcasts gives us sort
给了我们一种寻求乐趣
of balance to the pleasure seeking for an offsetting
抵消痛苦  以及当下的快乐中的平衡
of pain and the pleasure in the here and now.
因此  快乐实际上是两件事
So pleasure is really two things.
追求的快乐
It's a joy in pursuit
但也是你现在拥有的乐趣
but it's also the joy in what you have.
这里有一个很好的模型
And there's a beautiful model
展示了发展的情感发展
of emotional development that was developed
加州大学洛杉矶分校艾伦·肖尔教授
by Alan shore professor at UCLA
也是精神科医生  他谈论一些基本知识
and psychiatrist that talks about some of the basics
良好的父母亲依恋关系
of good infant parent attachment
良好的养育子女方式

会促进健康的成人关系
to healthy adult relationships
有助于情绪调节  往往包括双方的
and emotion regulation tends to include both sides
多巴胺血清素光谱图
of this dopamine serotonin spectrum.
我们谈论孩子与父母之间的关系
We talk about the relationship between child
通常是母亲  父亲也有
and parent typically was the mother, but also father
让孩子真正兴奋的方法
where you can get the child really excited
通过尖叫和逗他们
by kind of squealing and ramping them
或谈论某事  冰淇淋  游戏
up or talking about something or ice cream or play.
这个孩子变得非常兴奋
And the kid gets very excited.
那就是多巴胺能系统
That's the dopaminergic system
对即将到来的事情的期待  但是
the anticipation of something that's coming, but as well
以一种真正的方式与孩子们互动
engaging with children in a way that's really
关于你所拥有的一切
about everything that you have right
在此刻  这本书的阅读
in the here and now, the reading of the book
孩子们似乎总是再问一次
the kids always seem to ask one more time.
再问一个
One more.
他们似乎想要更多他们喜欢的东西
They seem to want more of the things that they enjoy
但真正与他们互动
but really engaging with them
以增加他们的愉悦感的方式
in a way that increases their sense of pleasure
为那里的东西  同时给他们很多
for what's right there, as well as giving them a lot
令他们兴奋的事情和积极的期望
of things to be excited about and positive anticipation.
几年前曾与失足孩子一起相处
Now, having worked years ago with at-risk kids and also
还有年幼的孩子  一起夏令营之类的
with young kids at summer camps and things like that
你学到的一件事就是你永远不要说“可能”
one of the things that you learn is you never say maybe
可能给孩子一个奖励
to a kid about a reward.
如果你说  “我们等下可能会吃冰淇淋”
If you say, we might have ice cream later
你实质上是在说“我们等下要去吃冰淇淋”
you are essentially saying we are having ice cream.
他们没有听到“可能”
They don't hear the maybe part
事实证明  大人也听不到
and it turns out adults don't either.
真的很有趣
It's really interesting.
有一种叫做“奖励预测错误”的东西
There's something called reward prediction error.
我之前已经说过了
I've talked about this before
但我还没有真正在多巴胺系统的语境下  深入地讨论过
but I haven't really talked about it deeply in the context
正如我所说的
of the dopamine system, dopamine, as I've said,
多巴胺系统参与到对匮乏的期待中
is involved in anticipation of wanting,
不涉及它
not of having it's involved
激励你想要的东西
in motivation toward the thing that you want.
它使我们倾向于采取行动
And it biases us towards action.
奖励预测误差 =作为响应释放的多巴胺的实际数量 - 预期时释放的多巴胺数量
Reward prediction, error equals the actual amount of dopamine that's released in response to something versus minus the amount that's expected.
好  因此  如果你告诉孩子  “我们可能会吃冰淇淋”
Okay. So if you tell a kid, we might have ice cream
他们听的是  “我们要吃冰淇淋了”  他们期望得到
they hear we're gonna have ice cream and they expect it.
如果你以后再说  好吧
And if you later say, well
我们不吃冰淇淋了
we're not gonna have ice cream
因为我之前说的是“可能”
and I said, maybe that's actually gonna lead
这会导致多巴胺的崩溃更大
to a much bigger crash in dopamine.
这将导致一个负面信号
It's going to lead to a negative signal,
惩罚信号
a punishment signal.
从字面上看  这感觉就像是痛苦
It's literally going to feel like pain.
所以孩子们  你可以利用这一点
So kids, you can leverage this.
如果你父母说“也许”
If your parents say
他们其实是告诉你多巴胺系统“绝对会”
maybe they're effectively telling your dopamine system
那么 成年人也是如此
absolutely. Now adults are like this too.
如果我们认为可能会发生但没有发生
If we think something might happen and it doesn't happen
我们会产生很大的崩溃
there's a big crash in our aspect,
在我们的情感上有崩溃  那是因为
in our emotionality and that's because
多巴胺系统的释放
that dopamine system goes from firing
从大约每秒3到4次
about three to four times per second
增至每秒约10或15次
to about 10 or 15 times per second
只要出现  有可能发生的事情
in the possibility that something might happen
可能性深深地融入了我们的生物学
possibility is deeply woven into our biology
多巴胺和动机系统
of the dopamine and motivation system,
作为我们大概在古代的一种方式
as a way for us presumably in ancient times
探索新领域
to explore novel territories
感受到“那里可能有水”
and get a sense that maybe there's water there.
“也许那里有配偶”
Maybe there are mates there.
“也许那里有更好的食物”
Maybe there's better food there
“也许那里有资源”
maybe there's resources there.
“也许”很重要
The maybe is important thing
从语言上讲  也许就是也许
that in language terms maybe means maybe, but
但用神经生物学的术语 “也许”意味着
in neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps
会有惊喜
there's going to be the surprise
会产生更高的多巴胺奖励
of an even bigger dopamine reward.
多巴胺最爱一件事
And the one thing dopamine loves more
就是惊喜
than anything else is surprise.
当我们得到积极的结果时  我们进入信箱
When we get something positive, we go to the mailbox
我们以为是一些账单  你打开
we're expecting some bills and you open it
结果是一封信
up and you get a letter
是一个从很久没有见到的朋友寄来的
from somebody you haven't thought about in a long time.
而你也喜欢那个人
And you adore that person.
那将是一次巨大的多巴胺释放
That's a huge dopamine release.
它实际上会触发神经可塑性
It actually triggers neuroplasticity.
你可能没有忘记
You probably never forget that
因为多巴胺启动可塑性
because of the way that dopamine Gates' plasticity.
当我们得到一个惊喜
When we get an, a surprise
而我们不想要的东西
of something that we didn't want,
也会创造可塑性
also it creates plasticity.
因此  惊喜  新颖  动力和奖励
So the surprise, novelty, motivation, and reward
它们都被编织到我们称为“多巴胺”的大包裹中
they're all woven into this package that we call dopamine.
而且很酷的事情是  你实际上可以
And the cool thing is you can actually
可以用一种方式调节这整个系统
regulate this whole system in a way that will steer you
让你倾向于更积极地期待生活中的事情
or lean you towards more positive anticipation
并且减少失望
of things in life and less disappointment.
而这就是我们所说的
It's simply a matter
去调整我们所谓的多巴胺时间表
of adjusting what we call the dopamine schedule.
好的  在我们继续之前  有几件事
Okay. A couple things before we continue,
我们将在几分钟内提一下 注意力不足这个问题
we're gonna talk about attention deficit in a few minutes.
但在此之前  我想谈一谈
But before that, I wanna talk
我在以前的播客中提到的事情
about something that I've mentioned before
但你可能不知道
in previous podcasts, but that you may not be aware of
即便你知道  你可能还在做这件事情
and if you're aware of you may still be doing,
而这件事情会严重损害你释放多巴胺的能力
which is severely injuring your ability to release dopamine
在某种程度上也会产生很大的失望感
it's creating a sense of disappointment in ways
很有可能在心理和身体上伤害你
that are most likely hurting you mentally and physically.
那就是 在半夜看光导致的
And that's the blunting of dopamine
多巴胺的钝化
by viewing light in the middle of the night
我知道这不是关于睡眠和昼夜节律的讨论
I realized this is not a discussion about sleep
但现在的实验数据是如此之多
and circadian rhythms, but the data now are so
全都显示
strong showing that viewing bright light
从大约10:00 PM到4:00 AM之间经常接触亮光
from about 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM too often triggers activation
会触发激活一个通路  称为松果体缰
of this circuit called the habenula
所以这通路是从眼睛
So this is eye to
你的视网膜
It goes from your retina
到一个叫做松果体缰HABENULA的结构
to a structure called the habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A
然后从松果体缰再连接到一些奖励通路
Then from the habenula to some of this reward circuitry
并且抑制了奖励通路的激活
and it suppresses the activation of the reward.
不仅在那一刻  而且会延伸到
Circuitry, not just in that moment, but to things
你日常积极的预期和追求的目标
that you normally positively anticipate and pursue.
我现在提这个的原因
And the reason I'm bring this
是因为我还没有真正
up now is because I haven't really gone
非常深入地讲解多巴胺系统
into depth on the dopamine system before now, you understand
你现在知道我们有这个非常宝贵的奖励系统
that you have this very precious reward system.
那是一把双刃剑
That's kind of a double-edged sword.
它需要得到照顾和良好的对待
It needs to be taken care of and treated well.
你可以使用它  但不要过度使用它  等等
You wanna use it, but not overuse it, et cetera
但如果半夜暴露在明亮的光线中
but getting bright light exposure in the middle
会降低你释放多巴胺的能力
of the night is reducing your capacity to release dopamine.
所以不只是说
So it's not just
那段时间中你没有得到的睡眠
about the sleep that you're not getting in that time.
还是因为你没有得到多巴胺
It's also that you're not getting the dopamine
本来你完全可以拥有那部分多巴胺的
that would otherwise be available to you.
所以你实际上正在
So you're actually taking, think of light
你可以把半夜里的亮光
in the middle of the night as a kind
想成一种多巴胺的阻滞剂
of antagonist is kind of a blocker of dopamine.
也许会对你有所帮助
Maybe that'll help you.
如果你是一个必须在半夜工作的人
If you're somebody who has to work in the middle of the night
而你想绕开这种多巴胺抑制
and you wanna bypass this dopamine suppression
请参阅有关时差和轮班工作的那期播客
please see the episode about jet lag and shift work
因为在那期中有很多方法
because there are a lot
将使你能够做到这一点
of tips there that will allow you to do that
为了了解如何控制多巴胺系统
in order to understand how to control the dopamine system
利用它来改善生活
how to leverage it for a better life.
你需要了解
You need to understand the results
一个非常重要的实验的结果
of a very important experiment.
这个实验能够将愉悦与动机分开
This experiment was able to separate pleasure from motivation.
很简单  但就像许多简单的实验一样
It's a very simple, but like many simple experiments
一个非常优雅的实验  他们做的
a very elegant experiment, what they did
在动物和人类身上都进行了实验
and this has now been done in animals.
他们给老鼠提供食物
and in humans, they offered rats food.
这是老鼠特别喜欢的食物
It was a food that they particularly liked
然后老鼠会不断去推一个按钮/杆子  来得到食物
and the animals would lever press for a pellet of food
这种经典实验
kind of classic experiment that eat the food
前提是小动物喜欢这种食物
and they presumably liked the food
因为它们有动力  所以按下杆并吃掉事物
because they were motivated, press the lever and eat it.
很好  他们取了其他一些老鼠
Great. They took other rats.
消除了它们的多巴胺神经元
They eliminated the dopamine neurons.
可以通过注射来做到这一点
You can do this by injection
注射一些破坏这些神经元的神经毒素
of a neurotoxin that destroys these neurons.
因此  它们的大脑实际上就没有多巴胺了
So they actually had no dopamine in their brain.
它们没有释放多巴胺的能力
They have no ability to release dopamine
他们给了老鼠杠杆  老鼠坐在那里
and they gave them a lever that rats would sit there
它们就按了杆  就吃了食物
and they'd hit the lever and they'd eat the food.
他们仍然很喜欢食物的
They're still enjoyed the food.
所以你可能会想  好吧
So you say, well, okay
那就是多巴胺与动机有关呗
so dopamine is involved in motivation.
小老鼠都挺快乐
It is involved in pleasure.
不
No, it absolutely is.
他们仍然可以享受食物  但是如果他们移动了老鼠
They could still enjoy the food, but if they moved the rat
它与操纵杆的距离为一个身子的长度
literally one body length away from the lever.
他们会发现有多巴胺的动物会移动身体
What they found was the animals that had dopamine would move
移到操纵杆上  按下并进食
over to the lever, press it and eat.
还有那些没有多巴胺的老鼠
And the ones, the rats that did not have dopamine available
对它们来说  甚至不想移动一个身体的距离  一只小老鼠那么点的距离
to them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length
去按下控制杆以获取食物
to the lever in order to press it and get the food.
因此多巴胺
Dopamine, therefore is not
它不是体验愉悦的能力
about the ability to experience pleasure,
它是愉悦的动机
it is about motivation for pleasure.
这已经在人类的不同情景中
This has been repeated in humans
重复了很多很多
in a variety of different scenarios.
虽然不是进行杠杆按下操作这么简单的事情
You can't really do the lever press thing quite as easily
但是我们知道  多巴胺水平很低的人
but we know that people have low levels
动力不足
of dopamine are simply less motivated
即使他们可以实现愉悦  开心
even though they can achieve pleasure.
这会产生严重的后果
And this has serious ramifications
如今
for the fact that now, quote
“愉悦感”或引诱我们的事物
unquote pleasure or ways to induce things that we
给我们带来的快乐无处不在
believe give us pleasure are everywhere.
它们触手可及
And they're within reach.
的确  我们不必为我们的食物觅食
We don't have to forage for our food.
但有很多高度加工的  高糖高脂食品
There's lot of highly processed, high sugar high fat foods.
还有一些健康的食物  味道很好
There's also foods that are healthy, that tastes good
希望这部分食物
but they're hopefully they're pretty easy to
能被大家都吃到
get all that different people have different access
但是多巴胺
to things, of course, but dopamine
与体验愉悦感无关
isn't about the ability to experience pleasure.
这是让你有多大的动力去实现这些乐趣
It's about how motivated you are to reach those pleasures.
你们中可能有很多人在想  哇
And so many of you are probably thinking, wow
我不是一个很上进的人
I'm not a very motivated person.
就像你说的那样
Like you talked
拖延症中的一种
about the one kind of procrastination earlier.
当我对生活感到就那么一点满足时该怎么办
What about when I just feel kind of met about life now
对于你们中的某些人来说  可能是真正的临床抑郁症
for some of you, there may be a real clinical depression
你应该和专业人士谈谈
and you should talk to a professional.
有很好的处方药
There are very good prescription drugs
可以真正帮助人们
that can really help people.
心理疗法中也有很好的非药物疗法
There's also great non drug treatments of psychotherapy
还有其他正在开发的治疗方法
and other treatments that are being developed
除了各种心理治疗
in addition to psychotherapy in the various kinds
心理分析等等
of psychoanalysis, et cetera, that one can use.
我认为数据确实指出
I think the data really points
药理学和言语疗法的结合  通常是最好的
to the fact that a combination of pharmacology and talk therapies are generally best.
这些事情的范围很广
And there are a huge range of these things.
我知道你们中很多人都从事这些职业
I know many of you are in these professions.
我们现在不再谈论这个
We're not gonna talk about that right now.
有一个东西
There's a compound.
很有趣  在补剂中
That's kind of interesting in the supplement
没有刺毛黧豆  左旋多巴
space that isn't MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA
不是L酪氨酸  不能促进大量多巴胺释放
it's not L tyrosine that isn't promoting massive releases
甚至不是多巴胺本身
of dopamine or even dopamine alone
而是多巴胺和血清素的组合
but a combination of dopamine and serotonin.
这是一个有趣的分子  它在柜台上出售
And it's an intriguing molecule it's sold over the counter.
同样  你必须向你的医疗保健提供者咨询
Again, you have to check with your healthcare provider
在你采取任何行动或去掉任何行动之前
before you would take anything or remove anything.
这很重要  就是苯乙胺
That's very important, which is, but it's, fenal ethyl
苯乙胺  或PEA
Phenethylamine, or P-E-A pea or beta ethylamine
旨在释放低水平的多巴胺
aiming releases dopamine at low levels
而且也会释放低水平的血清素
but also serotonin and low level.
所以有点像动力分子的混合物
So it's kind of a cocktail of the motivation molecules
或者说是“这里+现在”分子
as well as the quote unquote here and now molecules.
人们对此的反应差异很大
And people's response to this varies widely
但是很多人说感觉增强了
but many people report feeling heightened sense
精神敏锐度等等
of mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera.
有点想刺激物
It is a bit of a stimulant
就像任何触发激活多巴胺
like anything that triggers activation
和去甲肾上腺素通路的作用
of the dopamine and norepinephrine pathway
但这是一个有趣的补剂
but is an interesting supplement.
我实际上从未尝试过
I actually haven't tried it before.
因此  我无法诉说自己的经历
So I can't report on my own experiences.
不过  我会推荐你要访问examine.com
I will point you however, to examine.com.
如果我不说这就不是Huberman Lab播客了
It wouldn't be a Huberman Lab Podcast episode If I didn't point you to examine.com
这个令人难以置信的免费资源  你可以在其中搜索
this incredible free resource where you can put
任何补剂
in any supplement.
它将告诉你“人类影响矩阵”
And it will tell you the quote unquote human effect
会为你指出各种研究
matrix it'll point you to the various studies.
我们始终在标题中提供这个链接
We always provide a link to this in the caption.
这是一个了不起的资源
It's an amazing resource.
所以你可以去那里探索更多信息
So you can go there to explore more
但我还没有谈论β-苯乙胺
but I haven't talked about Phenethylamine
之前的播客中
and before in previous podcasts
我想将其添加到接入多巴胺系统的物质列表中
and I wanted to add it to the list of things that tap into the dopamine system that are in this.
我想我们现在称之为补剂空间
I guess we call it now the supplementation space.
我个人对这些补品着迷
I personally am fascinated by these supplements
因为它们是一种
and the things that exist out there that are
似乎至少是非处方药
non-prescription that seem to, at least
然后在某些人中产生了积极作用
in some people have positive effects.
例如  最后一集
For instance, last episode
我们谈到了CDOT左旋肉碱
we talked about CDOT L-carnitine, which there
还有几篇报告抗抑郁作用的论文
are several papers that report antidepressant effects
以及在其他方面积极的影响
as well as positive effects
精子健康  卵巢健康等等
on other things, sperm health, ovarian health, et cetera.
我从同事那里得知  在欧洲
I learned from a colleague that acetyl L-carnitine
乙酰左旋肉碱实际上是处方药
in Europe is actually a prescription drug
在美国  它是通过柜台出售的
in the US it's sold over the counter.
所以我想  这取决于你所处的位置
So I guess, depending on where you're listening to this
可能购买限制会有所不同
the availability might vary.
和往常一样  我要警告一下  你必须仔细
And as always, I put the caveat, you have to check
与你的医疗保健提供者联系  看看它是否适合你
with your healthcare provider, if it's right for you
但是我对一些
but I'm fascinated by the fact
这种介于处方药和不作任何处理的这种补剂很有兴趣
that these things exist and that they lie somewhere between prescription drugs and doing nothing.
这使它们成为有趣的化合物
And that makes them interesting compounds.
我认为PEA β-苯乙胺
And I think that P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine is
就是这些化合物中的一个
yet another one of the, of such compounds.
我将在未来的一期中  谈论很多关于注意力不足
I going to talk a lot about attention deficit
和注意缺陷多动障碍的问题
and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
但我今天想提一提
in a future episode, but I do wanna mention it today
在多巴胺和冲动的背景下
in the context of dopamine and impulsivity.
ADHD或ADD
So ADHD or ADD so attention deficit
临床诊断的多动症
hyperactivity disorder, ADD our clinical diagnoses.
我想  今天很多人都在说
I think a lot of people nowadays walk around and say
啊 我有多动症  你有多动症
I have ADD or you have ADD
的确 如果你的注意力经常性地切换
and indeed one can create a sort
很有可能会患上注意缺陷障碍
of ADD by attention switching all the time.
我是Cal Newport的忠实粉丝
I'm a big fan of Cal Newport.
他写了《深度工作》一书
He wrote the book" deep work."
我记得  他说了环境切换
I believe he was the one who said context
对大脑来说是可怕的
switching is terrible for the brain.
这就是大脑最糟糕的事情
It's like the worst thing for the brain
因为然后大脑学习一个环境  切换
because then the brain learns to context, switch
然后真正的深层工作效率  各种学习
and real deep work productivity, learning of all kinds
各种良好的关系
good relationships of all kinds
都来自经验的深度
really come from depth of experience
而并非经验的广度
not from breadth of experience within the moment.
因此  我认为了解这一点很重要
And so I think it's important to know that
有临床ADHD和ADD
there's clinical ADHD and ADD
还有一种人是
and then there's the kind that people are kind
通过社交网络  手机等等东西被分心
of inducing and through distraction and social media and phones, et cetera.
这些有时会导致临床ADHD和ADD
And those can sometimes lead to clinical ADHD and ADD
但是我想简单地谈谈小孩子的ADHD和ADD
But I wanna talk about ADHD and ADD in kids just briefly
通常用于治疗这些疾病的药物
the drugs that are normally given to treat those conditions
比如Adderall之类的东西
ADHD and ADD are things like Adderall
里面都有小剂量的苯丙胺
things that have very amphetamine, light qualities
你可能会问  为什么要这样做？
and structures, and you might ask, why would they do that?
好吧  事实证明  这种物质作用在孩子身上
Well, it turns out that in kids
会激活一些大脑通路
these activate that for brain circuitry
激活更深的中边缘通路中的中断
the break that exists on the deeper mesolimbic circuitry.
因此  你还记得有VTA和伏隔核
So as you recall, there's the VTA and nucleus accumbens
作为多巴胺的促进剂
as the kind of accelerators on dopamine.
然后是前额叶皮层
And then there's the prefrontal cortex
这是一个刹车  可以限制冲动
which acts as a break and can limit impulsivity.
这些药物往往会增加该途径的神经元活性
And those drugs tend to increase the activity
激活额叶前皮层
of neurons in that pathway, the prefrontal cortex
并减少冲动
and it reduces impulsivity.
实际上  “the molecule of more”这本书中
In fact, there's a experiment described in the book
描述了一个实验  非常有趣
"the molecule of more," which is really interesting
他们研究肥胖儿童的冲动
where they looked at impulsivity in obese children
原来  他们做了这么一个实验
and it turns out they did this experiment
以安全的方式看着孩子们
in a safe way that they looked at kids
肥胖的孩子和非肥胖的孩子
both obese kids and non obese kids
观察他们穿越繁忙的高速公路的意愿
and their willingness to cross a very busy highway.
事实证明  肥胖儿童被车撞到的次数
And it turns out that the obese kids got hit
比非肥胖儿童更多
by cars more often than non obese children.
这是一个虚拟现实的实验
It turns out this was a virtual reality experiment
这与他们的肥胖
and it had nothing to do with the fact that they were obese
动作不灵敏  或运动速度的限制没有关系
or limitations on movement or speed of movement.
而是因为肥胖的孩子更容易冲动
It was that the obese children were more impulsive
在各种情况下
in a variety of contexts
不只是在这个虚拟过马路的东西上
not just in this virtual crossing the street thing.
结果是  数据都指向一个事实
And it turns out the data point to the fact
10岁时的冲动实际上是可以预测
that impulsivity at age 10 is actually predictive
在之后生命中暴饮暴食的疾病的产生
of overeating disorders at a later stage in life.
因此  其中一些药物旨在
So some of these drugs that are designed to
增强制动系统的活动性
create heightened activity in the braking system
也就是奖赏通路的减速器
the decelerator
目的是减少冲动
of the reward pathway are designed to reduce impulsivity
因为它们抑制多巴胺的释放
because they suppress the release of dopamine
希望他们可以让孩子
and they allow, hopefully they allow children and it
以及当他们长大成人之后  更好地控制多巴胺释放时间表
and when they become adults to better control the schedule of dopamine release.
所以现在让我们谈谈什么是多巴胺时间表
So now let's talk about what is a dopamine schedule
以及如何利用这个
and how you can leverage this
来提高动机水平
in order to have heightened levels of motivation
而且不会产生太多的多巴胺
but not get so much dopamine
你遇到的问题或之后不会发生崩溃
that you're experiencing or a crash afterwards.
而且  这样你就可以体验到更多的乐趣
And also, so that you can experience heightened pleasure
从生活的各种追求中体验到乐趣
from the various pursuits that you are engaged in life.
我知道你们很多人都感兴趣
I know many of you are interested
可以让你更有动力的工具
in tools that will allow you to be more motivated
或者集中精力更长一点  睡得更好的工具
to focus longer, sleep better.
毕竟这就是Huberman Lab播客关注的
That's really what the Huberman Lab Podcast is all about
但总是放在
but always framed in the context
神经生物学原理和客观机制这个语境之下讨论
of neuro-biological principles and objective mechanisms.
有一些我们可以应用在多巴胺系统上的工具
There are some tools that we can apply to the dopamine system
以及动力  可以真正改善我们的
and motivation that can really improve our ability to stay
追求事物  实现目标后享受事物的能力
in pursuit of things, as well as enjoy things
甚至改变路线  去达到我们的目标
after we've achieved our goals, or even an route, our goals.
接下来讲一下关键原则
And here's the key principle.
多巴胺是非常主观的
Dopamine is very subjective.
意思是你可以
Meaning you can
要么让自己体验实现一个里程碑式的目标的快乐
either allow yourself to experience the pleasure
或者不去享受这种快乐
of reaching a milestone of achieving or some craving or not.
在极端的毒品情况下  这行不通
Now that won't work in the extreme cases of drugs
像可卡因和苯丙胺
like cocaine and amphetamine, but it's actually
但实际上  人们可以用主观系统完成这个事情  很厉害
pretty powerful what one can do with the subjective system.
实际上  我要说一个实验
In fact, I'm gonna describe
这个实验重点说明了
to you an experiment that highlights just how
特定经验的主观读出
powerful the subjective readout
或主观解释
or the subjective interpretation
可以有多么的强大
of a given experience really can be.
甚至跟吃药一样
Even at the level of pharmacology.
我喜欢主观因素
I love examples of subjective effects
作用在原本似乎无法改变事情上的例子
over things that would otherwise seem hardwired
因为它们确实说明了
because they really illustrate the interplay
在我们的认知  我们的信仰体系之间的相互作用
between our cognition, our belief system
而其他则是一些
and what would otherwise be these,
立即见效的机制
just plug and chug kind of mechanisms of,
你吃多少量的巧克力
you eat X amount of chocolate
或者在脱水一段时间之后
or you drink X amount of water
你喝多少的水
after being water deprived for a certain amount of time.
然后你得到X的多巴胺
And you get X amount of dopamine.
接下来讲一下实验
Here's the experiment.
该实验刚刚于2021年3月18日发布
The experiment was just published on March 18, 2021.
所以是个很新很新的实验
So very recently, and the title
实验的标题是
of the experiment is
“对兴奋剂类型的期望 会改变咖啡因对情绪和认知的影响”
expectation for stimulant type modifies caffeine is effects on mood and cognition
这是本科学生完成的
and this was done in college students.
这是一个令人着迷的研究
And it's a fascinating study.
他们所做的是给大学生服用了安慰剂
What they did is they gave college students either placebo
一组没有  另一组含有200毫克咖啡因
essentially nothing or 200 milligrams of caffeine.
200毫克咖啡因大概是
200 milligrams of caffeine is
一杯咖啡
about what's in a well, a typical coffee
就像一般的咖啡  你购买的滴滤咖啡
like a medium coffee that you buy a drip coffee
或你在家自制的咖啡
or a coffee that you'd make at home.
差不多就这么多的咖啡因
It's a fair amount of caffeine.
如果你要服用药丸
If you were to take in pill form
它肯定会让你感到更警觉
it would definitely make you feel more alert
除非你是那些突变者之一
unless you were one of those mutants
就是对咖啡因不敏感的突变体
literally mutants that is insensitive to caffeine.
这些突变体非常罕见
And those mutants are pretty rare.
因此  他们召集了65名大学本科学生
So they took 65 undergraduate students in college.
他们将它们随机分配到安慰剂或咖啡因中
They randomized them to either placebo or caffeine
告诉受试者
and they told them
他们正在摄取咖啡因或Adderall
that they were either getting caffeine or Adderall.
Adderall在认知上
Now, Adderall cognitively carries
代表着完全不同的期望
a very different expectation.
大学生知道Adderall刺激性非常强
College students know Adderall to be a much
刺激性比咖啡因强
stronger stimulant than caffeine.
他们知道它会创造出一种嗨感
They know it to create a sort of high.
这是学生描述它的方式
This is the way the students described it
他们认为这会提高他们
and they thought that it would increase their level
专注力和执行工作的水平
of focus and their ability to perform work.
所以真的很有趣
So it was really interesting is there was definitely
其中肯定有安慰剂与咖啡因的作用
an effect of placebo versus caffeine.
这并不奇怪  但是  对了  你服用了安慰剂
That's not surprising, however, right, you take a placebo
你可能会或可能不会感到更警觉
you may or may not feel more alert
但是你要摄取200毫克的咖啡因
but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine
你很有可能会感到非常警觉
very likely you're gonna feel very alert
但学生们以为他们正在喝咖啡因或Adderall
but there was also an effect of whether or not
不同兴奋剂的种类  也会产生很大的影响
the students thought they were getting caffeine or Adderall.
接受咖啡因的受试者报告
The subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
感觉更加激动  焦虑和上进
more stimulated, anxious, and motivated
比接受安慰剂的受试者要多
than the subjects that received the placebo.
好的  但是那些认为是Adderall的人
Okay. But the ones that expected Adderall
报告了更强的苯丙胺作用
reported stronger amphetamine effects.
所以他们感觉更嗨
So they felt much more high.
他们在工作记忆测试中表现更好
They performed better on a working memory test.
总体而言  他们的认知能力都有所提高
And in general, they had all the increased cognitive
因为他们觉得自己吃的是Adderall
effects that would have been seen with Adderall
但是他们摄入的只是咖啡因
but they were only ingesting caffeine.
因此  这表明咖啡因药物和以为是Adderall的期望之间
And so this shows an interaction between the drug caffeine
存在相互作用
and the expectation that it was Adderall.
因此  就这么简单地提高了受试者的表现
So it led to heightened performance simply
因为学生们以为他们正在服用Adderall
because the students thought they were getting Adderall.
但是我不知道
And I don't know whether
他们最后有没有告诉受试者这不是Adderall
or not they told them at the end that it wasn't Adderall.
我不太清楚
I doubt that they did this.
如果你想查一下
If you wanna look it up
该研究发表在
the study was published in the journal
临床临床心理药理学研究期刊上
of experimental clinical psychopharmacology.
这篇论文是Looby LOOBY
The paper is Looby L-O-O-B-Y at all.
再说一次  它刚发表于2021年3月18日
And again, it was just published March 18th, 2021 speaks
是的  有所谓的安慰剂效应
to the fact that yes, there are so-called placebo effects
但这不同于安慰剂效应
but this is different than placebo.
这是对给定刺激物的固有期待
This is a belief effect about what the specific reactions
这种信念在影响
to a given stimulant ought to be.
我认为这非常重要  因为我认为
And I think this is very important because I think
它指出了一个事实  即自上而下的调节
that it points to the fact that the top
即更高层次的认知过程
down the kind of higher level cognitive processes
甚至可以影响最基本的神经递质
are impacting even the most basic fundamental aspects
比如说多巴胺的释放
of the say dopamine release
或我们的肾上腺素释放的量
or our mountain adrenaline release or epinephrin release
可以对我们的表现产生积极影响
in ways that can positively impact performance.
在这种情况下  这是在工作记忆和注意力方面
In this case, it was a positive improvement
一个积极的进步
in working memory and focus.
只要我们在谈论咖啡因
As long as we were talking about caffeine
我想指出一项研究
I'd like to point out a study.
真的很有趣
That's really interesting.
这发表在神经科学杂志上
This was published in journal of neuroscience
这是一本
which is the society
神经科学界的标杆期刊
for neurosciences kind of flagship journal.
就是它
It's their journal.
这是非常棒的期刊
It's a good journal
他们表明的是
and what they showed was
咖啡因可以增加多巴胺在大脑中的释放
that caffeine can increase dopamine release
大概提高30％
in the brain by about 30%.
这不足为奇
That wasn't surprising.
我早先也这么说过  但他们也表明了
I even said that earlier, but what they also showed is
咖啡因对多巴胺神经元有保护作用
that it has a protective effect on dopamine neurons.
因此  在某些情况下  咖啡因可能不只是
So caffeine in some cases may not just
增加多巴胺释放
increase dopamine release
但实际上可能有保护作用
but it might actually have a protective effect
在多巴胺神经元上
on dopamine neurons.
现在有明显的不同
Now that's distinctly different
从一些声称  像MTMA摇头丸的药物
from some claims that drugs like MTMA ecstasy have been
已经被认为  有神经毒性
it's been argued can, are neurotoxic
对多巴胺和血清素神经元之类的东西有毒性
for things like dopamine and serotonin neurons.
发表的有关该问题的研究
The study that was published about that
在《科学》期刊上
in the journal science, which is an extremely
也是一本久负盛名的优秀期刊
prestigious excellent journal later, it was shown
表明  不是MTMA摇头丸的作用
that it wasn't MTMA ecstasy that was given in that case.
实际上是苯丙胺的作用
It was actually amphetamine, which is known to
破坏多巴胺能和血清素能神经元
destroy dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons.
那么这是什么意思？
So what does this mean?
这意味着  在一些研究中表明 含量低的咖啡因
This means that low levels of caffeine may at least
随着时间的流逝 可能至少对多巴胺神经元具有保护作用
in a few studies be protective for dopamine neurons
MTMA摇头丸是
over time that MTMA ecstasy something that's
目前在临床试验中用于治疗创伤
in clinical trials right now for the treatment of trauma
各种PTSD和抑郁症的药物
PTSD of various kinds and depression
但目前仍可能是非法的
but still illegal at this point in time may
尽管尚未从任何已发表的研究中出现
although it doesn't appear yet from any published studies
MTMA摇头丸会破坏多巴胺能神经元  可能是紧急神经元
destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps origin, urgent neuron.
所以这里需要抱有疑问的态度
So there's a real asterix and a question mark there
但苯丙胺  尤其是甲基苯丙胺
but amphetamine and in particular methamphetamine
对多巴胺能神经元具有非常强的破坏性
is very destructive for dopaminergic neurons.
所以我认为我们任何人都没有什么理由
So I don't think any of us needed any additional
要去使用甲基苯丙胺
reasons to avoid methamphetamine.
这种药物会导致多巴胺的大量增加
This drug that creates huge increases in dopamine
然后发生严重的崩溃
and then huge crashes
破坏性非常强的药物
from that dopamine, very destructive drug.
但是除此之外
But in addition
似乎会破坏时间的多巴胺能神经元
to that seems to destroy dopaminergic neurons from time
到时候  我在这里谈论尼古丁  不是吸烟哈
to time, I've talked about nicotine on here, not smoking
因为显然吸烟有害  有肺癌的危害
because obviously smoking is bad lung cancer's bad
对健康不好  但尼古丁为补剂
for health, et cetera, but nicotine in supplemental form
我已经提到一位非常著名的神经科学家
I've mentioned that a very famous neuroscientists
诺贝尔奖得主  这位科学家选择了尼古丁片
Nobel prize winning scientists choose a lot of Nicorette.
我知道其他一些人也在嚼尼古丁片
I know other people that you Nicorette
他们相信它的神经保护作用
they believe in its neuroprotective effects
可以防止帕金森氏症和阿尔茨海默氏症
for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
尼古丁确实可以刺激多巴胺释放
and indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
我们之前谈到过
We talked about that earlier
但是否具有保护作用
whether or not it has a protective effect
尚不清楚  这个保护作用可能是
isn't clear the protective effects might be
通过去甲肾上腺素和乙酰胆碱系统产生的
through the noradrenergic and acetylcholine systems.
这些发现仍然不清楚
Those findings are still unclear
但值得注意的是
but it is interesting to note
尼古丁可以增加催乳素
that nicotine can increase prolactin.
不知道为什么就是这样
Somewhat. There are a couple
研究中有一对情侣  我很乐意在简介中放入他们的研究链接
of studies I'd be happy to link to them
他们的研究表明  如果尼古丁摄入过多
in the caption that shows that nicotine taken too much
摄入过长时间  会增加催乳素
over too long periods of time can also increase prolactin
这又是多巴胺的另一面
which again is the opposite side of dopamine.
所以今天我们讨论了多巴胺系统
So today we've talked a lot about the dopamine system
以及那些可以让他们产生渴望或者成瘾的时间表
and those kinds of schedules that will allow craving
但是多巴胺的时间表怎么样
or addiction, but what's the schedule of dopamine.
才能让你最大化
That's going to allow you to maximize
去追求快乐和消除痛苦
on your pursuit of pleasure and your elimination of pain.
我们从我们的好朋友赌博中得到了答案
And we get the answer to that
赌博会上瘾的原因
from our good friend gambling, the reason gambling works
人们会在赌博中不顾一切
the reason why people will throw their lives away.
抛家弃子一次又一次回去
The reason why people go back again and again and again
回到拉斯维加斯和大西洋城之类的地方
to places like Las Vegas and Atlantic city is
是因为希望和期待
because of the hope and anticipation it's
因为这些城市就正是建立在多巴胺之上的地方
as those are cities in places built on dopamine,
他们正在利用你的多巴胺系统
they are leveraging your dopamine system.
我意识到有些经验丰富的赌徒
And I realized that there are experienced gamblers.
有些人享受赌博
There are people that enjoy gambling.
我实际上只想说
I'll actually just say,
我喜欢坐在轮盘赌桌上
I like sitting at the roulette table.
我当时拿了指定的金额
I was take a designated amount of money.
数量不多  我喜欢玩轮盘赌
It's not much, I enjoy playing a little bit of roulette.
当我赢的时候  我当然很享受
I certainly enjoy when I win.
我输的时候 我当然不喜欢
I certainly don't like it when I lose
但是我很乐意  为玩而高兴
but I do it cheerly for the pleasure of playing.
而且我很少这样做
And I do it very seldom.
我没有赌博的问题
I don't have a gambling problem.
如果我真有了  我会告诉你们的
And if I did, I'd probably tell you
但我没有赌博问题
but I don't have a gambling problem.
然而有些人却因为赌博 命都不要了
Yet people throw away the entire lives on gambling.
我的一位朋友
And as a friend of mine
一位成瘾治疗专家  告诉我
who's a certified addiction treatment specialist tells me
赌博成瘾特别危险
that gambling addiction is a particularly sinister
因为每一个下一次
because the next time really could be the thing
都可能会赢  会改变一切
that changes everything.
与其他成瘾不同
Unlike other addictions
赌博的每一个下次真的可以改变一切
the next time really could change everything.
这就是赌博成瘾者的内心深处的想法
And that's embedded in the mind of the gambling addict
而对于却完全破坏了
and rarely does it work out in favor
瘾君子及其家人的幸福感
of the wellbeing of the gambling addict and their family.
但是  间歇性加固计划
However, the intermittent reinforcement schedule
是很久以前由科学研究人员发现的
was discovered long ago by scientific researchers.
比如老虎机
So this is the slot machine that every once
过一会儿给你带来一点甜头  让你保持参与状态
in a while gives you a wind to keep you playing.
这是在掷骰子桌上获胜的概率
This is the, the probability of winning on the craps table
或轮盘赌桌  或二十一点
or the roulette table, or at blackjack just often enough
都让你心甘情愿地去买飞机票  去那里一赌为快
that you're willing to buy tickets, head out there
再次你从赌场离开之后
play again, go downstairs again from your room
即使你发誓  之后再也不赌了
even though you swore you were done for the night
“间歇式加固”是多巴胺奖励时刻表中最强大的一种形式
intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful form of dopamine reward schedule
让你继续做某事
 to keep you doing something
但我们反过来利用它了
so we can export that.
我们可以永远使用它
We can use it for good.
如果你在生活中追求某种东西
If there's something that you're pursuing in life
不管是一个学术目标
whether or not it's an academic goal
或财务目标  关系目标
or a financial goal, a relationship goal.
你可以确保做的一件事
One of the things that you can do to ensure
你将继续朝着那个目标前进
that you will remain on the path to that goal
很长一段时间  
for a very long time, and that you will continue to
你将继续超过了你以前的表现
exceed your previous performance as well
当你达到想要的里程碑时
as continue to enjoy the dopamine release that
继续享受多巴胺的释放
occurs when you hit the milestones that you want to
那就是主观上“偶尔删除奖励”
achieve is to occasionally remove reward
 假设你设定了一个目标
subjectively, let's say you set out a goal of making
我要对财务进行量化
I'm gonna make this quantitative with respect to finances
因为这只是一个简单的例子
'cause it just is an easy description
但这也可以应用在运动中
but this could also be in sport.
这可以应用在学校学习
This could be in school.
可以是音乐
This could be in music
可以从事任何创造性的工作
could be in anything creative endeavors
但假设你设定了特定的财务目标
but let's say you set out a certain financial goal
或假设你想获得一定数量
or let's say you wanna get a certain number
在任何社交媒体平台上的关注者
of followers on whatever social media platform
当你实现这些目标中的每个目标时
as you reach each one of those goals.
你现在应该知道
You should know now that the amount
多巴胺的释放量不会达到顶峰
of dopamine is not going to peak.
实际上会减少
It's actually going to diminish
并让你渴望更多   避免崩溃的关键
and make you crave more the key to avoiding that crash
但要保持在健康水平
but to still keep it in healthy levels
因为那样才能让你继续你的追求
that will allow you to continue.
随着你朝着目标迈进
Your pursuit is as you are, stair casing toward your goal.
也许是美元  也许是关注者
Maybe that's dollars, maybe that's followers
也许那是成绩
maybe that's grades
也许这是奖牌或奖杯  什么其他指标
maybe that's some other metric it's metals or trophies.
你实际上需要钝化奖励响应
You actually want to blunt the reward response
对于其中一些中间目标
for some of those intermediate goals.
现在我不是告诉你不能庆祝自己的胜利
Now I'm not telling you should celebrate your wins
但我在告诉你  不要庆祝所有这些
but I'm telling you not to celebrate all of them.
而我的一个好朋友最近
Whereas a good friend of mine who recently
幸运的是  他在财务上取得了巨大的成功
fortunately for him had a great financial success.
他问我和其他人我的好朋友
He asked me and somebody else a good friend of mine.
那个人非常适应多巴胺奖励时间表
Who's very tuned into dopamine
很了解其工作原理
reward schedules understands how they work
非常深的理解
at a really deep level.
他说：“我不知道下一步该怎么做”
And he said," I don't know what to do next."
我们说：“哦  那很简单
And we said," Oh, well, that's simple,
你应该只将其中的大部分捐献出去”
You should just give most of it away."
这不是什么骗钱的手段
And this wasn't a ploy to receive any of the money ourselves.
这实际上是关于减少奖励的影响
This was really about reducing the impact of that reward.
希望把钱捐献出去
Now hopefully giving them money away.
如果你已经有了足够多的钱
If you already have enough
这种行为本身就是一种奖励
of it would be something that was rewarding in and of itself.
但是如果你是一个追求大学目标的学生
But if you're a student who's pursuing goals in university
或者你是一个追求目标的运动员
or you're an athlete, who's pursuing goals
从理性的角度来看  这实际上是有道理的
it actually makes sense from a rational perspective.
一旦了解了这些机制  你就可以达到新的表现高峰
Once you understand these mechanisms to hit a new high point
获得A+
of performance, or to get that A-plus or a for you
或者如果是A-等
if it's an A-minus, et cetera
就是告诉自己  好吧  那很好
and to tell yourself, okay, that was good.
但而且要去主动挫败那种奖励
But to actually actively blunt the reward to not go
不要过分地庆祝  因为这样做
and celebrate too intensely, because in doing that
你才能保证多巴胺系统稳定  并确保
you keep your dopamine system in check and you ensure
你将继续走下去的道路
that you're gonna stay on the path of continued pursuit
不只是为了那件事  而且为了所有事情  
not just for that thing, but for all things big increases
多巴胺中大幅度增加  会导致严重的崩溃
in dopamine leads to big crashes
提高多巴胺的增加的门槛
in dopamine and big increases in dopamine up the ante.
你会更加愿意去花更多时间和精力
They increase the extent to which you are willing to
去实现一个超出你能力的目标
invest time and energy in order to achieve goals
以及得到可能无法获得的奖励
and rewards that may be out of your reach.
你永远不会真正知道自己是否会成功
You never really know if you're going to succeed.
因此  为了把这个说得更清楚  庆祝你的胜利
So to make this crystal clear, celebrate your wins
但不要庆祝每一次胜利
but don't celebrate every win.
这是你可以确保
That's one way that you can ensure
你将继续前进的一种方法
that you're going to continue down the path of progress.
我认为在学校里的大多数学习工具
And I think most of the learning tools that are
是对于对真正表现好的奖励
in schools are about reward for genuine performance.
他们是在鼓励我们
They are about encouraging us.
我们确实必须相信我们可以表现良好
We do have to believe that we can perform well.
成长心态的标志之一就是
One of the hallmarks of growth mindset is
内在化  我们还没有做好
the internalization that we're not getting it right yet.
“还”这个字很重要
The word yet is very important.
还有我们奖励的感觉
And also the sense that we reward
我们的良好行为  良好的业绩  但并非每次都如此
our good behavior, our good performance, but not every time.
一种方法是实际获得奖励
One way to do this is to actually take the reward
并用自己的双手和头脑进行加固
and reinforcement out of your own hands and your own mind.
然后你告诉某人  
And you tell somebody that they are in control of
他们在控制  你能够对自己的胜利感到高兴
whether or not you're allowed to feel good about your wins.
我意识到对于大多数人来说这是非常不自然的
Now, I realize it's very unnatural for most people
但是如果你是一个只会追求的人
but if you're somebody who simply going to be in pursuit
而且你将真正记录自己的胜利  并且你认为
and you're going to really register your wins, and you think
那实际上会让你表现更好
that that's gonna actually make you a better performer
它会在短期内发生  但从长远来看不会
it will in the short term, but not in the longterm.
这样你就可以解除拉斯维加斯
So you can lift the what Las Vegas
和大西洋城等赌博机制
and Atlantic city and other gambling mechanisms
这种地方
and places have known for a long time.
他们从科学家那里拿走了它
They lifted it from the scientists.
你现在可以将其收回  并可以开始利用它了
You can now take it back and you can start to leverage that.
而你只要断断续续地实施
And you just make it intermittent.
你奖励自己  而不是按可预见的时间表
You reward yourself, not on a predictable schedule
所以不是每隔两次或第三次
so not every other time or every third time
或每10次  但可以突然3次
or every 10th time, but sometimes it's three
然后连续十天都没有
in a row then not at all for 10 days.
因此  奖励很重要
So reward is important.
自我奖励至关重要
Self reward is critically important
但请确保你没有
but make sure that you're not doing it
按照如此循规蹈矩的时间表
on such a predictable schedule that you burn
它们会耗尽你的多巴胺循环
out these dopamine circuits or
削弱你的奋斗和实现能力
that you undercut your own ability to strive and achieve.
其实有一个研究生院的故事
Actually have a story from graduate school
我被迫
which I was forced
进入间歇性加固计划
into an intermittent reinforcement schedule
我确实相信对我有很好的帮助
that I do believe has served me very well
在我的科学生涯和生活的其他方面
in my scientific career and other aspects of life.
我的研究生顾问是一位了不起的科学家
My graduate advisor was an amazing scientist.
不幸的是她已经去世了
Unfortunately, she passed away
但是她是一位杰出的科学家和杰出的人
but amazing scientists and amazing human being
带有一种枯燥无趣且有些残酷的幽默感
with a very dry and somewhat cruel sense of humor.
她的名字叫芭芭拉·查普曼（Barbara Chapman）  我们发表了一篇论文
Her name was Barbara Chapman, and we published a paper
在《科学》期刊上  
in the journal, science and science nature
《科学》《自然》和《细胞》被认为是科学期刊三巨头
and cell are considered the big three
最有竞争力的期刊
the most competitive journals to publish in.
所以那时候我在《科学》上发表了第一篇论文
And I had a first author paper in science.
我真的很兴奋
It was really exciting to me.
我只是研究生
I was a graduate student.
我为这个发现感到非常兴奋
I was very excited about the discovery.
我很兴奋这可是发表在《科学》上诶
I was excited that it was in science.
我很激动
I was just thrilled.
我记得当论文最终被接受时
And I remember when the paper finally got accepted
因为它涉及了很多
because it had involved a ton
修订和很多艰苦的工作
of revisions and a lot of very hard work.
她进来  说：“论文被接受了”
And she came in and she said," paper got accepted."
我非常兴奋
I was super excited
她只是坐在那里点点头  我说
and she just kind of sat there and nodded, and I said
“我们要庆祝吗？ 要办个趴体吗？
"are we gonna celebrate, are we gonna have a party?"
还是  我们将要做什么啊？”
Or what, like, what are we gonna do it?
然后  我永远不会忘记她的回答
And I'll never forget her answer.
她说：“emmm....
She said," Emm
...我认为我们应该跳过这一步”
I think we should skip this one."
我以为她在开玩笑
And I thought she was joking.
我说：“啥意思啊  跳过这一步？
And I said," what do you mean skip this one?"
我们要发论文了诶！”
We're gonna publish the paper.
她说  “没错 是要发了”
He said, yeah, we're gonna publish the paper.
但她说：“也许当你再发个四篇
But she said, " maybe when you get like four more
三篇  两篇？”
maybe three, maybe two too."
我以为她在开我玩笑
And I thought she was messing
 她并没有开玩笑
with me and she wasn't messing with me.
她是对的
And she was right.
我们从来没有开过派对
We never had a party.
我们没有为那篇论文举行任何的庆祝活动
We had a celebration for that paper.
我认为她真的是在向我灌输两个想法
I think she was really trying to instill two ideas in me.
一个是工作本身就应该是
One is that the work itself was what was supposed to
最具有奖励意义的
be most rewarding.
实验的实践
That practice of experimentation
写论文  
a writing the paper, the experience
实现目标非常努力的经验
of achieving something they worked very hard at
确实的确令人惊讶
and that did indeed feel amazing.
我实际上仍然可以在我的体内感觉到它
I actually can still feel it in my body.
很兴奋
Now, the excitement.
因此  还有一种多巴胺释放
So there's a, still a dopamine release
否则弧线会持续很长时间
or that arc is going very long.
既然已经发生  那将是20年前
This would be almost 20 years ago now that this happened.
所以这很了不起
So that's remarkable.
另一个是她是对的
The other one is that she's right.
我们从来没有出去庆祝
We never went out and celebrated
我们确实庆祝了其他胜利
and we did celebrate other wins
将来的其他论文以及类似的事情
other papers in the future and things of that sort.
但是她要么有意识地或无意识地把我
But she was either consciously or subconsciously putting me
按照间歇性的奖励时间表来培养
on an intermittent reward schedule.
直到今天  发生了一些非常好的事情
And to this day when something really good happens
我实际上在犹豫我是否要内在化
I actually hesitate as to whether or not I wanna
还是去庆祝
internalize that and celebrate whether I wanna
我是否想要告诉其他人 作为庆祝的方式
tell anybody which is its own form of celebration
因为这样你会获得更多正面的反馈
because then you're getting positive feedback.
所以我非常谨慎
And so I'm very cautious
我如何部署多巴胺释放以应对胜利
with how I deploy dopamine release in response to wins.
当然  这不是我探索事业
It's certainly not the only way that I've
唯一的方法
navigated my career.
我加入了许多其他原则
There are a number of other principles I incorporate
但是间歇性的胜利奖励  间歇性的取得成就奖励
but intermittent reward for wins
是一种非常有力的方法  可以确保
for achievements is a very powerful way to ensure
你将继续追求接下去的目标
that you will stay on the path of pursuit.
那么现在
At this point in the podcast
我想花点时间声明一些更正
I'd like to take a moment to address some corrections.
我在前几集中犯了一些错误
I made some errors in previous episodes.
它们不是主要错误
They weren't major errors
但你们指出了一些
but a couple of you pointed them out
对我来说  我们追求准确性非常重要
and it's important to me that we strive for accuracy.
所以第一个是我在上一集中谈到的
So the first one was I talked in a previous episode
关于某些人（不是全部）的潜在利益
about the potential benefits for some people, not all
醉茄的药理作用及其在皮质醇钝化中的作用
of ashwagandha and its role in blunting cortisol
以及抵消中期压力
and a way of offsetting medium term,
和一些长期的压力的方法
and some long-term stress.
这是我受益的补剂
It's a supplement that I've benefited from.
它通过GABA系统工作
It works through the GABA system
和其他一些系统  有人指出
and some other systems, someone pointed
得出了一项在大鼠中进行的研究
out a study that admittedly was done in rats.
而我在播客中主要是集中与
I point I was focusing mainly
对人体的研究中  但他们指出
on studies in humans during the episode, but they point
在老鼠身上进行的一项研究表明
out a study that was done in rats that showed
对醉茄的长期监控 
that long-term administration of ashwagandha
实际上可能会产生一些负面影响
could actually create some negative effects mainly
在肌瘤甚至皮质醇系统上
on the fibroid and perhaps even the cortisol system
也许是褪黑激素系统
maybe the melatonin system.
我只是想承认这项研究
I just wanna acknowledge that study.
我将在标题中再次引用它
I'll reference it in the caption again
那是一项大鼠研究
that was a rat study.
我专注于人类研究
I was focused on human studies.

放入ashwagandha会告诉你各种效果
Put in ashwagandha will tell you the various effects
在大脑和身体的不同方面

它还将链接到pub med文章
It will also link to the pub med articles
那里相关的论文

它被称为人类效应矩阵
it is called the human effect matrix
因为那只针对人类
'cause that's only focused on humans.
这就是我喜欢examined.com的原因之一
That's one of the reasons I like examined.com
因为它专注于人类研究
as it's focused on human studies, again
很棒的免费资源  但是我很感激
a wonderful free resource, but I do appreciate
你指出那个研究
that you pointed out that study
因为我确实希望人们知道
because I do want people to be aware of the range
这些各种化合物具有的作用的对象范围
of effects that these various compounds can have as well.
前几集几次
A couple of times in previous episodes
我说的是5-HTP  而不是5-ht
I said five HTP and not five HT five
5-HT是血清素 
5-HT is serotonin five
5- HTP是血清素的前体 
5-HTP is a precursor to a serotonin.
我说的是补品
I was talking about supplements
以及能刺激血清素释放的化合物
and compounds that can stimulate the release of serotonin.
在上一集中  我实际上是在指
In the previous episode, I was actually referring
前提是
to it in a context
我个人不喜欢服用5-HTP
for which I don't personally like to take five HTP.
那只是我自己的偏见
That's just my own bias
由于我在那集中描述的原因
for reasons I described in that episode.
但是  如果你听到我说5-HTP
But if you heard me say five HTP
而我想说的其实是5-HT时  我表示歉意
when I meant to say five HT, I apologize.
最后  我只想再次指出
And then last, I just wanna point out again
我一开始提到的东西
something that I mentioned at the beginning
这就是Huberman Lab Podcast开始有西班牙字幕了
which is that the Huberman Lab Podcast is now subtitled
1、2集

以及我们的欢迎视频都是西班牙语
as well as our welcome video are in Spanish.
其他的将很快会有字幕

我再次意识到  我们涵盖了很多内容
I realized once again, we've covered a lot of material.
希望你现在知道更多
Hopefully you now know far more
关于多巴胺系统的奖励和动机
about the dopamine system reward and motivation
比你在本播客开始时要了解的更多
than you did at the beginning of this podcast.
希望你也了解另一面
Hopefully you also understand the other side
多巴胺和奖励  这是痛苦
of dopamine and reward, which is pain
以及这种愉悦痛苦系统的平衡
and the balance of this pleasure pain system, as well
作为我们称为或被描述为“更多”的分子
as the molecules that we call or that were described
在< the molecule of more>书中  我应该说
in the molecule of more book, I should say
作为"这里+现在"分子
as the here and now molecules
诸如血清素和内源性大麻素之类的东西
things like serotonin and the endocannabinoids.

非常有趣的化合物
Very interesting compound again
我从来没有尝试过 但很有趣
I've never tried it very interesting
肯定有人在使用 左旋多巴  刺毛黧豆
definitely in use out there L-DOPA MuCuna
讲了咖啡因  讲了尼古丁
appearings talked about caffeine, talked about nicotine.
谈了一些Adderall的影响
Talk about how some of the effects
完全可以通过认知来创建
of Adderall can be created purely cognitively
无需实际摄取Adderall  只需
without actually ingesting Adderall, simply
通过告诉人们他们正在摄取Adderall
by telling people they're ingesting Adderall
给他们咖啡因
giving them caffeine.
我引用了一个非常有趣的研究
Very interesting study that I referenced a
早些时候
little bit earlier,
我们谈到了安排多巴胺
and we talked about scheduling dopamine
为自己采用间歇性的奖励时间表
adopting the intermittent reward schedule for yourself
为了确保长期参与
in order to ensure long-term engagement
我希望是健康的追求
with pursuits that I hope are healthy pursuits
和那些为你服务的
and ones that serve you well
这绝不是详尽的讲解
this was by no means an exhaustive coverage
所有事物  多巴胺和动力
of all things, dopamine and motivation.
也不是
It was by no means.
我们唯一聊到多巴胺和动机的节目
The only time that we're gonna talk
下一期
about dopamine and motivation, next episode
我们将继续交谈
we're gonna continue to talk
从另一个角度讲情感
about emotions from yet another perspective
但希望你现在有足够的想法

同时  你可以考虑采用
about in the meantime, and that you can consider adopting
在你自己的生活中去用一些方法
in your own life and practices 
一如既往
as always.

我们科学教的一件事
One of the things that we teach
我认为真的很棒的
in science that I think is really wonderful
在生活中普遍采用的是  一个想法
to adopt in general in life is this idea
就是“一看  一做  一教”
of watch one, do one, teach one.
这就是我们告诉研究生和医学生的
This is what we tell graduate students and med students
和博士后  看某人做某事  学习它
and post-docs watch somebody do something, learn it
然后做  应用它  
then do it, apply it, see
看看它是否对你有用  然后教给别人
if it works for you and then teach it.
其实通常不是“一看  一做  一教”
So it's usually not watch one, do one, teach one.
而是“一看”
It's usually watch one
做20遍  然后尽可能多的教别人
do 20 teach as many people as you possibly want.
我不是在寻找归因
I'm not looking for attribution.
这些是扎根的工具
These are tools that are grounded
我在神经科学领域无法声称归因
in neuroscience for which I can't claim attribution.
我只是把它们传播出去
I'm just passing them along so
如果你愿意  可以采用它们并将其传递
that you can adopt them if you like and pass them along.
如果你认为人们可以受益
If you think people can benefit
