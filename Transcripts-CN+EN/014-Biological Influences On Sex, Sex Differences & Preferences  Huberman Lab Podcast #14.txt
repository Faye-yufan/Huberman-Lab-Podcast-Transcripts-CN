睡觉时你会热还是冷？
Do you tend to run hot or cold as you sleep
也许你不知道”
or maybe you don't know?"
那两分钟的测验适合你
That two minute quiz matches you
放在床垫和枕头上
to a mattress and pillow

what vitamins and minerals to take.
在Athletic Greens上
And in Athletic Greens,
我得到所有的维生素和矿物质
I get all the vitamins and minerals
我所有日常所需的维生素
I need to cover my bases.
益生菌也很重要
As well probiotics are really important.
益生菌已在众多研究中显示
Probiotics have been shown now in numerous studies
对肠道微生物组很重要
to be important for the gut microbiome,
会影响肠脑轴
which impacts the gut brain axis,
以及身体健康的各个方面
as well as various aspects of bodily health.
所以在Athletic Greens
So in Athletic Greens
我得到维生素  矿物质和益生菌
I get vitamins, minerals and probiotics.
我也很喜欢它的味道
I also really like the way it tastes.
这是绿色饮料
It's a greens drink,

那是一年的供应和五个免费旅行包
That's a year supply and the five free travel packs.
这是新的一个月
It's a new month,
这意味着这是一个新话题
which means it's a new topic
在Huberman Lab播客上
here at the Huberman Lab Podcast.
对于接下来的大约四集
For the next four or so episodes,
我们将要谈论
we're going to be talking all about
激素会影响大脑和身体的一切
hormone affects on the brain and body.
因此  这是许多不同的主题
So that's a huge number of different topics.
我们将谈论性
We're going to talk about sex.
我们将谈论繁殖
We're going to talk about reproduction.
我们将谈论青春期
We're going to talk about puberty a little bit more.
我们在上一集中谈到了这一点
We talked about that in a previous episode.
我们将谈论更年期
We're going to talk about menopause.
我们将谈论节育
We're going to talk about birth control.
我们将要谈论
We are going to talk about
侵略  竞争  胜利  失败
aggression, competition, winning, losing.
基本上  我们将涵盖有关激素的更多信息
Basically, we're going to cover as much about hormones
尽我们所能
as we possibly can in this month
并且这样做
and in doing so
我们将深入研究工具和协议
we are going to go deep into tools and protocols.
我们还将讨论很多
We are also going to talk about a lot of
与事物相关的工具
tools that relate to things
你可能需要避免去做的事情
that you might not want to do in order to
从而来优化荷尔蒙的健康状况
optimize hormone health,
不论你的人生阶段或你的目标等等
regardless of stage of life or your goals et cetera.
因此  肯定会有一个月的讨论时间
So it's sure to be a month rich with discussion,
拥有丰富的工具  你将学到很多
rich with tools and you're going to learn a lot of
神经科学和内分泌学
neuroscience and endocrinology.
实际上有一个神经内分泌学领域
There's actually a field of neuro-endocrinology.
实际上  这是我开始我的研究生工作的地方
It's actually where I started my graduate work.
我在这方面拿了一个研究生学位
I did a masters in it.
只能说我喜欢这个话题
Which has only to say that I love the topic.
我有很多在这个主题上工作的朋友
I have a lot of friends that work on this topic,
为了这些播客  我咨询过许多人
many of whom I've consulted for these episodes.
所以我很高兴与你们分享这些信息
And I'm really excited to share the information with you.
在我们深入探讨今天的内容之前
Before we dive into today's episode,
“关于情绪和性的一切”
"All About Emotions and Sex."
我只想发布一些公告
I want to just to have a few announcements
旨在为你提供一些有用的资源
that are designed to point you to some useful resources.
最后一集  “谈论
Last episode, "Talking About The Science of
情感和人际关系的科学”
Emotions and Relationships."
我提到了Mood Meter应用程序
I mentioned the Mood Meter app.
情绪计测器应用程式是由
The Mood Meter App was developed by
在耶鲁大学的人
people out at Yale University who study
他们研究情绪的生物学和心理学
the biology and psychology of emotions.
这是一个非常棒的应用程序
It's a really wonderful app.
但是  你们中许多人很快告诉我
However, many of you quickly told me
在你所在的地区没有情绪计测器应用程序
that the Mood Meter App isn't available in your area.
你转到了我们发布的链接
You went to the link we posted
只是说你所在的地区不可用
and it just was saying not available in your area.
情况实际上比那糟得多
The situation was actually a lot worse than that.
情况是
The situation was that,
当我们录制播客时
when we recorded the episode
情绪计测器应用程序是在运作的
the Mood Meter App was working.
我是知道的  因为我下载到了手机中
I know 'cause I downloaded a fresh copy of it to my phone.
然后在随后的周末
And then in the ensuing weekend,
他们关闭了Mood Meter App  进行了一些维修
they took the Mood Meter App down for some repairs.
情绪仪应用程序现在已启动
The Mood Meter app is now up.
它是可用的
It is available.
我想说的很清楚
I want to be really clear.
这不是跟我有商业关系的应用
It's not an app I'm affiliated with.
我只是在给你们推荐
I'm just mentioning it to you.
他们不认识我
They don't know me.
我认识他们  但他们不认识我
I know them, but they don't know me.
因此  我们没有任何业务关系
So we don't have any kind of business relationship.
他们确实为该应用收费99美分
They do charge 99 cents for the app.
我认为免费版本已经消失了
I think the free version has disappeared
在过去的一年左右
in the last year or so.
这就是Mood Meter应用程序
So that's Mood Meter app.
我们将再次提供链接
We'll provide the link again
并且链接应该正常工作
and the link should be working.
希望他们在此公告之间
Hopefully they won't take it down again,
这一期播出的时候
in between this announcement
不会再下架了
and the release of this episode.
也只想退一步
Also just want to take a step back for a moment
谈一点逻辑
and talk a little bit about the logic
如何充分利用信息
of how to make the most of the information
Huberman Lab播客的信息
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
我倾向于抛出很多信息
I tend to throw out a lot of information
关于给定主题
about a given topic.
但是  许多人指出
Many of you have pointed out however,
我没有涵盖某些事情
that I don't cover certain things.
再说一次
And once again I'll just say
目标始终是准确
the goal is always to be accurate,
但我无法穷尽所有
but there's no way I can be exhaustive.
我无法覆盖所有内容
There's no way I can cover everything
针对特定主题
for a particular topic.
好消息是我们有时间
The good news is we have time.
我的目标  至少在第一年
My goal, at least in the first year
Huberman Lab播客
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
是给你一个基础
is to give you a basis,
这些不同主题的基础
a foundation in these different topics
神经可塑性  注意力  睡眠  激素等
of neuro-plasticity, focus, sleep, hormones et cetera.
当然  也要一路提供工具
And of course, to provide tools along the way.
我们将邀请嘉宾
We are going to host guests,
我实际上已经开始录制
I've actually started recording
已经有一些嘉宾在录制中
with some of these guests already.
甚至那些内容将包括
And even those episodes will include
我们称之为底漆的一些东西
a little what we call primer.
一点描述
A little description of
给定主题的基础
the basics of a given topic
这样你就可以从这些主题中获取更多信息
so that you can get more information from those topics.
我的目标确实是在这些主题上教你
My goal really is to educate you in these topics,
为你提供这些主题的基础
give you a foundation in these topics
并允许你开始探索它们
and allow you to start exploring them
在这集中  我们未来的嘉宾
here in the episodes with our future guests,
以及其他播客和书籍中
but also in other podcasts and books
和其他信息来源
and other sources of information.
所以对于你们当中那些说
So for those of you that are saying,
“信息太多了”
"It's too much information."
我只是鼓励你提醒自己
I just encourage you to remind yourself that
你有一个暂停按钮  可以返回它
you have a pause button you can return to it.
一切都带有时间戳
Everything's timestamped.
对于那些感觉到的人
For those of you that feel,
没有足够的信息  我没有涵盖足够的信息
it's not enough information I'm not covering enough.
只知道这仅仅是个开始
Just know that this is just the beginning.
我们打算很长时间都会做这个播客
We didn't intend to do this for a very long time
随着时间的流逝  我们将变得更加彻底
and we will be thorough over time.
非常感谢你的耐心配合
So thanks for your patience
并请耐心等待
and please be patient with yourselves.
不需要一口气
There's no reason why you have to digest
消化所有信息
all the information in one swoop.
另一件事是  我都被告知
The other thing is that I've been told both that
我说话太快  说话太慢
I speak too fast and speak too slow.
因此  有一个很好的解决方案
So there's a wonderful solution to this.
如果我说得太快或太慢
If I speak too fast or too slow
你可以在YouTube中调整速度
you can adjust the speed in YouTube.
如果你以其他格式收听
If you're listening in a different format,
我认为你也可以调整播放速度
I think you also can adjust the speed of playback.
所以那是
So that's something that
在教室里不可能实现的功能
wouldn't be possible in the classroom,
你会觉得很有用
but you may find useful.
最后一点
And then last but not least,
我想再次指出人们这个NSDR
I want to point people again to this NSDR,
非睡眠深度休息协议
non-sleep deep rest protocol,
Madefor的开发者
that the folks over at Madefor
提供了免费资源 并投入使用
have put out as a free resource.
正如你们许多人指出的那样
It does, as many of you pointed out,
与类似的东西
bear resemblance to things like
瑜伽nidra和其他形式的冥想相似
yoga nidra and other forms of meditation.
但是我们要做的是剥离
But what we've done is we've stripped out
意图或与之有关的任何形式的言语
intentions or any kind of the verbiage related to
有些人可能会认为
what some people might perceive as
与瑜伽社区有关或
kind of related to the yoga community or
特定于一种新的年龄型技术
specific to kind of new age-y type techniques.
不是因为我们不喜欢瑜伽nidra
Not because we don't like yoga nidra.
实际上  我几乎每天都做瑜伽nidra
In fact, I've done yoga nidra daily for almost the last
天哪  我一生八年
goodness, eight years of my life.
我爱瑜伽nidra
I love yoga nidra,
但是有时候语言很复杂
but sometimes the complicated language
可以成为分隔符  并可以劝阻人们
can be a separator and can discourage people
采取这些非常有用的协议
from taking on these protocols that are extremely useful.
因此  NSDR是意识通用的
So NSDR is intentionally generic.
它旨在使你进入
It's designed to bring you into a state of
通过结合深层放松
deep relaxation through a combination of
呼吸和身体扫描
breathing and body scan.
Madefor也有油管的脚本
There's the you too script over at Madefor
在评论区中有链接
which is linked in the caption.
许多人发现他们更喜欢
And many people find that they prefer that
像瑜伽nidra这样的脚本
to scripts like yoga nidra.
是有意图的脚本
Scripts where they're doing intentions
听众们听到很多
and they're hearing a lot of
不寻常的语言
kind of unusual language around the process.
这只是非常基本的
This is just very basic and
希望你会喜欢
I hope you'll enjoy it.
如果你更喜欢典型的瑜伽nidra脚本
And if you prefer the more typical yoga nidra scripts
那你喜欢就好
then go with those.
有很多可用的
There are many of them available
在网上和其他地方都能找到
on the internet and elsewhere.
最后是  我想指出
And last but not least I want to point out that,
现在我们所有的剧集都带有字幕
all our episodes now are subtitled
既有英文也有西班牙文
both in English and in Spanish.
所以对于那些喜欢的人
So for those of you that prefer
以西班牙语消化这些信息
to digest this information in Spanish,
现在可以在字幕中使用了
that's now available to you in the subtitles.
今天我们要谈的是
Today we're going to talk about
性科学
The Science of Sex.
尤其是性别分化
In particular, sexual differentiation.
这是一个复杂的话题  因为
Now that's a complicated topic because
性既是形容词  名词又是动词
sex is both a adjective, a noun and a verb,
取决于上下文
depending on the context.
今天我们要谈的是
Today we're going to talk about
荷尔蒙效应
the hormonal effects
和神经作用
and the neural effects
在成长过程中发生的特定事件
of particular events that happen during development
以及这些如何引导青少年和成人的行为
and how those guide adolescent and adult behavior,
包括性偏爱
including sexual preference.
这是一个引人入胜的领域
It's an area that's fascinating and for which,
实际上有非常扎实的教科书调查结果
there are actually very solid textbook findings.
所以教科书的发现意味着
So textbook findings means,
有很多研究
that there are many studies
几十年来一直在聚合
that have been aggregated over decades.
这就是我们现在所知道的
That point to what we now know to be
绝对真理
absolute truths in terms of
激素如何影响大脑发育
how hormones affect brain development,
大脑如何影响荷尔蒙发育
how the brain impacts hormonal development
以及它们如何相互作用以控制行为
and how those interact to control behavior for instance.
我们还将讨论生殖
We are also going to talk about reproduction,
动词性
the verb sex.
当然  对动词性
And of course, sex the verb,
也可以独立于繁殖而进行
can also be carried out independent of reproduction.
并非总是如此
It's not always,
特别是在人类中
in particular in humans,
不只是为了产生后代
just to produce offspring.
因此  下集将对此进行介绍
So that's going to be covered in the next episode,
但是你绝对需要了解
but you absolutely need to understand
本集中的信息
the information in this episode,
为了使信息有意义
in order to make sense of the information
在下一集
in the next episode.
因此  今天我们将探索激素
So, today we're going to explore hormones.
它们是什么  它们如何工作
What they are, how they work,
导致男性化或女性化的原因
what leads to masculinization or feminization
大脑和身体？
of the brain and body?
我将抛出一个非常有趣的事实
I'll just throw out one really interesting fact
也许你们大多数人没有意识到
that perhaps most of you didn't realize that
激素对身体有直接影响
hormones have direct effects on the body.
大多数人都知道  因为
Most people know that because there are
体内的激素差异和性别差异
hormone differences and sex differences in bodies
在生殖器和体毛方面
in terms of genitalia and body hair,
体毛分布等等
distribution of body hair et cetera.
但是激素也直接对大脑产生影响
But there are also effects of hormones on the brain directly
信不信由你
and believe it or not there're also effects
在脊髓上也有影响
on the spinal cord.
在脊髓内的神经元和结构上
On the neurons and structures within the spinal cord
以非常直接的方式产生影响
that impact in a very direct way,
什么样的行为是可能的
what sorts of behaviors are possible.
所以这是一个迷人的地方
So it's a fascinating area,
你可能会注意到
you might notice I'm going to go
我在这个话题上会讲的慢一点
a little bit more slowly through this topic
比我平时的速度要慢
than I normally do.
我要特别小心我的语言
I want to be extremely careful with my language.
其中一些主题
Some of these topics,
你们中有些人可能认为非常敏感  对吧？
some of you may be thinking are extremely sensitive, right?
而且当然
And of course,
关于性与生殖的任何讨论
any discussion about sex and reproduction
是一个敏感的话题
is a sensitive one.
但是今天我们只是在谈论生物学
But today we're just talking about the biology.
我们没有陷入文化限制
We're not getting into the cultural constraints
或文化对话
or the cultural dialogue.
我们今天要做的是真正做到
What we're trying to do today is really get to
生物学  生理学  内分泌学
the biology, the physiology, the endocrinology
和行为
and the behavior.
因此  让我们从谈论
So let's start by talking about
什么是激素开始
what hormones are just to remind you
以及它们的作用
and what they do.
根据定义  激素
Hormones by definition,
是一种物质  一种化学物质
are a substance, a chemical that's
在身体的一个区域释放
released in one area of the body.
通常从我们称为腺体的东西
Typically from something we call a gland,
尽管它们也可以从神经元中释放出来
although they can also be released from neurons.
但它们经常从腺体中释放出来
But they're released often from glands,
传输并对该腺有影响
that travel and have effects both on that gland
而且还可以作用于人体的其他器官和组织
but also on other organs and tissues in the body.
那可以区分荷尔蒙
And that differentiates hormones
来自神经递质
from things like neurotransmitters,
往往会在器官本身上采取更多行动
which tend to act more locally.
这很重要
So that's important.
激素是一种分泌的物质
A hormone is a substance secreted
在身体的一个位置传输
at one location in the body, travels,
并影响身体其他部位的事物
and has impact on things elsewhere in the body.
产生激素的组织的例子是
Examples of tissues that produce hormones would be
甲状腺  睾丸  卵巢等
the thyroid, the testes, the ovaries et cetera.
然后当然是大脑的某些区域
And then of course there are areas of the brain
如下丘脑和垂体
like the hypothalamus and the pituitary,
彼此密切相关
which are closely related to one another
并释放引起释放的激素
and release hormones that cause the release
体内的其他激素
of yet other hormones out in the body.
因此  我们将介绍所有这些内容
So we're going to cover all this.
如果你对内分泌学一无所知
If you don't know anything about endocrinology,
你仍然能够
you're still going to be able to
了解今天的讨论
understand today's discussion.
我们将从讨论开始
And we're going to start with a discussion about,
荷尔蒙到底在做什么
what hormones actually do,
创造我们称之为的东西
to create this thing that we call
男性化或女性化
masculinization or feminization.
因此  让我们从开发开始
So let's start with development.
精子遇卵
Sperm meets egg.
在此之前发生的一切
Everything that happens before that
是下一集的主题
is a topic of the next episode.
但是  精子遇卵
But, sperm meets egg.
这是哺乳动物的繁殖
This is mammalian reproduction.
那个卵子开始复制
And that egg starts to duplicate,
它开始变得更多
it starts to make more of itself.
它产生更多的细胞
It makes more cells.
最终这些细胞中的一些变成了皮肤
And eventually some of those cells become skin.
这些细胞中有一些变成了大脑
Some of those cells become brain.
这些细胞中有些会变成肌肉
Some of those cells become muscle.
这些细胞中有些变成手指
Some of those cells become fingers.
构成大脑和身体计划的所有东西
All the stuff that makes up the brain and body plan.
此外  还有激素
In addition, there are hormones
都来自母亲
that come both from the mother
和成长中的婴儿
and from the developing baby,
发育中的胎儿
the developing fetus.
那影响大脑是否会
That impact. whether or not the brain will be
他们称之为有组织的男性化或有组织的女性化
what they call organized masculine or organized feminine.
正如我所说的
And as I say this,
我要你尝试抛弃
I want you to try and discard
文化内涵
with the cultural connotations
或你的心理含义
or your psychological connotations,
什么是男性化和女性化
of what masculinization and feminization are.
因为我们只关注生物学
Because we're only centering on the biology.
因此  通常情况下  人们有两个X染色体
So typically, people have either two X chromosomes,
以及传统语言中
and the traditional language around that
那个人称之为女性
is that person is female, right?
或者X染色体和Y染色体
Or an X chromosome and a Y chromosome
那个人传统定义为男性
and that person will become male.
并非总是如此
Now it's not always the case.
在某些情况下是XXY
There are cases where it's XXY,
那里有两个X染色体和一个Y染色体
where there two X chromosomes plus a Y chromosome.
在某些情况下  它是XYY
There are also cases where it's XYY.
有两个Y染色体
Where they're two Y chromosomes.
这些具有重要的生物学意义
and these have important biological
和心理影响
and psychological impacts.
所以我们需要建立的第一件事是
So the first thing we need to establish is that
有一种叫做染色体性的东西
there is something called chromosomal sex.
不管它们是两个X染色体
Whether or not they're two X chromosomes,
或X和Y染色体
or an X and Y chromosome,
这就是我们所说的染色体性
is what we call chromosomal sex.
但是  分离性别的下一阶段
But the next stage of separating out the sexes,
这就是我们所说的生殖腺性别
is what we call gonadal sex.
通常  并非总是如此  但通常
Typically not always, but typically
如果有人的性腺有睾丸
if somebody has testes for their gonads,
我们认为他们是男性
we think of them as male.
如果有人有卵巢  我们会将其视为女性
And if somebody has ovaries, we think of them as female.
尽管也不总是这样
Although that's not always the case either.
但是让我们来探索
But let's just explore
从染色体性向生殖腺性别的过渡
the transition from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex,
因为这是一个令人着迷的
because it's a fascinating one
我们所有人都以某种形式经历过
that we all went through in some form or another.
所以我们通常认为的XY
So this XY that we typically think of as
促进胎儿的男性化
promoting masculinization of the fetus.
我们说  因为在Y染色体上有基因
We say that because on the Y chromosome there are genes
这些基因具有特定的功能  可以抑制
and those genes have particular functions that suppress
女性生殖器官
female reproductive organs.
所以在Y染色体上有一个基因
So on the Y chromosome there's a gene,
生物编码叫做
which encodes for something called
所谓的苗勒抑制激素
Mullerian Inhibiting Hormone.
所以实际上有一种激素
So there's actually a hormone
由Y染色体编码
that's programmed by the Y chromosome
阻止了副中肾管的形成
that inhibits the formation of Mullerian Ducts,
这是女性的生殖器的重要组成部分
which are an important part of the female reproductive apparatus.
这很关键  因为
That's critical because,
我们已经看到了
already we're seeing the transition between
Y染色体和性腺之间的演变
chromosome Y chromosome and gonad.
Y染色体上的其他基因
And other genes on the Y chromosome
促进睾丸的形成
promote the formation of testes.
所以有些基因像SRY基因
So there are genes like the SRY gene
和其他促进睾丸形成的基因
and other genes that promote the formation of testes,
同时它们也抑制了副中肾管
while they also inhibit the formation
的形成
of the Mullerian Ducts.
所以从染色体性向生殖腺性别的过渡
So the transition from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex
是一个非常重要的区别
is a very important distinction.
有点像叉路
It's kind of a fork in the road
在成长的早期就发生了
that happens very early in development
当胎儿仍在胚胎中
while fetuses are still in the embryo.
有趣的是
Now what's interesting as well,
就是因为有一条Y染色体
is that just because there's a Y chromosome
可以抑制副中肾管的形成
that can suppress Mullerian Duct formation
而且Y染色体上还有其他基因
and there are other genes on the Y chromosome that
促进睾丸的发育
promote testes development.
胎盘本身是内分泌器官
The placenta itself is an endocrine organ.
我想大多数人都不知道
I think most people don't know this
但是胎盘也是内分泌器官
but the placenta is an endocrine organ as well.
母亲  当然是在怀着胎儿
The mother, which of course is carrying the fetus
有可以产生睾丸激素的肾上腺
has an adrenal gland which can produce testosterone.
举例来说
There are instances for example,
母亲患有肿瘤的地方
where a mother has either a tumor
或其他原因
or for some other reason is
分泌大量睾丸激素
secreting large levels of testosterone
而携带的胎儿是XX
while carrying a fetus that is XX.
这导致了
And that leads to what
我们称之为男性化
we would call masculinization
在胎儿的某些方面
of certain aspects of the fetus.
通常情况下  阴蒂会增大
Typically, that will be enlarged clitoris.
还有一些例子
There also some examples
在身体上产生的其他表型
of other phenotypes on the body that are created
即使是纯粹的XX染色体婴儿
even though it's a purely XX chromosomal baby.
所以我们必须区分
So we have to distinguish between
染色体性  生殖腺性别
chromosomal sex, gonadal sex.
然后就是所谓的荷尔蒙性爱
And then there's what we call hormonal sex.
就是类固醇激素的作用
Which is the effects of the steroid hormones,
雌激素和睾丸激素及其衍生物
estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives,
关于我们所谓的形态性
on what we call morphological sex
或婴儿和人的形状
or the shape of the baby and the human
生殖器和下巴
and the genitalia and the jaw
以及所有其他这些东西
and all these other things.
因此  这实际上非常复杂
And so it actually is quite complicated.
所以  距离
So you know, it's a long distance from
性别认同的染色体
chromosomes to gender identity
性别认同有很多
and gender identity has a lot of
社会影响力和角色
social influences and roles.
这是一个非常活跃的领域
This is an area that right now is very dynamic
在你所知道的讨论中
and in the discussion out there as you know.
但是只是从染色体性中来讨论
But just getting from chromosomal sex
所谓的生殖腺性别
to what we would call gonadal sex
荷尔蒙性别和形态性别
and hormonal sex and morphological sex,
涉及许多步骤
involves a number of steps.
因此  今天我们将讨论这些步骤
So today we're going to talk about those steps.
还有一些令人着迷的事情
And there's some fascinating things that
确实与工具有关
do indeed relate to tools.
确实有关于
Do indeed relate
一些重要的行为选择
to some important behavioral choices.
关于怀孕期间应避免的重要事情
Important choices about things to avoid while pregnant.
对于你们中那些没有怀孕的人
And for those of you that are not pregnant,
如果要考虑要避免的事情
things to avoid if you're thinking about
如果最终想要有孩子
eventually having children.
那不是在推动发育
And that is not to drive development
在一个方向或另一个方向上
in one direction or another,
但是有些例子
but there are examples where
我们的环境中有些有害的东西
there are some deleterious things in our environment
实际上可能会产生负面影响
that can actually negatively impact
我们所谓的性发育
what we call sexual development overall,
不论染色体背景如何
regardless of chromosomal background.
那么  让我们开始吧
So let's get started with that.
让我们再谈一些荷尔蒙的作用
Let's talk a little bit more about what hormones do.
激素通常具有两类作用
Hormones generally have two categories of effects.
它们可以非常快  也可以非常慢
They can either be very fast or they can be very slow.
有一些激素  例如皮质醇和肾上腺素
There are hormones like cortisol and adrenaline,
发挥作用得非常快
which act very fast.
肾上腺素会增加你的心率
Adrenaline can increase your heart rate
分泌到体内时非常快
very fast when secreted into the body.
皮质醇可能会慢一点
Cortisol can be a little bit slower,
但它也会产生一些非常快速的效果
but it also can have some very fast effects.
然后有的激素
And then there are hormones like.
像睾丸激素和雌激素一样
Like testosterone and estrogen,
我们将其称为性类固醇激素
which we refer to as the sex steroid hormones.
性类固醇激素可以有
The sex steroid hormones can have
通过发送信号产生快速效果
quick effects through signaling.
意味着它们可以附着在细胞上
Meaning they can attach to cells
并使这些细胞做不同的事情
and make those cells do different things.
它们实际上可以对大脑产生非常快速的影响
They can have a actually quite quick effects on the brain.
很多人不知道这一点
A lot of people don't know this,
但有一些非常快速的效果
but there are some very fast effects of
雌激素和睾丸激素以及长期作用
estrogen and testosterone as well as long-term effects.
这些分子  对于你们中那些感兴趣的人
These molecules, for those of you that are interested,
是所谓的亲脂性的
are what it called lipophilic.
只是意味着他们喜欢脂肪类的东西
Which just means that they like fatty stuff,
它们实际上可以穿过脂肪膜
they can actually pass through fatty membranes.
而且由于细胞的外部
And because the outside of cells,
以及所谓的核被膜
as well as the what's called the nuclear envelope.
所有的DNA内容物都被包裹在里面
Where all the DNA contents and stuff are stuffed inside,
由脂质  脂肪制成
are made of lipid, of fat.
这些类固醇激素实际上可以进入细胞
These steroid hormones can actually travel into cells
然后进入DNA
and then get into the DNA.
基本上与细胞的DNA相互作用
Basically interact with the DNA of cells
然后来控制基因表达
in order to control gene expression.
所以他们可以改变
So they can change
细胞之后会变成的样子
the sorts of things that cells will become
他们可以改变细胞功能
and they can change the way that cells function
是长期的作用
in a long-term way.
实际上就是这样
And that's actually how
这些基因如SRY的存在
the presence of these genes like SRY
和苗勒氏管激素
and Mullerian inhibiting hormone,
导致它们减少或消除
lead to reductions or elimination I should say,
副中肾管之类的东西
of things like the Mullerian Ducts
并促进男性体内所谓的
and promote instead what's called in males
伍尔夫管
the Wolffian Ducts.
或促进睾丸而不是卵巢的发育
Or promote the development of testes rather than ovaries.
所以你只需要知道
So all you need to know is that
激素具有短期和长期作用
hormones have short-term and long-term effects.
长期的影响实际上是
And the long-term effects are actually
与它们对基因的影响有关
related to their effects on genes
以及这些基因是如何表达或被抑制的
and how those genes are expressed or repressed,
或者为了防止它们
in order to prevent them from having
制成特殊蛋白质
particular proteins made.
这些激素
So these hormones,
这些类固醇激素极为强大
these steroid hormones are exceedingly powerful.
如果我们要讨论
And if we're going to have a discussion about
男性化或女性化等等
masculinization or feminization et cetera,
你还需要考虑反面的
you also need to think about the counterpart.
不仅要男性化
It's not just about masculinizing the body
或者女性化身体和大脑
or feminizing the body and brain,
在许多情况下  这还涉及大脑的去男性化
it's also about demasculinize the brain in many cases,
作为正常的生物学功能
as a normal biological function
通常是XX染色体的女性  都会去男性化
of typically of XX females.
还有去女性化
And de feminization,
抑制某些相关通路
the suppression of certain pathways that are related
使身体和大脑女性化
to feminization of the body and brain.
但是这个故事确实有一些令人着迷的转折
But there are some really fascinating twists in this story.
所以我向你介绍了很多生物学知识  但是
So I've just thrown a lot of biology at you, but
这就是一切开始变得令人惊讶的地方
this is where it all starts to get incredibly surprising.
你会认为这很简单直接  对吧？
You would think that it's straightforward, right?
你有一条Y染色体
You have a Y chromosome
你压制女性生殖通路
you suppress the female reproductive pathway
像副中肾管
like the Mullerian Ducts.
你促进睾丸的发育
You promote the development of testes
然后睾丸制造睾丸激素
and then testes make testosterone.
然后组织大脑倾向男性
And then it organizes the brain male
它想做“男性喜欢”的事情
and it wants to do male like things.
然后在女性体内  雌激素
And then in females you get estrogen
它想做“女性喜欢”的事情
and it wants to do female like things.
这些性别喜好都要加引号
And air quotes here for all of this.
事实证明  这根本不是它的工作原理
It turns out that isn't how it works at all.
这是有趣的地方
Here's where it's interesting.
我们必须了解
We have to understand
这些激素
that there are effects of these hormones,
睾丸激素和雌激素
testosterone and estrogen.
影响所谓的主要性特征
on what are called primary sexual characteristics.
是天生的
Which are the ones that you're born with.
而次要性特征
Secondary sexual characteristics,
就是青春期出现的那些
which are the ones that show up in puberty.
这些发生在大脑中
And these are happening in the brain
还有身体和脊髓中
and body and spinal cord.
因此  我将为你解开所有这些问题
And so I'm going to disentangle all this for you
通过给你一些例子
by giving you some examples.
首先  让我们谈谈
First, let's talk about the development of
主要的性特征 第一性征
primary sexual characteristics.
出生时出现的那些
The ones that show up at birth.
更具戏剧性的例子之一
And one of the more dramatic examples of this
来自睾丸激素的作用
comes from the role of testosterone
在创造外部生殖器
in creating the external genitalia.
你可能会认为这很简单
Now you might think it's just straight forward.
如果有睾丸  那是因为有Y染色体
If there's a testes, 'cause there's a Y chromosome.
你知道  你有一个基因编码
You know, you've got a gene that codes for
睾丸的发育  你会得到睾丸激素
the development of testes, you get testosterone
阴茎长大
and the penis grows
婴儿天生有阴茎
and the baby is born with a penis.
你知道的  发生的第一件事
You know, one of the first things that happens
婴儿出来的时候
when the baby comes out
他们会看生殖器
is they look at the genitalia,
他们尝试评估
and they try and make an assessment on whether or not
这是一个“男孩”还是一个“女孩”  对不对？
it's a quote boy or it's a quote girl, right?
这么做已经很长时间了
That's been done for a very very long time
在整个人类历史中一直这样
throughout human history.
事实证明  这不是由睾丸激素引起的
It turns out that it's not testosterone that's responsible
阴茎的发育
for the development of the penis
有X染色体和Y染色体的婴儿中
in a baby that has an X chromosome and a Y chromosome.
而是一种不同的雄激素
It's a different androgen.
雄激素只是激素的一类
Androgen is just a category of hormones
包括睾丸激素
that includes testosterone,
但是睾丸激素会在胎儿体内转化
but testosterone is converted in the fetus
称为二氢睾丸激素
to something called dihydrotestosterone.
这是通过
And that's accomplished through
一种称为5-α-还原酶完成的
an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase.
现在二氢睾丸激素有重要作用
Now dihydrotestosterone has important effects
长大以后也一样
later in life too.
我们将讨论这些
We will talk about those.
实际上  如果你只想知道
In fact, if you just want to know,
二氢睾丸激素就是我们所说的
dihydrotestosterone is what we would call
男性中占主导地位的雄激素
the dominant androgen in males.
这是男性有侵略性的原因
It's responsible for aggression.
它负责大量的肌肉力量
It's responsible for a lot of muscular strength.
它与胡须生长和男性型秃发有关
It's involved in beard growth and male pattern baldness.
我们将讨论所有这些
We're going to talk about all of that.
但是二氢睾丸激素有强大的作用
But dihydrotestosterone has powerful effects
确定了生殖器
in determining the genitalia,
婴儿仍在胚胎中就确定了
while the baby is still in the embryo.
所以
So this ends.
有睾丸激素产生
There's testosterone that's made.
那睾丸激素被转化了
And that testosterone gets converted
通过这种酶5-α-还原酶
by this enzyme 5-alpha-reductase
在一个称为结节的小结构中
in a little structure called the tubercle.
那块结节最终会变成阴茎
That tubercle will eventually become the penis.
所以你说：“好吧  直截了当”
So you say, "Okay, straight forward."
该睾丸激素被转化为二氢睾丸激素
This testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone.
然后如果有二氢睾丸激素
And then if there's dihydrotestosterone
它控制了阴茎的生长
it controls penis growth.
的确是这样
And indeed that's the case.
这是主要的性特征  第一性征
So that's a primary sexual characteristic.
该婴儿随后将长大  并在青春期以后
That baby will then grow up and later during puberty
会有一个分子释放出来
there will be the release of a molecule.
我上一集谈到了  称为Kisspeptin
I talked about this last episode called Kisspeptin.
KISSPEPTIN 亲吻素
K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N kisspeptin,
这会导致一些其他激素的释放
which will cause the release of some other hormones
天然释放激素  促黄体激素
Connatural releasing hormone, Luteinizing hormone
会刺激睾丸产生睾丸激素
will stimulate the testes to make testosterone.
所以在青春期  睾丸激素会导致进一步
So in puberty, testosterone leads to further
阴茎的增长和发育
growth and development of the penis,
以及阴毛的积累或生长
as well as the accumulation of or growth of pubic hair,
声音的加深
a deepening of the voice,
所有次要的性特征  第二性征  好吗？
all the secondary sexual characteristics, okay?
所以二氢睾丸激素创造了我们所谓的
So dihydrotestosterone creates what we would call
典型的男性表型
the typical masculine phenotype for
主要的性特征和产生
primary sexual characteristics and produces.
不好意思 是睾丸激素  产生
Testosterone excuse me, produces
青春期的第二性征
secondary sexual characteristics during puberty.
有一个非常有趣的现象
There's a very interesting phenomenon
在1970年代发表在《科学杂志》上
that was published in The Journal of Science in the 1970s,
而这方面  现在有大量的科学数据
for which now there's a wealth of scientific data.
这与基因突变有关
And this relates to a genetic mutation,
5-α-还原酶  也就是是转化
where 5-alpha-reductase the enzyme that converts
睾丸激素到二氢睾丸激素的酶  会消失
testosterone to dihydrotestosterone doesn't exist.
它以某种方式突变为不存在的基因组
It's mutated in a way into a genome that it doesn't exist.
这实际上是最先确定的
And this actually was first identified
在多米尼加共和国
in the Dominican Republic.
它已经出现在其他地方
It has shown up elsewhere.
它很少见  但在显示出来的地方这个现象非常稳定
It's quite rare, but where it shows up it's robust.
发生的事情是婴儿出生
What happens is baby is born.
通常在婴儿出生时
Typically when a baby is born
他们不测量染色体
they don't measure chromosomes.
他们不看染色体性别XX或XY
They don't look at chromosomal sex XX or XY.
如今通常不这样做
That's not typically done nowadays.
婴儿出生
Baby is born.
如果你要看那个婴儿
If you were to look at that baby,
它看起来像女性
it would look female.
几乎没有外阴茎或没有外阴茎
There would be very little or no external penis.
因此人们会说：“这是一个女孩”
And so people would say, "It's a girl."
他们可能会  你知道
And they might, you know,
庆祝这是一个女孩
have the celebration it's a girl.
我想现在他们称他们为“宝宝性别派对”
And I guess now they call them "Gender Reveal Parties"
或类似的东西
or something like that.
我对此一无所知  但无论如何
I don't know about this, but anyway.
他们会透露
They would reveal.
婴儿会露出其外生殖器
The baby would reveal its external genitalia
只需在出生时就在那里裸体即可
simply by being there and being naked when it's born.
与心理性别无关
It has nothing to do with gender,
它与生殖器和生理性别有关
it has to do with genitalia and sex.
那孩子出生了
That baby would be born.
观察到的是
And what was observed is that,
时不时的
from time to time,
那个小时候长大的作为女孩的婴儿
that baby after being raised as a girl,
作为一个女孩完全快乐
perfectly happy as a girl
大约11岁  12岁或13岁
would around the age of 11 or 12 or 13,
会突然开始萌生长出阴茎
would suddenly start to sprout a penis.
其实有个名字
There's actually a name for this,
它叫做Guevedoces
it's called Guevedoces.
翻译过来  大概就是 12岁的阴茎
Which the translation is more or less, penis at 12.
听起来可能很奇怪
And as strange as this might sound,
如果你了解潜在的突变  这是有道理的
it makes sense if you understand the underlying mutation.
这些孩子  这些Guevedoces  到底发生了什么？
What happens in these children, these Guevedoces,
孩子出生了
is that the child is born.
她的睾丸没有往下长
It has testes which are not descended,
这样在体内
so up in the body.
她们并没有在早期制造大量的睾丸激素
They're not making a lot of testosterone early on.
她们无法
They weren't able to
将睾丸激素转化为二氢睾丸激素
convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone
因为她们缺乏这种酶5-α-还原酶
because they lack this enzyme 5-alpha-reductase.
作为结果
As a consequence,
主要的性特征  第一性征
the primary sexual characteristic
男性生殖器  阴茎
of external male genitalia, penis,
没有生长
doesn't develop.
然后发生的是
And then what happens is
婴儿从小就长大
the baby grows up as a young child essentially
被当作​​一个女孩
is treated as a girl.
通常  他们报告说当女孩子也很舒服
Generally they report being pretty comfortable as girls,
尽管并非总是如此
although not always.
然后睾丸激素开始被分泌
And then testosterone starts getting secreted
来自睾丸的原因是大脑中的亲吻肽
from the testes 'cause kisspeptin in the brain
促性腺激素和促黄体生成素的信号
signals through gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone
一直到睾丸
and travels down to the testes,
睾丸开始搅动睾丸激素
the testes start churning out testosterone
阴茎有二次生长
and there's a secondary growth of the penis.
突然之间出现了阴茎
And all of a sudden there's a penis.
这导致了一些非常复杂的情况
And this leads to some very complicated situations
在家庭和文化上造成了冲击
in families and culturally.
实际上  无论是否
And actually the outcomes in terms of whether or not
这些孩子决定自认是男性还是女性
these children decide to self identify as males or females
以及人们如何对待他们
and how people treat them
实际上变化很大
actually varies quite a lot.
实际上有一种
There's actually been kind of an
采用第三种性别
adopting of a third category of sex and gender
在这些Guevedoces中
in these Guevedoces for
为了给他们提供机会
in order to just offer them the opportunity to
探索不仅是一种典型的
explore not just what would be a typical kind of
女孩或女人或男孩或男人的表型
girl or woman or boy or man phenotype,
但是介于两者之间
but something in between.
虽然有些人称其为双性
Something that some people call intersex although
双性和假性雌雄同体
intersex and pseudo hermaphroditism
实际上完全是一回事
is actually a separate thing altogether.
所以很有趣  这里的重点
So it's fascinating and the point here
是二氢睾丸激素而不是睾丸激素
is that dihydrotestosterone not testosterone
负责阴茎的这种主要生长
is responsible for this primary growth of the penis.
后来那个睾丸激素参与了
And that testosterone later is involved in
次要性特征
the secondary sexual characteristics
声音加深等等
deepening in the voice, et cetera.
现在这是信息
Now this is where the information
变得更加有趣
gets even more interesting
基本上适用于所有人
and applies to essentially everybody.
你可能认为
You might think
那个睾丸激素  因为它使身体男性化
that testosterone because it masculinizes the body
以次要的性特征  第二性征方式
in the secondary sexual characteristic way.
因为二氢睾丸激素是另一种雄激素
And because dihydrotestosterone another androgen,
男性化了主要的性特征  第一性征
masculinizes the primary sexual characteristics.
早期阴茎的生长
The growth of the penis early on,
睾丸激素肯定会使大脑男性化
that testosterone must masculinize the brain.
实际上
And there are in fact aspects of
大脑和身体的男性化
masculinization of the brain and body,
与生殖器无关
that are independent of genitalia.
现在对某些人来说很明显
Now it might be obvious to some of you,
但是有些人可能没有意识到
but some people probably don't realize that.
是的  的确  大脑具有睾丸激素的受体
Yes indeed the brain has receptors for testosterone.
它还具有雌激素受体
It also has receptors for estrogen.
但有趣的是
But the fascinating thing is that
如果你看一下
if you look at the brains of
有Y染色体且有睾丸的人
people that have Y chromosomes and that have testes
然后产生睾丸激素
and that make testosterone,
你看着人的大脑
and you look at the brains of people
没有Y染色体或睾丸的
that don't have Y chromosomes or testes
因此  一般来说  睾丸激素的含量要少得多
and therefore make far less testosterone in general,
你意识到的是大脑中的细胞
what you realize is that the cells in the brain
在我所说的男性和女性之间不同的
that differ between what I'll call males and females,
也就是XY和XX之间
but between XY, and XX
有睾丸激素的受体
have receptors for testosterone,
但是大脑的男性化
but the masculinization of the brain
不能由睾丸激素完成
is not accomplished by testosterone.
我想重复一遍
I want to repeat this.
大脑的男性化
The masculinization of the brain
不能由睾丸激素完成
is not accomplished by testosterone.
它是由雌激素完成的
It is accomplished by estrogen.
睾丸激素可以转化为雌激素
Testosterone can be converted into estrogen
被称为芳香酶的酶
by an enzyme called aromatase.
要理解这一点至关重要
This is vitally important to understand.
睾丸激素可以转化为雌激素
Testosterone can be converted into estrogen
被称为芳香化酶的东西
by something called aromatase.
我将举一个例子说明发生这种情况的地方
I'll give an example of where this happens
以后的生活
later in life,
只是说明原理
to just illustrate the principle
并将其真正嵌入你的脑海
and really embed it in your mind.
在男孩的青春期  XY染色体的男孩
During puberty in boys, XY chromosome individuals.
有一种情况并不少见
It's not uncommon for there to be
就是短暂或有时长久的乳房芽发育
transient or sometimes long lasting breast bud development.
青春期睾丸激素升高
Testosterone goes up during puberty,
由于我们之前讨论的原因
for the reasons we talked about before.
一些睾丸激素转化为雌激素
And some of that testosterone gets converted into estrogen
被称为芳香酶的酶
by an enzyme called aromatase.
芳香酶是由体内几种来源产生的
Aromatase is made by several sources in the body.
主要来源之一是体内脂肪
One of the main sources is body fat.
因此  它可以产生大量的芳香化酶
So it can make a lot of aromatase.
有时候你甚至会看到
Sometimes you'll even see
青春期男性的乳房发育相当剧烈
fairly dramatic breast development in males during puberty.
有时是暂时的  有时不是
Sometimes it's transient, sometimes it's not.
你看到这个的另一个地方
The other place where you see this
在运动员和健美运动员中
is in athletes and bodybuilders
需要大量的合成代谢类固醇
that take a lot of anabolic steroids.
那需要高水平的雄激素
That take high levels of androgens.
所以他们会服用睾丸激素
So they'll be taking testosterone
服用的超过了生理剂量
at super physiological doses.
有时并非总是如此
Sometimes not always.
他们会将一些睾丸激素转化为雌激素
They will convert some of that testosterone into estrogen
他们会得到所谓的男性乳房发育症
and they'll get what's called gynecomastia.
就是男性乳房组织的发育
Which is the development of male breast tissue.
有时他们会通过外科手术将其切除
Sometimes they'll get it cut out surgically.
其他时候他们会开始尝试
Other times they'll start trying to take
雌激素阻滞剂以试图抑制它
estrogen blockers in order to try and suppress it
否则他们会尝试催乳素阻滞剂
or they'll try and block prolactin.
我们将更详细地讨论这个主题
It's a topic that we're going to get into in more detail.
但是这里重要的是要了解
But what's important here is to understand that
睾丸激素可以通过芳香化酶转化为雌激素
testosterone can be converted to estrogen by aromatase.
芳香酶不仅仅是在体内脂肪中产生的
Aromatase is not just made in body fat.
大脑中有神经元产生芳香化酶
There are neurons in the brain that make aromatase
并将睾丸激素转化为雌激素
and convert testosterone into estrogen.
它是睾丸激素转化为雌激素
And it is testosterone converted into estrogen.
换句话说
In other words,
是雌激素让XY个体男性化
it's estrogen that masculinizes XY individual.
让他的大脑男性化
That masculinizes the brain.
这对各种事物都有深远的影响
And this has profound effects on all sorts of things.
关于行为  关于世界观等等
On behavior, on outlook in the world et cetera.
但我认为大多数人都没有意识到
But I think most people don't realize
那是来自睾丸激素的雌激素
that it's estrogen that comes from testosterone
男性化男性的大脑  XY的大脑
that masculinizes the male brain, the XY brain.
不是睾丸激素  也不是二氢睾丸激素
Not testosterone nor dihydrotestosterone.
因此  我只想提及一些工具
So I just want to mention some tools.
你可能会问自己
You might be asking yourself,
“怎么可能会有一些办法和工具呢
"How could tools possibly come up
在对话的这个阶段
at this stage of the conversation
我们明明是在谈论生理性的发育
where we're talking about sexual development
我们正在谈论
and we're talking about
人体组织的分化”
the differentiation of tissues in the body."
好吧  这对孩子
Well, this is true both for children
以及父母和成年人都适用
and parents and adults.
我想强调一点
I want to emphasize that
有些事情是环境的
there are things that are environmental
人们还会用一些东西
and there are things that people use
在他们的家中用的  有时实际上可能会影响
in their homes sometimes that actually can impact
激素水平  并可能影响
hormone levels and can impact
性发育的方式  相当深刻的影响
sexual development in fairly profound ways.
我想说的很清楚
And I want to be very clear,
这不是我从
this is not me pulling from
一些从未听说过的稀有杂志 里面找出来的
some rare journal have never heard of it.
这是从教科书中提取的
This is pulling from textbooks.
特别是如今  我很多信息都是从
In particular, today I'm guiding a lot of the conversation
“行为内分泌学”中提取
on work that on "Behavioral Endocrinology,"
是兰迪·尼尔森（Randy Nelson）和兰斯·克里格斯菲尔德（Lance Kriegsfeld）的书
is a book by Randy Nelson and Lance Kriegsfeld.
该领域的真正专家
True experts in the field.
我将谈论泰隆·海斯（Tyrone Hayes）的一些作品
I'm going to talk about some of the work from Tyrone Hayes
来自加州大学伯克利分校
from UC Berkeley
关于环境毒素及  环境的影响
about environmental toxins and their impacts on
对其中一些诸如睾丸激素和雌激素的影响
some of these things like testosterone and estrogen.
我将接触它们
I'm going to touch into them.
我将提供一些轶事证据
I'm going to give some anecdotal evidence
以研究为基础
that's grounded in studies,
我们将在标题中提供
which we will provide in the caption
或我将在这里引用
or that I'll reference here.
那些真的很有趣的东西之一
One of those that's actually really interesting
但有助于说明原理
but helps illustrate the principle
我们一直在谈论的是
that we've been talking about is.
几年前  有阵风很大
A few years ago, there was a lot of excitement
关于月见草油
about Evening Primrose Oil.
月见草油有很多产品
Evening Primrose Oil is in a lot of products
通常是关联着
that typically are associated
皮肤美容和皮肤健康的功效
with skin beauty and skin health.
所以我在这里概括
And so I'm generalizing here.
但通常是母亲或姐妹在使用它
But typically it was mothers or sisters that were using it.
实际上有一些例子开始出现
And there were actually examples starting to crop up
年轻男孩越来越
of young boys getting
被促进乳芽发育
accelerated breast bud development
从与使用月见草油的女性皮肤接触中被促进
from skin contact with women were using Evening Primrose Oil.
所以月见草油是
So Evening Primrose Oil is
化学上很像雌激素
chemically a lot like estrogen
而且它有很多雌激素化合物
and it has a lot of estrogenic compounds.
有很多这样的物质
There are a number of things out there like this.
因此  信不信由你  像松花粉
So believe it or not things like pine pollen
在结构上看起来非常像睾丸激素
look very much like testosterone structurally.
它们或多或少就是睾丸激素
They are more or less are testosterone.
它们在人体中的生物利用度还不清楚
Their bioavailability in humans isn't as clear.
月见草油有很多雌激素的组成结构
Evening Primrose Oil has a lot of estrogenic elements to it
只是从组成结构上来看
Just structurally how it's built.
因此  在某些情况下  男孩是
And so there were cases where boys were
可以理解
understandably you know,
被他们妈妈拥抱
being hugged by their mom
甚至喜欢洗澡和服用
or maybe even like showering and taking.
使用月见草油
you know using the Evening Primrose Oil solution.
这些东西实际上会改变雌激素的水平
Those things will actually change levels of estrogens
男孩和女孩身上都会这样
in boys and girls.
因此  这不仅是年轻男孩的问题
And so this wasn't just an issue for young boys.
对于年轻女孩来说  这也是一个问题
This is also an issue for young girls.
所以不是说月见草油不好
So it's not that Evening Primrose Oil is bad,
只是你们中的许多人可能听说过
it's just that many of you have probably heard
关于大豆异黄酮的危害
about the dangers of Soy Isoflavones
诸如此类的事情
and things like that.
大豆对雌激素水平的影响是
The impact of soy on estrogen levels is,
有一些体面的证据可以证明这一点
there are some decent evidence to support that.
但是  还有很多其他因素
However, there's a lot of other factors
那更严重
that are more severe.
其中之一就是月见草油
And one of those is this Evening Primrose Oil.
所以不管年龄
So regardless of age,
让我们这样说吧
let's just put it this way
因为人们可能想让自己的激素
because people might be wanting to drive their
有更多雌激素或更多的雄激素
hormones more estrogenic or more androgenic.
我也不知道你的偏好是什么
How could I know which what your preference is?
我不知道
I don't know.
但是无论如何
But in any case,
像月见草油这样的东西实际上可以
things like pre Evening Primrose Oil can actually
促进体内的雌激素通路
promote estrogenic pathways in the body
其中一些可以透过皮肤
and some of it can go transdermal.
同样  因为睾丸激素替代疗法
Likewise, because testosterone replacement therapy
如今相当普遍
is fairly widespread nowadays.
有些人通过涂抹面霜来达到目的
And some people accomplish that through cream.
众所周知
It's pretty well understood that,
如果有人正在尝试睾丸激素替代疗法  他们会避免
if someone's taking that they want to avoid contact
和任何人
with anyone.
避免皮肤接触
Skin contact with anyone that is trying to promote
避免与那些体内雌激素活性更高的人的接触
more estrogenic activity in their body.
尤其是在儿童中
And especially in children.
那是一个
So that's one.
另一个是这个环境因素问题
The other is this issue of environmental factors.
现在  你知道
Now this, you know,
我再次强调
again I'm just going to highlight,
当人们开始谈论环境因素时
when one starts talking about environmental factors
以及他们如何毒害我们或破坏增长
and how they're poisoning us or disrupting growth
或生育率
or fertility rates
它可能开始听起来有点疯狂
it can start to sound a little bit crazy.
除非你真正开始看
Except when you start to actually look at
一些真实的数据
some of the real data,
来自高质量研究实验室的数据
Data from quality research labs funded by
由联邦政府资助
Federal government funded,
并非来自私人公司或其他来源
not from companies or other sources,
真正旨在理解
that are really aimed at understanding
潜在的生物学是什么
what the underlying biology is.
为此  我真的
And for that I really,
我们都应该感谢加州大学伯克利分校的Tyrone Hayes
we should all be grateful to Tyrone Hayes at UC Berkeley.
我记得当我研究生的时候
I remember way back when I was a graduate student
在九十年代后期  天哪  在加州大学伯克利分校
in the late nineties, goodness. at UC Berkeley.
我记得他  他在研究青蛙
And I remember him, he was studying frogs.
他在谈论这些青蛙的发育缺陷
He was talking about developmental defects in these frogs
住在周围的不同水域
that live in different waters around
在加利福尼亚  在其他地方也有
it was California, but also elsewhere.
他发现了一种物质
And he identified a substance,
在很多水道中都存在
which is present in a lot of waterways
遍及这个国家和其他国家
throughout this country and other countries.
因此  美国及其他地区
So US and beyond.
当然不仅限于加利福尼亚
Certainly not just restricted to California,
是阿特拉津
which is atrazine.
ATRAZINE
This is A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E.
同样  这是教科书的内容
Again, this is the stuff of textbooks.
它会导致严重的睾丸畸形
And it causes severe testicular malformations.
同样  接触阿特拉津的后果是严重的
So again, atrazine exposure is serious.
有趣的是  如果你查看数据
And what's interesting is if you look at the data,
你发现的是
what you find is that
在西部和中西部地区的地点
at sites in Western and Midwestern sections
美国有10％到92％的雄性青蛙
of the United States 10 to 92% of male frogs.
这些是青蛙
These were frogs mind you,
有睾丸异常
had testicular abnormalities.
和最严重的睾丸畸形
And the most severe testicular malformations
是在睾丸而不是在精子中
were in the testes rather than in the sperm.
所以实际上是器官本身  性腺本身
So it's actually the organ itself, the gonad itself.
现在大家都知道
Now it's very well known now
阿特拉津存在于许多除草剂中
that atrazine is in many herbicides.
所以你知道  而我会说
And so you know, whereas I would say in
80年代和90年代的讨论
the 80's and 90's the discussion around
除草剂及其负面影响
herbicides and their negative effects
被认为有点像嬉皮士的东西
was considered kind of like hippy-dippy stuff
或你在以下地方听到的东西
or the stuff you hear about at
你知道  你当地的社区市场
you know, your local community markets
以及这些新时代的社区
and these kind of new age communities.
现在有非常可靠的数据
Now there's very solid data,
来自主要大学的联邦资助实验室
from Federally funded labs at major universities
经过同行评审和发布的
that have been peer reviewed and published
在优秀的期刊中
in excellent journals,
表明确实有许多除草剂
showing that indeed many of these herbicides
会产生负面影响
can have negative effects,
主要是通过影响这些激素的比例
primarily by impacting the ratios of these hormones
在母亲或睾丸中
in either the mothers or in the testes,
改变父亲的睾丸
altering the testes of the fathers
或对发育中的小动物有直接影响
or direct effects on developing young animals
甚至可能是人类
and potentially humans.
然后你问：“好吧  人类呢？
And so you ask, "Well, what about humans?
青蛙可以  但人类呢？”
Frogs are wonderful, but what about humans?"
所以这是正在发生的事情的数据
So here are the data on what's happening
而且这还不是全部令人恐惧的东西
and this isn't all going to be scary stuff.
我们还将谈论
We're also going to talk about
改善和抵消其中一些影响的工具
tools to ameliorate and offset some of these effects.
一个会是
One would be,
对月见草要谨慎
be cautious with Evening Primrose
以及睾丸激素面霜
as well as testosterone creams,
取决于你是否想更多
depending on whether or not you want to be more
雄激素或雌激素
androgenic or estrogenic
根据你的需求
depending on your needs.
但是在整个人口中
But across human populations,
精子数量确实在下降  好吗？
sperm counts are indeed declining, okay?
因此  在1940年
So in 1940, the average,
人类精子的平均密度为
the average density of human sperm was
每毫升精液1.13亿个
113 million per milliliter of semen.
这就是它的测量方式
That's how it's measured.
每毫升精液多少精子
How many sperm per milliliter of semen.
在1990年  这一数字下降到6600万
In 1990 this figure has dropped to 66.
所以是从每毫升1.13亿减少到
So it went from 113 million per milliliter
到每毫升6600万
to 66 million per milliliter
在美国和西欧
in the United States and Western Europe.
因此  这不仅仅是美国的事情
So this is not just a US thing.
研究人员还估计
Researchers also estimated that
男人产生的精液量
the volume of semen produced by men
在那段时间下降了20％
has dropped 20% in that time,
减少了每一代的精子数量
reduced sperm count per generation even further.
因此  在1981年和1991年之间
So between 1981 and 1991,
正常精子发生率
the ratio of normal spermatogenesis
从56.4％降至26.9％
has decreased from 56.4% to 26.9%.
所以发生了很多事
So there's a lot that's happening
主要是因为这些被广泛使用的除草剂
primarily because of these herbicides
减少精子数量
that are in widespread use to reduce sperm counts.
这些将产生深远的影响
And these are going to have profound effects
不只是在精子方面
not just on sperm counts,
还有在成长中
but on development,
生理性方面的成长
sexual development at the level of
性腺和大脑
the gonads and the brain.
因为你需要睾丸激素才能
Because you need testosterone to get
通过二氢睾丸激素得到主要性特征
dihydrotestosterone for primary sexual characteristics.
你需要来自睾丸激素的雌激素
You need estrogen that's come from testosterone
来男性化大脑
to masculinize the brain.
而且当然
And of course,
我们不仅专注于精子和睾丸激素
we're not just focusing on sperm and testosterone.
你当然也知道
You of course also know
这些除草剂中的许多正在破坏
that many of these herbicides are disrupting
雌激素以类似的方式
estrogens in a similar way.
或者导致雌激素过多  不好意思
Or are leading to hyper estrogenic, excuse me,
可以解释的原因是
states which might explain why
现在  青春期发生得越来越糟早
puberty is happening so much earlier
在年轻女孩中
in young girls these days.
因此  发生了很多事情
So there are a lot of things that are happening.
现在这是否意味着你必须四处奔波
Now does this mean that you have to run around
并且从神经学上避免任何包括
and neurotically avoid anything that includes
像阿特拉津这样的东西  你应该避免吗
things like atrazine and should you be avoiding
各种除草剂？
all kinds of herbicides?
我不知道这取决于你
I don't know that's up to you.
但是看来这些确实具有明显的不良效果
But it does seem that these have pretty marked effects,
在动物研究和人类研究中都一样
in both the animal studies and in the human studies.
你知道  你可以像这样打开一本教科书
You know, you can open up a textbook like
内分泌学教科书
the endocrinology textbook
并找到Vinclozolin之类的东西
and find things like Vinclozolin.
温氯唑林
V-I-N-C-L-O-Z-O-L-I-N,
这是一种杀菌剂  它是一种抗雄激素药
which is a fungicide and it's an anti-androgen.
你把它给动物  给老鼠
You give it to animals, to rats.
它们不会形成阴茎
And instead of forming a penis, they don't form a penis.
不是说会形成阴蒂
They basically, it's not that they form a clitoris,
他们只是不形成阴茎
they just don't form a penis.
然后  让我们谈谈女性的性发育成长
So let's talk about female sexual development.
和往常一样  我们要做的是
And as always what we'll do is,
我们将讨论正常的生物学
we'll talk about the normal biology.
然后我们再谈一点
Then we'll talk a little bit about
一组非同寻常或不寻常的情况
a kind of extraordinary or unusual set of cases,
但是我们将谈论它们  因为
but we'll talk about them because
他们说明了一个重要的原则
they illustrate an important principle
关于在典型情况下的物质作用方式
about how things work under typical circumstances.
所以有一个突变叫做
So there is a mutation called
雄激素不敏感综合征
androgen insensitivity syndrome.
并了解雄激素不敏感综合征的工作原理
And understanding how androgen insensitivity syndrome works
可以帮助你真正了解
can help you really understand how hormones
激素影响性发育
impact sexual development.
这就是它的工作原理
So here's how it works.
有些XY的人
There are individuals who are XY,
他们有一个Y染色体
so they have a Y chromosome,
他们会产生睾丸激素
that are born that make testosterone.
他们有睾丸  没有副中肾管
They have testes and they don't have Mullerian Ducts
因为在Y染色体上是这个
because on the Y chromosome is this
有苗勒抑制激素
Mullerian inhibiting hormone.
但是  这些人看起来完全是女性
However, these individuals look completely female.
总体而言  他们表示感觉
And in general, they report feeling
年轻时  就是女孩
like girls when they're young,
当他们长大后  就是女人
women when they're older.
但是有一些不寻常的东西
But there's something unusual
在这些人身体里正在发生
that's happening in these individuals
因为他们具有XY染色体类型而不是XX
because they have an XY chromosomal type and not XX.
那是怎么回事？
So what's happening?
好吧  事情是
Well what's happening is
睾丸在制造睾丸激素
the testes are making testosterone,
但睾丸激素的受体发生了突变
but the receptor for testosterone is mutated.
因此  睾丸永不下降
And therefore the testes never descend.
他们没有卵巢  他们有睾丸
They don't have ovaries, they have testes
但是睾丸是在身体内部的
but the testes are internal.
因此  通常这些人会发现
And so typically these individuals find out
他们实际上是XY染色体
that they are actually XY chromosomes.
众所周知  他们的染色体性别是男性
so that you know, their chromosomal sex is male.
如果你想这么定义的话
If you will.
他们的生殖腺性别是男性
And their gonadal sex is male,
但是性腺  睾丸在体内
but the gonads, the testes are inside the body.
他们实际上并没有发育出阴囊
They don't actually develop a scrotum.
他们没有卵巢
They don't make ovaries.
当他们在青春期前后不来月经时
And when they don't menstruate around the time of puberty
这标志着有些不同
that's a sign that something is different.
因此  他们绝不会在青春期来月经
And so they never menstruate around puberty.
如果他们对此进行足够深入的研究
And if they look into this deeply enough,
你会发现他们实际上是XY
what you find is that they are actually XY.
他们制造睾丸激素
They make testosterone
但是他们的身体不能利用睾丸激素
but their body can't make use of the testosterone
因为他们没有受体
because they don't have the receptors.
受体对于某些人来说至关重要
And the receptors are vitally important for some,
对于大多数的第二性征
for most all of the secondary sexual characteristics
我们谈论过的
that we talked about.
青春期等期间的体毛  阴茎生长
Body hair, penis growth during puberty et cetera.
他们作为女性过着幸福的生活
They live fairly happy lives as females.
尽管他们当然不能受孕  对吗？
Although of course they can't conceive, right?
他们没有子宫  他们没有卵巢
They don't have a uterus, they don't have ovaries.
他们一般也不会产生精子
They also in general, don't produce sperm
数量不足以使他们
in quantities enough that they could actually
与其他人一起繁殖
reproduce with somebody else,
尽管有时他们可以
although sometimes they can.
信不信由你
And believe it or not,
而且我不会说名字
and I'm not going to name names
但实际上有记录表明有几个人
but there are actually reports of several people,
整个历史上相当杰出的人
fairly prominent people throughout history
患有这种雄激素不敏感综合征的人
who have had this androgen insensitivity syndrome
或人们怀疑他们有
or people suspected they did.
不说名字的原因是
And the reason to not name names is that,
它会直接关系到一个关键问题
it gets right to the heart of whether or not
他们是男性还是女性
they are male or female.
你怎么说呢？
How could you say right?
他们有XY染色体
They have XY chromosomes
但性腺中有睾丸
but gonadally they have testes that are inside.
但是  如果你看着他们的身体
And yet, if you looked at their bodies
如果你看着他们的脸
if you looked at their faces,
你几乎可以肯定地说
you would say almost with certainty
他们外貌就是女性
that they appeared female.
那自然发生的实验
And that naturally occurring experiment,
指出一个事实
points to the fact that
出现在体内的睾丸激素
testosterone that shows up in the body
并影响事物的受体水平
and impacts the things that the levels of the receptor
对表型有深远的影响
has a profound effect on phenotype.
在外部或身体上
On the external or body plan.
再说一次  我们正在谈论这个
So again, we're talking about this
为了说明原理
in order to illustrate the principle that
为了产生效果
in order to have its effects,
激素并不仅需要存在
a hormone doesn't just have to be present.
该激素实际上必须能够结合其受体
That hormone actually has to be able to bind its receptor
对目标细胞采取行动
and take action on the target cells.
再一次  我将仅列举以下示例
And once again, I'll just throw out the example of
人们在使用运动表现增强药物
where people are using performance enhancing drugs.
尽管这是一个相当广泛的声明
Although that's a pretty broad statement,
如今  有阵风很大
nowadays there's a lot of excitement about
所谓的SARM
the so-called SARMs.
就是有更多的受体
Who are more on the receptor side.
因此  我们将在以后的内容中讨论这一点
And so we'll talk about this in a future episode.
我只是说这是一个预告片  因为
And I just say that as a teaser because
SARM和现在正在发生的事情
the SARMs and what's happening right now
在提高运动表现方面
in augmenting sports performance,
两者都直接与睾丸激素
both with testosterone directly
还有睾丸激素衍生物有关
but also testosterone derivatives
然后也改变了
and then also altering things at
受体的水平  非常有趣
the level of the receptor is exceedingly interesting
并向我们​​揭示了许多方式
and is revealing to us the many ways in which
激素会影响大脑和身体
hormones can impact brain and body.
以我们不怀疑的方式
In ways that we didn't suspect.
也许是最简单的理解方式
Perhaps the simplest way to understand
雌激素和睾丸激素如何影响
how estrogen and testosterone impact
大脑和行为的男性化或女性化
masculinization or feminization of the brain and behavior
来自声明
is from a statement.
它实际上是摘要的结束语
It's actually the closing sentence of an abstract
我的同事Neuronal Shaw
that my colleague Neuronal Shaw
在斯坦福医学院出版
at Stanford school of medicine published.
“雌激素...”
Which is that estrogen,
再次说明  是从睾丸激素芳香化的雌激素
again it's estrogen that is aromatized from testosterone
通过芳香化酶
by aromatase,
“设定男性化的性能力
sets up the masculine repertoire of sexual,
以及动物和人类的领土行为”
and in animals and in humans, territorial behaviors.
因此  它建立了大脑中的通路
So it sets up the circuitry in the brain.
雌激素做到的这一点
Estrogen does that.
雌激素在大脑中建立男性化通路
Estrogen sets up the masculine circuitry in the brain
然后“睾丸激素是控制
and testosterone is then what controls
在成人的生活中去展示这些行为”
the display of those behaviors later in life.
我发现这非常有趣
And I find that incredibly interesting.
你会以为那只是睾丸激素
You would think it was just testosterone
做了一件事而雌激素做了另一件事
did one thing and estrogen did another,
但事实证明  大自然是
but it turns out that nature is
比这有趣得多
far more interesting than that.
好吧  那么哪些因素会影响性发育
Okay, so what are some things that impact sexual development
生命的早期和生命的晚期
early in life and later in life.
让我们谈谈大麻
Let's talk about cannabis.
让我们谈谈酒
Let's talk about alcohol
我还挺敢说  我们会谈谈手机
and dare I say let's talk about cell phones.
我从没想过会做的事
Something that I never thought I would ever do,
在这个播客中或在教室中
either in this podcast or in the classroom.
但是  这些天确实有有趣的数据
But, these days there are really interesting data.
而且我认为你应该意识到它们
And I think you should be aware of them.
首先  大麻  大麻  THC
First of all, cannabis, marijuana, THC.
我意识到现在有很多不同的
I realize that there are now a lot of different
差异在此
variance it's on this.
有很多不同种类的大麻
There are a lot of different strains of cannabis.
我个人不是抽烟的人
I personally am not a pot smoker.
只是不适合我
It's just not for me.
我说的不是道德或法律上的准则
I'm not talking about the moral or legal implications,
在某些国家  它已被取消了刑事定罪
in some States it's decriminalized,
在其他地方  这是非法的
in other places it's really illegal
在其他地方  这基本上是合法的
and other places it's basically legal.
你要检查一下
You have to check,
自己住的地方  并了解法律
you know where you live and understand the laws.
但这里先不提了
That's not what this is about.
但是我们知道的是
What we do know however,
除了一项研究
is that with the exception of one study
有很多研究指出了这一事实
there are many studies that point to the fact
大麻中的四氢大麻酚和其他物质
that THC and other things in cannabis
促进芳香化酶活性的显着提高
promote significant increases in aromatase activity.
抽烟的人应该不会喜欢这样的结论
Now pot smokers aren't going to like this,
尤其是男性抽烟的人不会喜欢这样的结论
especially male pot smokers aren't going to like this
但这是现实
but it's the reality.
记住  你现在听到的背景声音
Remember, what you're hearing in the background
是Costello在打呼噜
is Costello snoring really loud?
要让他入镜吗？
Should we put them on screen?
他不是吸大麻的人  但是你可以想象为什么
He's not a cannabis smoker, but you can imagine why.
过来这里
Come here Costello.
来这里哥们  来这里
Come here buddy, come here.
他睡着了
He's asleep.
过来
Come here.
走你
there you go.
这只狗绝对不需要大麻
This dog definitely does not need cannabis.
这是他在大多数情况下的状态
This is his state for most of the time.
他经常……
He is highly...
哦  他还在睡觉
Oh he's asleep still.
有些观众要求看一下Costello
So some of you have asked to see Costello
如果你只是在听音频
if you're just listening on audio,
哦  好吧
Oh, okay.
让他重新回去睡觉
We're going to let him get back to sleep.
他一直在这里
He's always here,
有些人想要见他
some of you have asked to see him.
Costello也不是抽烟的狗狗
Costello's not a pot smoker either.
他确实有一个狗保姆
He did have a dog sitter that
多年前是抽烟的人
was a pot smoker years ago.
那是他最喜欢的狗保姆  但是
It was his favorite dog sitter but,
我不是抽烟的人
I'm not a pot smoker.
同样  没有任何评判
Again, no judgment.
但是  是这样的
But here's the deal.
大麻
That cannabis,
目前尚不清楚是否是THC本身
and it's not clear if it's THC itself
或大麻植物中的其他元素
or other elements in the marijuana plant,
会促进芳香化酶活性
promote aromatase activity.
现在  这已经被有趣地观察到了
Now, this has been observed anecdotally
抽烟的人的身上发生
where pot smokers have a higher incidence of developing
男性乳房发育症几率更高  之前提到过的
something I mentioned before gynecomastia,
乳房芽发育
breast bud development.
或男性成熟的乳房发育
Or full-blown breast development in males.
可能有些女性想要增加
There may be some women who want to increase
她们的雌激素活性
their estrogenic activity.
记住女性会制造睾丸激素
Remember females make testosterone.
它来自肾上腺  对吗？
It comes from the adrenals, right?
她们没有睾丸
They don't have testes.
所以它来自肾上腺
So it comes from the adrenals
而且睾丸激素也可以被芳香化
and that testosterone can also be aromatized.
虽然通常
Although typically
我们所指的大多数芳香化酶活性
most of the aromatase activity that we're referring to
在这些例子中是男性
in these examples is in males.
因此  睾丸激素可以增加雌激素活性
So testosterone can increase estrogenic activity.
所以你可能会说：“哦  你知道  因此
So you might say, "Oh you know, therefore
睾丸激素会减少性行为吗？
does testosterone reduce sexual behavior?
它会创造各种各样
Does it create all sorts of things
与睾丸激素水平低有关的症状吗？”
that are related to low testosterone?"
不一定  不一定
Not necessarily, not necessarily.
我讲一下为什么
And here's why,
(Costello呼噜声)
雌激素本身在男性和女性中
estrogen itself in males and females
对于性欲和性行为之类的东西很重要
is important for things like libido and sexual behavior.
我将重复一遍
I'm going to repeat that.
如果男性的雌激素过低
If estrogen is too low in males,
它实际上可以抑制性欲和性行为
it can actually inhibit libido and sexual behavior.
因此  你不希望雌激素过高或过低
So you don't want estrogen too high or too low.
无论你是男性还是女性
Whether or not you're male or female.
现在当然是女性
Now of course in females,
雌激素水平往往高于男性
estrogen levels tend to be higher than in males.
我在这里说的很笼统
I'm speaking very generally here.
你只要回想一下染色体性别即可
You just think back to the chromosomal sex.
那就是我指的是XX  和XY
That's what I'm referring to
是我说的男女
when I say male or female,
虽然那里当然有细微差别
although there's nuance there of course.
在女性中  来自肾上腺的睾丸激素
In females, the testosterone that comes from the adrenals
对性欲和繁殖欲望有强大的影响
has a powerful effect on libido and desire to reproduce.
在下一集中
And in the next episode,
我们将讨论它是如何工作的
we're going to talk about how that works
及其与节育的关系
and its relationship to birth control,
它与更年期的关系
its relationship to menopause.
我们还将讨论如何
We're also going to talk about how that
整个事情也适用于男性
whole thing works in males as well.
但是大麻和大麻植物的其他方面
But cannabis and other aspects of the marijuana plant
会影响睾丸激素和雌激素的水平
can impact levels of testosterone and estrogen
通过增加芳香化酶
by increasing aromatase.
因此  人们应该意识到这一点
And so people should be aware of that.
同样  有很好的数据
As well, there are good data.
我可以在PubMed上找到几项研究
I was able to find several studies on PubMed,
指出一个事实
pointing to the fact that
怀孕期间抽大麻可以
smoking marijuana during pregnancy can
改变发育中胎儿的激素模式
shift the pattern of hormones in the developing fetus,
这样可以促进胎儿体内更多的雌激素
such that it promotes more estrogenic outcomes.
刚才我说
Now earlier I said that
男性体内的雌激素是导致男性化大脑的原因
estrogen is what masculinized is the male brain,
在子宫内  也是这样
in utero that's true,
但是大麻似乎起作用的方式
but the way that cannabis seems to work,
至少从研究中我能够确定的是
at least from the studies I was able to identify is that
它促进体内循环雌激素
it promotes circulating estrogen in the body
因此可以抵消
and therefore can counteract
一些男性化物质
some of the masculinizing effects of
像睾丸激素和二氢睾丸激素
things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone,
在主要和次要性特征上
on primary and secondary sexual characteristics.
所以我提到这个是因为
So I mention this because,
你知道我认为当今大麻的使用
you know I think nowadays marijuana use
更为广泛
is far more widespread
当然在青春期
and certainly during puberty
它会对这些荷尔蒙系统产生深远的影响
it can have profound effects on these hormonal systems.
因此  我们将进行另一集
And so we'll do another episode,
会很深入地探究
that goes really deep into this.
但是  是的  大麻促进了雌激素活性
But yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity
通过增加芳香化酶
by increasing aromatase.
几乎每个人都可以体会到
Almost everyone can appreciate that
在怀孕期间喝酒
drinking during pregnancy,
对发育中的胎儿不利
is not good for the developing fetus.
胎儿酒精综合症是公认的
Fetal alcohol syndrome is a well-established
怀孕的负面影响
negative outcome of pregnancy.
这是
And it's something that
有些胎儿有很糟糕的认知能力
there are cognitive effects that are really bad.
有身体畸形  等等
There's actually physical malformation, et cetera.
所以怀孕期间喝酒  不好
So drinking during pregnancy, not good.
青春期饮酒  可能也不好
Probably drinking during puberty, not good either.
因为酒精  尤其是啤酒
Because alcohol, in particular certain things like beer
其他谷物醇可以增加雌激素活性
but other grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity.
这不只是保护年轻男孩
Now, this isn't just about protecting
 不受雌激素活动影响
young boys from estrogenic activity.
它也保护女孩免受
It's also protecting girls from
酒精摄入导致雌激素过多或过少的危险
excessive or even hypo estrogenic effects of alcohol
在青春期
in puberty.
现在  许多青少年喝酒
Now, many teenagers drink.
大学生喝酒
College students drink
重要的是要指出
and it's important to point out that
青春期不是某一天开始的  然后某一天结束的
puberty doesn't start on one day and end on another day,
青春期有开始  中期  结束
puberty has a beginning a middle and an end,
但是发育确实是跨越我们的整个生命
but development is really our entire lifespan.
这个想法
This idea that you know,
青春期就是这样开启和关闭的
puberty you know has this open and close.
那是错误的
That's just false.
好吧  所以我们谈到了大麻
Okay, so we talked about cannabis.
我们谈到了酒精
We talked about alcohol.
让我们谈谈手机
Let's talk about cell phones.
首先  我用手机
First of all, I use a cell phone.
我经常使用它
I use it very often.
而且我不认为它们是邪恶的设备
And I do not think they are evil devices.
我认为使用它们需要一些纪律
I think that they require some discipline
为了确保
in order to make sure that
它不会成为一个人生活中的消极力量
it does not become a negative force in one's life.
所以我个人限制时间
So I personally restrict the number of hours
使用手机的时间  特别是在社交媒体上
that I'm on the phone and in particular on social media.
我只在一天的特定时间回复电子邮件
I only answer email at particular times of day.
但是手机本身呢？
But what about the cell phone itself?
你知道  当我还是一名初级教授时
You know, when I was a junior professor.
任职初期的教授
I was a pre-tenure early professor.
我教过
I taught this class on
“健康和疾病中的神经回路” 在这堂课
neural circuits in health and disease.
一位学生问我
And one of the students asked me,
手机对大脑安全吗？
you know are cell phones safe for the brain?
而且  所有数据
And you know, all the data
指出了事实  它们是安全的
point to the fact that they were.
或至少没有数据表明它们不安全
Or at least there were no data showing that it wasn't.
坦白说  我仍然没有答案
I still don't have the answer on that, frankly.
我对此没有很多研究
I don't see a lot of studies about it.
我个人不知道任何证据
I'm not personally aware of any evidence
在高质量的同行评审研究中
in quality peer reviewed studies
表明手机对大脑有害
showing that cell phones are bad for the brain
或将手机放在耳朵上不好
or that holding the phone to the ear is bad
或蓝牙对大脑不好或任何有害影响
or that Bluetooth is bad or any of that.
我只是不知道任何质量研究
I'm just not aware of any quality studies.
如果你知道什么高质量研究  同行评审研究
If you are aware of quality studies, peer reviewed study
请给我们一个链接  并在评论部分中加上它们
please reference them, put them in the comment section.
将它们发送给我  用你喜欢的方式
Send them to me, however you like.
我很想看到他们
I'd love to see them.
我不知道他们
I'm not aware of them.
但是  我很感兴趣
However, I was very interested
在特定的研究中
in a particular study
于2013年发表  在老鼠身上研究
that was published back in 2013 on rats.
基本上是拿手机
It was basically took a cell phone
放在老鼠笼子里
and put it under a cage of rats
基本上看了大鼠的
and looked at basically testicular
睾丸和卵巢发育
and ovarian development in rats and saw
轻微但仍具有统计意义
minor but still statistically significant defects
卵巢和睾丸发育有缺陷
in ovarian and testicular development.
既然这样  回到文献上
Since then and now returning to the literature,
我已经看到了这方面文献数量的大爆发
I've seen a absolute explosion of studies.
其中一些是优质期刊
Some of which are in quality journals,
其中一些是我所说的
some of which are in what I would call
非蓝丝带期刊
not to blue ribbon journals.
都声称  仅暴露于手机发出的电波
Identifying defects in testicular and or ovarian development
睾丸和/或卵巢发育中会造成缺陷
by mere exposure to cell phone emitted waves.
我们这样称呼
Let's just call that,
我们不知道这电波到底是什么
we don't know what they are.
这听起来简直太疯狂了  对吧？
And this sounds almost crazy, right?
每当有人开始谈论
Anytime somebody starts talking about
EMS之类的东西
EMS and things like that,
你有点担心  这个人还好吗？
you kind of worry like, is this person okay?
但请看  文献指向的方向是
But look, the literature are pointing in a direction where
性腺长期暴露在手机下
chronic exposure of the gonads
可能会造成严重的问题
to cell phones could be creating serious issues
在细胞水平上的健康方面
in terms of the health at the cellular level
然后在输出方面
and then in terms of the output.
因此  睾丸的输出将是精子的生产
So the output for the testes would be sperm production.
精子游动速度
Swimming speed in sperm
是精子健康的重要特征
is an important feature of sperm health.
在卵巢中  这将是雌激素输出
In the ovaries it would be estrogenic output.
周期有多规律
How regular the cycles are.
所以在动物中
So in animals,
周期与人类略有不同
the cycles are a little bit different than in humans.
它们没有月经周期
They don't have a menstrual cycle.
它们有发情周期
They have an estrous cycle,
一般是四天左右
which is a generally around four days.
我认为这是根据文献说的
I think that it's to say based on the literature,
手机发出的电波
that there are effects of cell phone emitted waves
确实对性腺发育有影响
on gonadal development.
问题是
The question is,
手机到性腺的距离是多少？
what is the proximity of the cell phone to the gonads?
现在  当我观察文献时  阅读过的文献
Now, I've taken the literature as I observe it.
当然  我们会放在评论
And that of course we'll point you to in the captions.
而且我不喜欢把手机放在口袋里
And I don't like to have my cell phone on and in my pocket,
我已经过了青春期  但是
I'm well past puberty, but nonetheless
其中一些影响在成年动物中可见
some of these effects were seen in adult animals.
现在已经在人类中证明了某些作用
There are effects now that have been demonstrated in humans.
因此  让我们仅谈谈其中的几个影响
So let's just talk about a couple of those effects.
因此  一篇论文发表在《临床生物化学》杂志上
So a paper published in the journal, "Clinical Biochemistry"
来自S.Gander等
from S. Gander et al.
根据以下信息查看了人体内的激素谱
Looked at hormone profiles in people based on
与手机的距离和使用频率
proximity to their phone and frequency of phone use,
他们将手机存放在身体上的位置
where they stored their phone on their body.
以及他们住的地方附近
Aa well as proximity of where they lived to,
我猜他们被称为这些射频塔
I guess they're called these radio-frequency towers.
也就是基站
So the base stations.
他们观察了
And they were looking at
射频辐射RFR的影响
effects of radio frequency radiation RFR
在人类荷尔蒙方面的影响
on human hormone profiles.
结果显示出皮质醇显着降低
And they show significant decreases in cortisol.
你可能会说：“嗯  那可能很好”
You might say, "Well, that might be good."
因为你早上都会需要皮质醇的上升
But you need that morning cortisol bump
为了醒来
in order to wake up.
早上皮质醇很好
Morning cortisol is good.
而且甲状腺激素也明显减少
But also thyroid hormones were significantly reduced.
年轻女性的催乳素
Prolactin in young females,
那绝对很重要
that's definitely concerning
以及男性女性的睾丸激素水平
and testosterone levels in males and females.
因此  现在有很好的数据表明
And so, there are now quite good data showing that
如果一天太多时间都靠近手机
being close to the phone too much of the day
虽然“多近”也是一个有趣的问题
and how close is an interesting question
或住在这些基站附近
or living near one of these base stations
显然会对激素状况产生影响
apparently can have effects on hormone profiles.
当你看到这样的研究
And when you see a study like this
一个人应该总是问
one should always ask,
“嗯  还有什么其他事情
"Well, what are the other things
也会对这些激素产生影响吗？”
that could also have effects on these hormone profiles?"
对吧？因为你可以想象
Right? Cause you could imagine that
如果你进行相同的研究
if you ran the same study
生活在河道/水域附近的人
of people that live close to a waterway,
或靠近高速公路  那里有很多
or close to a highway where there's a lot of
公共汽车和汽车的废气
exhaust from buses and cars,
你可能会看到类似的效果
you might see similar effects.
所以你必须对这类研究
So you have to take these sorts of studies
要持怀疑态度
with a grain of salt.
但是我觉得这很有趣
But I think it's very interesting.
考虑到我上次调查这些数据
And given that the last time I looked into these data
当我还是初级教授的时候
were way back when I was a junior professor
我可以找到一两个研究
and there was like one or two studies that I could find.
其中一项研究指出
One of the studies pointed to
大鼠睾丸激素增加
increases in testosterone in rats,
大鼠们离这些
where they were had close proximity to these
射频辐射波很近
radio-frequency radiation waves.
然后在另一种情况下
And then in the other case,
又显示睾丸激素减少
it showed decreases in testosterone.
因此  确实没有任何结论可以借鉴
So there really wasn't any conclusion to takeaway from that.
但现在  有了大量数据
Now, there's pretty impressive amount of data
指出一个事实
pointing to the fact that
这些东西对激素有影响
there are effects of these things on hormones.
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do with that information.
我不会停止使用手机  但是
I'm not going to stop using my phone but,
根据泰隆·海斯（Tyrone Hayes）等人的研究
in light of the work from Tyrone Hayes and others looking at
精子计数并观察精子数量的减少
sperm counts and looking at the decrease in
睾丸激素水平  精子数量和生育力
testosterone levels and sperm counts and fertility
在过去的20、30年中都有所下降
over the last 20, 30 years,
也许这是你知道的  不足为奇
perhaps it's you know, not surprising.
虽然
Although there again,
手机和智能手机的确
cell phones and smartphones have really been
主要在最近10或11年内使用量显著增多
in prominent use mostly within the last 10 or 11 years.
因此很难解释  所有这些下降
And so it's hard to explain all of those declines
是否完全是因为手机的使用
simply on the basis of cell phone use.
激素有一些有趣的作用
There's some interesting effects of hormones
实际上你可以在人的外部观察到
that actually you can observe on the outside of people,
告诉你一些有关
that tell you something about
不只是荷尔蒙水平
not just their level of hormones,
而且还涉及他们的潜在遗传学
but also about their underlying genetics.
这些都与胡须的生长和秃发有关
And these relate to beard growth and baldness.
而且令人着迷
And it's fascinating.
这个分子  二氢睾丸激素
The molecule, the hormone dihydrotestosterone,
由睾丸激素制成
made from testosterone,
是主要负责面部毛发的激素
is the hormone primarily responsible for facial hair,
留胡须
for beard growth.
这个分子
As well, it's the molecule,
也主要负责
the hormone primarily responsible for
头部缺少头发  是让人脱发的激素
lack of hair on the head, for hair loss.
那怎么运作的呢？
So how does that work?
好吧  DHT在体内循环
Well, DHT circulates in the body
它结合在脸上的DHT受体上
and it binds to DHT receptors in the face
促进毛发生长
to promote hair growth.
但它与头皮上的DHT受体结合
But it binds to DHD receptors on the scalp
促进脱发
to promote hair loss.
并非偶然
Not incidentally,
旨在防止脱发的药物
the drugs that are designed to prevent hair loss
是5-α-还原酶抑制剂
are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.
还记得Guevedoces的5-α-还原酶吗？
So remember 5-alpha-reductase from the Guevedoces?
好吧  发现Güevedoces的人
Well, the people that discovered the Güevedoces,
继续做了很多研究
went on to do a lot of research
在潜在的生物化学上
on the underlying biochemistry
研究这个真正有趣的分子  二氢睾丸激素
of this really interesting molecule dihydrotestosterone.
他们鉴定出5-α-还原酶
They identified 5-alpha-reductase.
和5-α-还原酶抑制剂
and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors
是大多数
are the basis of most of the
防脱发治疗中含有的物质
anti-hair loss treatments that are out there.
因此  这里有一些有趣的事情
And so there's some interesting things here.
首先  副作用概况
First of all, the side effect profiles
这些脱发疗法中
of those treatments for hair loss
在许多人中都非常严重
are quite severe in many individuals.
记住DHT是主要的雄激素
Remember DHT is the primary androgen
用于性欲  用于加强结缔组织修复
for libido, for strengthened connective tissue repair,
侵略性
for aggression.
即使这种侵略固然可以制止
Even if that aggression of course is held in check,
但只是一种野心和侵略性
but just sort of ambition and aggression
与多巴胺有关
is related to dopamine,
但在睾丸激素通路中
but within the testosterone pathway,
虽然比睾丸激素少
less so pure testosterone,
虽然纯睾丸激素也有作用
although pure testosterone has its effects.
但是DHT存在于包括人类在内的灵长类动物中
But DHT is, at least in primate species including humans,
是大多数这类作用中占主导地位的雄激素
is the dominant androgen for most of those sorts of effects.
如果你看着某人
And if you look at somebody,
每个人都可以预测是否
everyone can predict whether or not
之后会秃顶
they're going to go bald based on looking at their,
我们总是说  看一下母亲的父亲
we're always taught our mother's father.
因此  如果你母亲的父亲是秃头
So if your mother's father was bald,
更有可能
there's a higher probability that
你要秃头了
you're going to go bald.
头皮上DHT受体的模式
The pattern of DHT receptors on the scalp,
会决定你是否会到处秃头
will dictate whether or not you're going to go bald everywhere
或者只是在前面或所谓的冠型脱发
or just in the front or the so called crown type baldness.
胡须的密度告诉你有关
And the density of the beard tells you about
DHT受体的密度
the density of DHT receptors.
现在  这随 遗传背景而变化
Now this varies by background, by genetic background.
实际上  在当今世界范围内
And actually around the world nowadays,
因为人们旅行和人们
because people travel and people
结成夫妻并有孩子
form couples and have kids with
许多不同文化背景的人
so many different people of different mixed cultures.
你正在看到这种现象开始消失
You're seeing this starting to disappear.
但是世界上有些地区
But there are areas areas of the world
在那里的所有男人
where all the men seem to
似乎都具有相同的脱发模式
have the same pattern of baldness,
就像中央的秃头一样
like a strip of baldness down the center,
头发仍然留在侧面  留着胡须
with hair still on the sides and and full beards.
这是因为DHT受体的这些模式
That's because these patterns of DHT receptors
是由基因决定的
are genetically determined.
在其他地方  睾丸激素水平仍然可能很高
Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still be very high,
血液中的DHT水平可能很高
DHT levels in the blood can be very high
但是人们的胡须会很稀或没有胡须
and yet people will have very light beards or no beards.
那是因为
And that's because
他们的脸上没有很多DHT受体
they don't have a lot of DHT receptors in the face.
在其他文化中
And in still other cultures
你会看到留着大胡子的人
you'll see people with huge beard,
超多胡须
tons of beard.
他们的胡须一直长到眼睛
Their beards are growing all the way up to their eyes
他们有一头巨大的头发
and they have huge heads of hair.
那是因为他们有很多
And that's because they have a lot of
DHT受体在脸上  头皮上就没有什么
DHT receptors on the faceand not on the scalp.
所以DHT有很多作用
So there are a lot of effects of DHT
你可以在男性表型中看到
that you can just see in male phenotypes.
有趣的是  这些脱发药
And it's interesting that these hair loss drugs
就是
that are,
或预防脱发的药物
or to prevent hair loss drugs,
直接旨在预防
are directly aimed at preventing
睾丸激素向二氢睾丸激素的转化
the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone.
这就是为什么他们在某种程度上可以防止脱发的原因
And that's why they to some extent prevent hair loss,
但在某种程度上也有
but also to some extent have,
与低DHT相关的一堆副作用
a bunch of side effects that are associated with low DHT.
沿着这些思路  有一个特殊的
Along these lines there's a particular
许多人使用的运动补充剂称为肌酸
sports supplement that a lot of people use called Creatine.
肌酸  现在有很多研究表明
Creatine, now there's a lot of research showing that
肌酸可以将更多的水带入肌肉
Creatine can bring more more water into the muscle.
它可以支撑力量
It can support strength.
它可以做很多其他事情
It does a number of other things.
甚至可能有一些重要的认知促进作用
Might even have some important cognitive promoting.
认知增强作用虽然轻微
Cognitive enhancement effects, although mild.
那里的研究表明它可能是有意义的
The studies there show that it can be significant.
有些人  并非都是轶事
Some people, not all it's more anecdotal,
报告肌酸促进脱发
report that creatine promotes hair loss.
它因人而异
It differs by individual.
对于某些人来说是的  对于其他人则不是
For some people that's true, for others no.
但是  确实出现了
But yes it does appear,
根据我在PubMed上找到的研究
based on the studies I was able to find on PubMed,
肌酸确实促进5-α-还原酶活性
that creatine does promote 5-alpha-reductase activity
因此  睾丸激素的转化
and therefore the conversion of testosterone
变成二氢睾丸激素
into dihydrotestosterone.
因此  它有可能促进
And so it makes sense that it might promote
一定程度的脱发  以及胡须的生长
some degree of hair loss, as well as beard growth,
以及DHT的其他效果
as well as the other effects of DHT.
我记得在初中和初中
I recall in junior high school and middle school,
一个夏天回家  那是七年级
going home one Summer it was seventh grade,
到八年级的暑假
coming back in the eighth grade
和一个小时候的朋友
and a kid that I knew that I was friends with,
上一次见他还是很小的小孩
went from being like a young kid to,
然后这次他就像个成年男子  留着胡须
he was like a grown man, he had a full beard.
这是惊人的
It was amazing.
他好像彻底改变了一样
It was like he would completely transformed.
正如我之前所说的  在青春期
And in puberty as I've said before,
无疑是我们将经历的
is without a doubt the most accelerated
最快速的发育速度
rate of development that we will go through
在我们生命中的任何时候
at any point in our lives.
就婴儿而言  甚至比婴儿期还快
Even faster than infancy just in terms of the
大量不同的认知变化
huge number of different cognitive changes
和身体的变化
and physical changes.
毫不奇怪  同一个人
Not surprisingly that same individual
他二十多岁时就已经快全秃完了
was mostly or bald by his early twenties.
那是因为他
And that's because he must have had
DHT的含量一定非常高
just exceedingly high levels of DHT.
我也跟这个孩子踢足球
I also played soccer with this kid
他基本上就特别轻松地绕过所有人
and he was basically like dribbling past everybody.
像个大男人
It who was like a grown man,
和一群小孩踢足球
playing soccer with a bunch of little kids.
20岁大胡须子  秃头
Full beard you know, bald at 20.
如此成熟的速度  衰老的速度
And so the rate of maturation, the rate of aging
非常有趣
is very interesting.
很难知道衰老的速度
It's hard to know rate of aging.
现在有一些基因测试
There's some genetic tests that now
可以让你做到这一点
can allow you to do that.
诸如Horvath Clocks之类的东西
Things like Horvath Clocks and things of that sort.
大卫·辛克莱尔（David Sinclair）在哈佛大学和其他学校的很棒的作品
Beautiful work of David Sinclair at Harvard and others
指出了这一点
has pointed to this.
进入和退出青春期的速度可能是
The speed of entry and exit from puberty might be,
这边只是个可能  假设
I'm putting it out there as a hypothesis.
可能是一个有趣的窗口
Might be an interesting window,
经历一个人有多快
into how fast one is going through
他们的衰老或发育弧线
their aging or developmental arc.
因为发育当然
Because development of course,
不只是从出生开始到青春期结束
doesn't just start at birth and end after puberty.
它延续了你的一生
It continues your entire life.
所以我认为这很有趣
So I think it's interesting.
你会经常看到人们  男孩和女孩
You will often see that people, boys and girls.
我应该说男孩或女孩
I should say boys or girls,
会发育出第二性征
will develop secondary sexual characteristics
以不同的速度
at different rates.
有时是顺序的
And sometimes it's sequential.
你知道你可能会看到一个孩子会
You know you might see a kid will,
她会长得很高
she'll grow very tall
或者突然长高
or she'll have a big growth spurt,
但随后乳房发育会稍晚一些
but then breast development will come a little bit later.
然后其他功能在之后发育出来
And then other features will come a little bit later.
你也可以在男孩中看到这一点
You can also see this in boys.
我之前提到的那个人
The person that I referred to earlier,
我的一个留满胡须的朋友  秃了头
my friend that developed a full beard, you know, went bald.
他也很有肌肉  他是一位很好的运动员
He was also quite muscular, he was a great athlete.
因此  他的青春期过得很快
So he went through puberty exceedingly fast.
其他人更慢地度过青春期
Other people go through it more slowly.
有些人会在14岁时进入青春期
Some people will go through puberty at age 14,
但是他们不会开始马上长胡须
but they won't start to accumulate facial hair
直到很多很多以后
until much, much later.
或者他们的声音会很早就改变
Or their voice will change first, very early.
然后他们却没有
And then they won't get
其他第二性征
the other secondary sexual characteristics
直到再过很久以后
until much later.
因此  我们真的不知道这将如何影响或联系
And so, we don't really know how that impacts
整体轨迹或衰老速率
or relates to overall trajectory or rate of aging.
但这是一件有趣的事情
But it's an interesting thing to think about
为我们每个人
for each and every one of us.
我跟大家说一个
I'm going to offer you the opportunity
你们可以做的实验
to do an experiment today,
在收听播客时
while listening to the podcast.
但是首先我想告诉你一个故事
But first I want to tell you a story about
鬣狗  职业棒球
hyenas, professional baseball
阴蒂是阴茎的大小
and clitoris's the size of penises.
当我在加州大学伯克利分校读研究生时
So when I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley,
我们系有一位教授
we had a professor in our department,
杰出的科学家史蒂夫·格里克曼（Steve Glickman）
phenomenal scientist named Steve Glickman.
史蒂夫·格里克曼（Steve Glickman）有鬣狗群落  斑点鬣狗
Steve Glickman, had a colony of hyenas, spotted hyenas
住在笼子里的笼子里
that lived, within caged enclosures of course,
在加州大学伯克利分校校园后面的蒂尔登公园
in Tilden Park behind the UC Berkeley campus.
机箱实际上仍然在那儿
The enclosures are actually still there.
我经常跑过去
I run past there fairly often.
鬣狗不再存在
The hyenas are no longer there.
这是一个联邦资助的实地调研站
This was a Federally Funded field station.
这些动物是从非洲带过来的
These animals were brought over from Africa
或在那里繁殖
or were bred there.
以及为什么是鬣狗在蒂尔登公园（Tilden Park）
And the reason why they were hyenas in Tilden Park,
封闭在蒂尔登公园
enclosed in Tilden Park.
是因为鬣狗表现出令人难以置信的身体功能
Was because hyenas exhibit an incredible feature
荷尔蒙和社会结构
to their body, their hormones and their social structure.
鬣狗与许多物种不同
Hyenas, unlike many species,
有生殖器的情况
have a situation with their genitalia where
雄性阴茎实际上
the male penis is actually smaller
比雌性的阴蒂更小
than the female clitoris.
我应该说  男性阴茎本身
And I should say that the male penis itself,
看过很多鬣狗的阴茎
having seen a fair number of hyena penises,
不是特别小
is not particularly small.
这意味着鬣狗的阴蒂非常大
Which means that the hyena clitoris's are extremely large.
这件事情在一段时间里很出名
This was well known for some time.
原来  在这些斑点鬣狗中
It turns out that in these spotted hyenas
女性占主导地位
the females are dominant.
所以在捕猎之后
So after a kill
雌性会先吃东西  然后是小孩
the females will eat, then they're young will eat.
最后  才是雄性鬣狗
And then the male hyenas will eat.
还有
As well,
当雌鬣狗生下时
when the female hyena gives birth,
她分娩不是通过阴道道
she gives birth, not through the vaginal canal
我们习以为常的分娩方法
that we're accustomed to seeing,
而是通过一个非常大的阴蒂状的阴茎
but through a very enlarged clitoris's like phallus.
尽管不是阴茎  但它是阴蒂
Although it's not a phallus, it's a clitoris.
它就直接分裂开
And it literally splits open.
如此众多的胎儿在分娩过程中死亡
So many fetuses die during the course of hyena development and birth.
这些动物都有这个
These animals have this,
只能形容为
what could only be described as
非常大或巨大的阴蒂
a very large or giant clitoris.
尽管对于鬣狗来说  它并不巨大  但这是正常的
Although for a hyena it's not giant, it's normal.
它裂开了  婴儿实际上就通过了
And it splits open and the baby actually comes through.
婴儿鬣狗实际上是通过组织进入的
The baby hyena actually comes through the tissue
这是一个非常痛苦的诞生
and it's it's a very traumatic birth.
许多组织被撕裂  等等
A lot of tissue is torn away, et cetera.
正如我提到的  很多胎儿鬣狗死了
And as I mentioned, a lot of baby hyenas die.
关于母鬣狗如何拥有这是一个谜
It was a mystery as to how the female hyenas have this
我们称之为雄性化
we'll call it masculinization,
但这确实是雄激素喷射器
but it's really a androgen jet.
请问  外围的雄激素化了
Excuse me, androgenization of the periphery.
生殖器的
Of the genitalia.
事实证明  经过大量仔细的研究
And it turns out, through a lot of careful research
由史蒂夫·格里克曼（Steve Glickman）  克里斯汀·德雷（Christine Drey）等人完成
done by Steve Glickman, Christine Drey and others.
那是雄烯二酮
That it's androstenedione.
什么是睾丸激素的促激素？
What is essentially a pro hormone to testosterone?
雄烯二酮含量很高
It's androstenedione at very high levels
那是在雌性鬣狗中产生的
that's produced in female hyenas
导致生殖器增大
that creates this enlargement of their genitalia.
因此  如果你想阅读androstenedione
So if you want to read up on androstenedione.
雄烯二酮制成睾丸激素
Androstenedione is made into testosterone
通过这种酶17-β-羟基类固醇脱氢酶
through this enzyme 17-beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase
这是一个复杂的发音通路
it's a complicated pathway to pronounce.
从生化角度来看  这是一个相当简单的通路
It's a fairly straightforward pathway biochemically.
你可能还记得90年代和2000年代
You may recall during the 90's and 2000's
有很多提高绩效的毒品丑闻
there were a lot of performance enhancing drug scandals,
特别是在美国职棒大联盟
in particular in Major League Baseball.
据称
And it was purported,
尽管我不知道它曾经被验证过
although I don't know that it was ever verified.
但是据称
But it was purported that the major
当时提高性能的滥用药物
performance enhancing drug of abuse at that time,
特别是那些名字我们不会提及的球员
in particular players whose names we won't mention
但是如果你想查找  可以用Google进行搜索
but you can Google it if you want to find out.
是雄烯二酮
Was androstenedione.
我实际上回想起很久以前
And I actually recall long ago,
那个时候可以买到雄烯二酮
when you could buy androstenedione
在保健食品商店
in the health food stores.
当时 它在柜台上出售
And so it was sold over the counter.
从那时起  发生了很多变化
So a lot's changed since then.
但是有趣的是  这些鬣狗
But it's interesting that these hyenas,
这些高度雄激素的生殖器
with these highly androgenized genitalia
通过完成
accomplish that through
女性中雄烯二酮含量高
high levels of androstenedione in the females.
现在  如果这很不寻常
Now if that's unusual,
可能更不寻常的是
what might be even more unusual is that
当时与我一起工作的一名研究生
a graduate student that I was working with at the time.
不是我带的  我们没有一起做过研究
Alongside we didn't share research.
她的名字叫尼古拉·锡特卡（Nicola Sitka）
Her name was Nicola Sitka.
她实际上是受过训练的
She is actually a trained behavioral,
动物行为专家
animal behavioral expert.
她曾为该节目的“ BeastMaster”训练过雪貂
She had trained ferrets for that show the "BeastMaster."
她为电视节目训练了狼群
And she had trained wolves for television shows
并曾是训犬师
and was a dog trainer.
她有两条大狗
She had these two large dogs that,
我的狗都会听她的
unlike my dog would actually listen to her
她会给他们下命令
when she would give them commands.
一位了不起的科学家
A remarkable scientist.
她正在研究一种鼹鼠
She was studying a species of mole
也住在提尔登公园
that also lived in Tilden Park.
大家可能会开始对蒂尔登公园感到好奇
People are going to start to wonder about Tilden Park,
蒂尔登公园到底有啥啊？
what's in Tilden Park?
但是住在那儿的那种特别的鼹鼠
But this particular mole that lived there
一年中有一段时间有睾丸
had testes for part of the year
并具有跨性别分化的能力
and had the capacity to trans differentiate
睾丸进入卵巢
its testes into ovaries
为了平衡比例
in order to balance out the ratio
人口中男性和女性的比例
of males and females in the population
使繁殖保持在适当的水平
to keep reproduction at appropriate levels
对于特定的群体
for that certain population.
所以有些动物实际上能够
So some animals are actually able
调整他们是否已雄​​激素化
to adjust whether or not they have androgenized
或雌激素性腺
or estrogenized gonads,
为了调整后代的比例
in order to adjust the ratios of offspring
或那里的雄性和雌性促进后代
or the males and females in therefor promote offspring.
还有关于这件事的最后一点轶事
And the last little anecdote about this,
在科学文献中也有发表
which is also published in the scientific literature,
这很奇怪  但我确实觉得很有趣
which is weird but I do find interesting.
激素是如此迷人
Hormones are so fascinating,
他们对我来说真是不可思议
they're just incredible to me is
回到大麻这个植物
going back to the marijuana plant.
你知道  大麻植物
You know, the marijuana plant
具有这些雌激素特性
has these estrogenic properties.
我问过植物生物学家
And I asked a plant biologist
这是不是不太正常
whether or not this was unusual.
我问是因为
And I asked because
那里有所有这些东西
there's all this stuff out there about,
“哦  你知道的  大豆富含雌激素
"Oh, you know, Soy does this.
这些植物是高度雌激素的  等等”
And these plants are highly estrogenic, et cetera."
虽然我们可能应该指出
Although we should probably point out that
许多工厂生产的肉类也具有雌激素性
a lot of factory meats are also estrogenic.
所以这不是肉对植物的事
So this isn't a meat versus plants thing.
但是这位植物生物学家告诉我
But this plant biologist told me,
“哦  是的  有一些植物可以
"Oh yeah, there are plants that make
基本上等于睾丸激素
what is essentially the equivalent of testosterone
就像松花粉  因为它看起来很像睾丸激素
like pine pollen as it looks a lot like testosterone.
还有其他植物
And there are other plants that make
会制造雌激素
what is essentially estrogen.
我说：“好吧  它们为什么要这么做？”
And I said, "Well, why would they do that?"
嗯  你知道植物
Well and you know plants,
至少据我所知
at least as far as I know,
没有意识
don't have a consciousness.
它们没有大脑
They don't have a brain.
它们甚至没有神经元
They don't have neurons even but,
他的回答令人着迷
his answer was fascinating.
他说  有些植物发育了这种能力
He said that, one of the reasons why some plants
其中一个原因是因为
have evolved this capacity
为了增加雌激素水平
to increase estrogen levels
在抽烟的动物中增加雌激素  不是
in animals that smoke, not smoke it
我是说会消耗它们的动物
but then animals that consume them.
我猜想动物不抽大麻
I'm guessing that animals aren't smoking marijuana.
虽然我不知道  但请发给我
Although I don't know, send me the paper
如果你听说过这一点
if you've heard of this.
就是植物找到了方法
Is that plants have figured out ways.
它们采用了各种方法来减少群体数量
They've adapted ways to push back on populations
啮齿动物和其他食用它们的动物
of rodents and other species of animals that eat them.
所以植物从事一种
So plants are engaged in a kind of
植物对动物的战争
plant to animal warfare
它们增加雌激素
where they increase the estrogen
该群体密度中男性的比例
of the males in that population
减少精子数量
to lower the sperm counts,
使这些人口保持在一定水平
to keep those populations clamped at certain levels
使这些植物可以继续繁衍
so that those plants can continue to flourish.
即使那些动物繁殖非常强劲
Even if those animals are reproducing very robustly.
我觉得这很有趣
And I find this just fascinating.
因此荷尔蒙
And hormones therefore,
不只是影响组织的生长和发育
aren't just impacting tissue growth and development
在个人内部和母亲之间
within the individual and between the mother.
请记住  胎盘是内分泌器官
Remember the placenta is an endocrine organ,
还有后代
and the offspring,
但是动植物正在交流中
but plants and animals are in this communication.
今天  我们正在交流中
And today we're in this communication,
我告诉你
I'm telling you that
人类正在使用某些除草剂
there are certain herbicides that humans are using
有很好的数据
for which there's very good data,
正在破坏内分泌通路
are disrupting the endocrine pathways.
因此  令人着迷的是
And so it's fascinating that
人类和其他动物
humans and other animals,
我们总是在这种相互作用中
we're always in this interplay
与植物和环境中的其他事物
with plants and the other things in our environment.
和激素并调节激素水平
And hormones and adjusting the hormone levels
动物和植物是其中一种方式
of animals and plants is one way in which
环境又开始后退
the environment kind of pushes back
或向前推  
or pushes forward if you will,
为了促进它们的福祉和长寿
in terms of promoting their well-being and longevity,
以及你 人类尝试提升
as well as you trying to promote
人类的健康和长寿
your wellbeing and longevity.
如果有人想看这篇令人难以置信的论文
If anyone wants to see the incredible paper
史蒂夫·格里克曼（Steve Glickman）和同事
by Steve Glickman and colleagues.
它发表在国家科学院的议事录中
It was published in the proceedings of the national Academy.
首先是1987年  即格里克曼（Glickman）等人
First in 1987, that's Glickman et al.
那是假说是雄烯二酮
That was the hypothesis that it was androstenedione .
然后  如果你只是Google
And then if you just Google
Glickman鬣狗科学杂志
Glickman hyenas science magazine,
有一个漂亮的封面文章和功能
there's a beautiful cover article and feature
关于这一重要发现的一切
all about that important discovery,
这是一个令人着迷的
it's a fascinating one.
我还要提到的是  这些发现
And I should mention also that those discoveries,
鼹鼠和鬣狗不只是
both the moles and the hyenas weren't just
对动物行为世界有影响
impactful for the world of animal behavior
和内分泌学
and endocrinology,
他们也极大地影响了理解
they've also strongly impacted understanding
诊所出现的情况
of conditions that show up in the clinic,
我们今天没有谈论过
which we haven't talked about today.
这实际上是假性雌雄同体
Which is actually pseudo hermaphroditism.
有时婴儿出生的时候会性别不明
Occasionally babies will be born where it is unclear,
前提是基于生殖器来判断的男孩或女孩
if they are boys or girls based on the genitalia.
这具有非常重要的道德和其他问题
And this has a very important ethical and other issues.
你是把他/她当男孩还是女孩抚养？
Do you raise them as a boy or a girl?
发生这种情况并不少见
It's not super uncommon for this to happen.
在一些可怕的情况下  人们
And there have been terrible cases where people have
违背了染色体性
gone against the chromosomal sex.
这个人对于
And the person was very unhappy
他们的父母为他们做出的选择非常不满
with the the choice that their parents had made for them.
在某些情况下
There were also cases where
他们按照染色体性别抚养
they've gone with a chromosomal sex
这个人对结果感到非常高兴
and the person was very happy about the outcome.
在某些情况下
There've been cases where
他们会用激素治疗了
they've been treated with hormones
在某些情况下  他们没有
and there been cases where they have not
用激素治疗
been treated with hormones.
这是一本复杂的文学作品
It's a complicated literature and
必须根据具体情况进行分类
it has to be sorted out on kind of a case by case basis,
但这确实会发生
but it is something that does happen.
以及鬣狗中雄烯二酮的研究
And the studies on androstenedione in hyenas
在这些非常有趣的鼹鼠中
and in these very interesting moles,
住在蒂尔登公园（Tilden Park）的假雌雄同体鼹鼠
pseudo-hermaphroditic moles that live in Tilden Park,
不仅影响了科学
have impacted not just the science
但是围绕这些重要问题的疗法
but the therapeutics around those important issues.
所以最后
So now last but not least,
我想讨论激素的作用
I want to discuss the effects of hormones
当你和我分别在子宫里的时候
while you and I were separately in utero
以及对我们是谁的影响
and the effects that that had on who we are,
我们选为伴侣的人
who we select as mates.
所以选择伴侣  性偏爱
So mate choice, sexual preference.
以及你所说的所有其他方面
And all other aspects of what you would call
性发育
sexual development.
现在  这是很多流行媒体所关注的
Now this is something that's gotten a lot of popular press
它与
and it has to do with
特别是如何接触雄激素
how exposure to androgens in particular
当我们在子宫内时
while we were in utero,
影响人们是否表明
impacted whether or not people report
自己是同性恋  异性恋
as homosexual, heterosexual,
自我认定为男性还是女性
identify as male or female.
我对这项工作非常熟悉
I'm very familiar with this work
因为我是研究生
because I was a graduate student
在最初发表这项工作的部门
in the department that first published this work
我是这篇论文的作者
and I'm an author on the paper.
我不是这项工作的主要推动力
I was not the main driver of the work,
但我参与了这项工作
but I was involved in the work.
我当然认识从事这项工作的人
And I certainly know the people that did this work.
首先  它是从一个故事开始的
First it starts with a story.
现在有一个研究人员还在继续
There was a researcher who's still going now.
他的名字叫丹尼斯·麦克法登
His name is Dennis McFadden.
我相信他当时在UT奥斯汀分校
I believe he was at UT Austin back then.
他正在研究听觉系统
And he was studying the auditory system.
人们会进入他的诊所  他会
And people would come into his clinic and he would,
或他的实验室
or his laboratory.
他会检查他们的听力
And he would look at hearing
他会探索不同的方面
and he would explore different aspects
他们所谓的听觉心理物理学
of what they call the psychophysics of hearing
并了解听力阈值
and understanding hearing thresholds
和频率阈值
and frequency thresholds.
然后他做了几点观察
And he made several observations.
这些观察是
And those observations were that
年轻男性倾向于
young males tended to have
所谓的自动声发出
what are called auto acoustic emissions,
比年轻女性更多
more often than young females did.
顾名思义  自动声音发出
Auto acoustic emissions, as the name suggests,
实际发出声音的是耳朵
are the ears actually making sounds.
现在这些声音必须被
Now these sounds have to be picked up
特殊的仪器检测到
by a special apparatus,
仪器可以听到那个频率
because they can hear into that frequency.
但是事实证明  你的耳朵不只是
But it turns out that your ears don't just
接收声波并将其转换为
take sound waves and convert them into
我们称此为听觉
this thing we call hearing.
但是在某些情况下它们也会发出声音
But they also in some cases make sound.
因此  你的耳朵正在发出声音
So your ears are making sounds.
奇怪吧？
Strange right?
事实证明  有一个
So it turns out that there's a
汽车声发射的性别差异
sex difference in auto acoustic emissions.
事实证明  那些自称是女同性恋者的人
It turns out also that people that self-report as lesbians,
她们也有自动声发射
they also have auto acoustic emissions
明显多于
significantly more than females
不会自我报告为女同性恋的女性
that don't self-report as lesbian.
丹尼斯注意到了这一点  并发表了这篇文章
And Dennis noticed this and published this.
这是一个重要的发现  因为
And it was an important discovery because
这是最早的发现之一
it was one of the first discoveries
指出有一个事实
that pointed to the fact that there are
与性别无关的生物学性别差异
sex differences in biology that are independent of sex.
我的意思是  这是听觉发射
I mean, this is hearing and auto acoustic emissions.
只是为了真正说明一下
And just to really illustrate what that.
前一个问题是什么
What the former problem was
为什么这项研究如此重要？
and why this study was so important?
你知道  很多人都在探索
You know, a lot of people had explored
例如是否
for instance whether or not,
同性恋者例如在男性中具有较低的睾丸激素
homosexuals had lower testosterone for instance in males.
实际上  结果往往恰恰相反
And actually the result often was the opposite.
那些同性恋者或自我报告是同性恋的男人
That gay men or men that self-report is gay,
经常有更高的睾丸激素
often had much higher testosterone.
然后这些研究引起了争议
And those studies then became controversial
因为人们说
because people said,
“好吧  性行为可能与睾丸激素有关  ”
"Well, sexual behavior can relate to testosterone,"
等等
et cetera.
因此  它变得非常有争议
And so it became very controversial.
然后有一些研究
And then there were some studies
试图看一看中的等效现象
that attempted to look at the equivalent phenomenon in
自称是女同性恋的人
people that self report as lesbian.
或自我报告为异性恋
Or self-report as heterosexual.
因此  它变得非常复杂
And so it became very complicated.
但这是对现象的识别
But this was an identification of a phenomenon,
自动声发射
auto acoustic emissions,
它独立于与性行为相关的事情  
that was independent of anything that had to do with
甚至和社交行为没任何关系
sexual or even social behavior.
1998年
1998 rolls around.
我是加州大学伯克利分校的研究生
And I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley
还有一个名叫马克·布雷德洛夫（Mark Breedlove）的家伙
and a guy by the name of Mark Breedlove.
考虑到他的工作  这有点讽刺意味
Kind of an ironic name, given that he worked on.
他曾从事过性二元性工作  现在仍在工作
He worked and still works on sexual dimorphism
在大脑  脊髓和神经系统中
in the brain and in the spinal cord and nervous system.
还有马克  他是一位杰出的科学家
And Mark, who's a phenomenal scientist
顺着大厅走来
comes running down the hall.
我永远不会忘记这一点
I'll never forget this.
他说：“把你的手给我”
And he said, "Give me your hands."
我当时想 “干嘛呢”
I was like, [indistinct].
他就像  “给我你的手”
He's like, "Give me your hands."
然后他拔出尺子
And he pulls out a ruler
然后他开始测量我的手指
and he starts measuring my fingers.
然后他进行了几次测量
And he takes down a couple of measurements
然后他走了
and then he goes away.
我当时想：“干嘛呢他？”
And I was like, "What was that?"
好吧  我在Mark教授的课程中
Well, I was in a course that Mark was teaching
在那时候
at that point.
不久之后  我们进行了马克指导的研究
And soon after, we did a study that Mark directed
探索手指的长度比例
exploring the finger length ratios.
我将解释这些是什么
And I'll explain what those are.
在男性和女性中
Of males and females,
以及自称是同性恋或异性恋的人
and people that self-reported as homosexual or heterosexual.
因此  让我们开始了解基本内容
So let's just get to the basic,
我们首先将其称为性别差异
what we'll call sex differences first.
这些是平均值
These are averages.
我想指出
I want to point out.
每当你进入此类话题时
Anytime you get into this kind of topic,
人们认为这是因果关系  但不是因果关系
people assume it's causal, but it's not causal.
这些是我要报告的平均值
These are averages that I'm about to report.
比率的情况
It is the case that the ratio
D2到D4的手指
of what's called the D2 to D4 digits.
因此  D2是你的食指
So the D2 is your index finger.
所以你的拇指是D1
So your thumb is D1.
那D2就是你的食指
Then D2 would be your index finger
你用来指人的这个
that you would point with.
中指是D3  随便你怎么用
Middle finger is D3, which you whatever with.
然后D4是所谓的无名指
And then D4 is the so-called ring finger.
好的  D5是小指
Okay and D5 is the pinky.
是这样的
It is the case that
D2与D4的比例更大
 the D2 to D4 ratio is greater
自我报告的女性比男性更容易
in self-reported females than it is in males.
这意味着什么？
What does that mean?
这意味着数字D4和D4的长度更相似
It means that digit D4 and D4 are more similar in length
女性比男性多
in females than in men males.
对不起  这种效果尤其明显
And that effect is particularly, excuse me,
发音在右边
pronounced on the right hand.
虽然不总是这样  好吗？
Although not always, okay?
而且它与惯用性无关
And it does not have to do with handedness.
此D2与D4的差异必须正确测量
This D2 to D4 difference has to be measured correctly.
你不能只是看着一个人的手说
You can't just look at somebody who's hands and say,
“哦  他们的无名指和食指差不多长
"Oh, their ring finger and index finger are very similar.
因此  她们是女性
And therefore they are female you know.
或者她们在子宫内暴露于很少的睾丸激素”
Or they were exposed to very little testosterone in utero."
你不能看着别人看到
You can't look at somebody and see that
他们的食指比无名指短
their index finger is much shorter than their ring finger
说  “哦  他们一定是接触了
and say, "Oh, they must've been exposed
大量雄激素”
to a lot of androgen."
你必须实际测量
You have to actually measure it
并且你必须正确地测量它
and you have to measure it correctly.
你必须从
You have to measure it from
第一个折痕的手指根部
the base of the finger where there's that first crease,
一路上去到尖端
all the way to the tip past the.
你不能包括指甲
You can't include the fingernails.
如果你长指甲
If you're growing fingernails,
伙计们  这在这里是合乎逻辑的
it'd be logical here folks.
因此  你通常无法从手背看到它
So you can't normally see it from the back of the hand.
虽然  我不知道这是否会出现在这里  但是
Although, I don't know if this'll show up here but
如果你看着手背
if you look at the back of the hand
有时你可以看到它
sometimes you can see it.
你知道  以我为例
You know, in my case for instance.
让我看看我是否可以做到这一点
Let me see if I can do this.
所以我的D4比我的D2长一点
So my D4 is a little bit longer than my D2.
在某些人中  它更明显
In some people it's more pronounced
那在我的右手边
and that's on my right hand.
另一方面
On the other hand,
实际上  差异远不那么明显
the difference actually is far less pronounced.
是一点吗？
Is it's a little bit.
那里有一点点差异  但是不怎么明显
it's a little bit pronounced there, but not so much okay?
因此  这就是你会看到的典型比率
So that's sort of the typical ratio that you would see.
事实证明  在小鼠和人类中
It turns out that in mice and in humans,
你在子宫内接触到的雄激素越多
the more androgen that you were exposed to in utero,
D4 D2比越小
the smaller the D4 D2 ratio.
意味着无名指倾向于
Meaning that the ring finger tends to be
比食指稍长
slightly longer than the pointer finger.
而在女性中  因为她们暴露于
And in females because they're exposed to
子宫中的雄激素通常较少
less androgen in utero typically.
然后  这些手指的长度往往会更相等
Then those fingers tend to be more equal in length.
这些是细微的差异
And these are subtle differences
这些是平均值
and these are averages.
我推荐你去看论文
I invite you to look up the paper.
它于2000年发表在《自然》杂志上
This was published in Nature in 2000
并且已经被重复验证了六次
and it's been replicated six times.
现在  这里变得更加有趣
Now, here's where it gets even more interesting.
而且可能会冒犯到别人
And potentially precarious,
所以我们要在这里谨慎地讲话
so we're going to step cautiously here.
如果看一下手指的长度比例
If you look at the finger length ratios
自称是同性恋的男人
of men that self-report as homosexual,
他们有D2与D4比率的典型男性模式
they have either the typical male pattern of D2 to D4 ratio
或男性化程度较高的D4与D2之比
or a hyper masculinized D4 to D2 ratio.
现在这不可能
Now this can't be something
由行为建立或修改
that's established or modified by behavior.
这必须是在子宫内就建立的
This has to be something that was established in utero.
实际上  它在出生时就存在了
And in fact, it's present at birth okay?
所以就完全分离了
So it completely divorces
激素与行为之间的相互作用
the interactions between hormones and behavior.
这是我们一直在谈论的重要主题
And that's an important theme that we've been talking about.
我们将讨论更多
And we're going to talk about even more.
下一集是激素会影响行为
Next episode is that hormones impact behavior
但是行为也会影响荷尔蒙
but behavior also impact hormones.
但这是激素影响的情况
But this is a case of hormones impacting
真正应该考虑什么
what really should be considered
主要的性特征  第一性征
a primary sexual characteristic.
因为它没有出现在青春期
Because it doesn't show up in puberty,
它出现在青春期之前
it shows up before puberty.
它实际上是在子宫内建立的
It's actually established in utero.
在那些自称是女同性恋者的人中
And in people that self-reported lesbians.
我记得去那里
And I remember going out there
并收集这些数据
and collecting these data with,
与合作者一起完成这项工作
with the collaborators on this work.
同样  我不是工作的主要推动力
Again, I wasn't the main driver on the work.
但是我参加了一些分析
But I participated in some of the analysis.
自称是女同性恋者的人
People that self-report as lesbians
也倾向于具有较小的D2与D4之比
also tend to have a smaller D2 to D4 ratio.
因此  这与自动声发射研究一致
So this is consistent with the auto acoustic emission study
丹尼斯·麦克法登（Dennis McFadden）出版的作品
that Dennis McFadden had published.
它指出了一个事实  即早期接触雄激素
And it points to the fact that early exposure to androgens
可能会产生影响
may have an impact,
不只是人体发育计划的雄激素化
not just on androgenization of the body plan,
但也会分别作用到性取向
but also separately on sexual preference.
现在  这引发了各种各样有趣的问题
Now, this raises all sorts of interesting questions
关于性偏好的生物学基础
about biological basis of sexual preference.
我会告诉你另一项研究
I'll tell you about another study.
UCLA的一个叫Simon LeVay的人
A guy named Simon LeVay who was at UCLA.
休伯尔和 维厄瑟尔带过他
Who trained under Hubel and Wiesel.
如果你还记得“可塑性”的前几集
If any of you remember early episodes on "Plasticy,"
大卫·休伯尔和托斯坦·维厄瑟尔
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel
我的科学曾祖父们  获得了诺贝尔奖
my scientific great-grandparents won the Nobel Prize
用于发现大脑可塑性的关键时期
for discovery of critical periods for brain plasticity.
他们定义了一些最重要的方面
They defined some of the most important aspects
我们如何看待和大脑可塑性
of how we see and brain plasticity.
西蒙·利维（Simon LeVay）跟着他们一起学习
Simon LeVay trained with them.
然后西蒙继续发现
And then Simon went on to discover that
在自我报告同性恋者的大脑中
in the brains of people that self-report homosexual
有大脑的差异
there is a brain difference.
大脑的差异在于
And the brain difference is in an area called
下丘脑的间质核
the Interstitial Nucleus of the Anterior Hypothalamus.
这就是INAH
So it's the INAH.
因此  有已发布的报告
And so there are published reports.
那是在《科学》杂志上发表的
That was published in Science.
我指的是《自然》杂志上发表的其他作品
The other work I refer to as published in Nature,
而且反复证明不少于六次
and then replicated no fewer than six times.
麦克法登（McFadden）结果表明
And the McFadden results that point to
强大的生物学联系
strong biological correlates
选择伴侣  性取向
of mate choice, of sexual preference.
这些直接与
And these tie directly to
诸如雄激素或雌激素之类的东西
things like androgenization or estrogenization.
意思是我们可以称其为男性或女性
Meaning we could call it maleness or femaleness,
但这是一个棘手的领域
but that's sort of tricky territory.
由于我们描述的方式
Because of the way that we described
可以更早定义性别的巨大范围
the huge range in which sex can be defined earlier.
因此  如果你要测量D2 D4比率
So, if you want to measure your D2 D4 ratio
去吧 别客气
you're welcome to,
但是你也要明白
but you also have to understand that
它不能预测任何事情  对不对？
it's not predictive of anything, right?
这只是通往可能的窗口
It's just a window into the possible
你一生中曾经接触过的雄激素
androgen exposure that you had early in life.
有很多男人报告自己
There are plenty of men who report themselves
作为异性恋者
as heterosexual who are out there
与女性具有相似或具有D2 D4比率的女性
who have similar or have D2 D4 ratios to females.
而且有很多女性的食指
And there are plenty of females whose index fingers
比他们的无名指短
are shorter than their ring fingers.
他们很高兴
And they're perfectly happy
他们说他们很高兴的地方
where they say they're perfectly happy.
我们倾向于相信他们是异性恋
And we are inclined to believe them being heterosexual.
所以有很多不同情况
So there's variation.
实际上  马克讲了一个很好的笑话
In fact, Mark tells a really good joke.
如果你想知道是否
If you want to know whether or not
某人是同性恋或异性恋
somebody is homosexual or heterosexual,
只是看着他们的手
simply look at their hands,
看看他们的D2 D4比率  然后猜测是异性恋
look at their D2 D4 ratio and guess heterosexual.
而且你会在96％的时间内正确
And you'll be right 96% of the time.
因为96％的时间
Because 96% of the time
人们会称自己为异性恋  平均数据
people report themselves as heterosexual on average.
这些数字可能正在改变
Those numbers might be changing.
所以这个笑话真的是关于科学的笑话  因为
So the joke really is a joke on science because,
这是属于具有统计意义的领域
that falls within the realm of statistical significance.
然而  这确实说明了一个事实
And yet it really illustrates the fact that
这些都不是因果关系
none of this is causal.
但这仍然很有趣
But it's nonetheless very interesting
因为这意味着激素正在组织
because it means that hormones are organizing
大脑在早期发育中的方式
the brain early in development in ways that
可能会影响
can potentially impact
在以后的生活中选择同性或异性伴侣
same or opposite sex partner choice later in life.
当然  现在还有其他一些因素可能会影响
Now of course, there are other things that can impact
在以后的生活中选择异性或同性伴侣
opposite sex or same-sex partner choice later in life.
该研究没有研究报告双性恋的人
The study did not look at people who reported bisexual.
对此还没有很多研究
There hasn't been a lot of studies on that yet.
一件事很有趣
One thing that's very interesting,
有一些好的科学数据
for which there are some good scientific data
但也有一些争议是
but there's also some controversy is that,
看来是男性
it appears that the probability of a male human
自我报告为同性恋
self-reporting as homosexual,
随着他拥有的哥哥数量的增加而增加
increases with the number of older brothers that he has.
现在  这并不意味着如果你有一个哥哥
Now, that doesn't mean if you have an older brother
甚至你有10个哥哥
or even if you have 10 older brothers,
你一定会自我报告为同性恋
that you are sure to self-report as homosexual.
但从统计学上讲  某人将更有可能
But statistically it becomes more likely that somebody will
与他们每一个相继的哥哥在一起
with each successive older brother that they have.
想法开始浮现
And the idea that starting to emerge,
在发育神经内分泌学领域
in the developmental neuroendocrinology landscape
母亲身体里面有“记录”
is that there's a record within the mother
她曾携带过多少个男性胎儿
of how many male fetuses she's carried,
因为男性胎儿正在分泌某些东西
because male fetuses are secreting certain things,
二氢睾丸激素  其他的东西
dihydrotestosterone, other things,
可以反馈到基因组
that can feed back on to the genome.
所以这些可能是表观遗传学的影响
So these could be epigenomic effects
或胎盘本身
or onto the placenta itself,
这样有更高的可能性
so that there's a higher probability
在随后的怀孕中
in subsequent pregnancies
该后代会自我报告为同性恋
that offspring will self-report as homosexual.
因此  这是一个令人着迷的生物学领域
So it's a fascinating area of biology.
正如你今天所注意到的
And as you've noticed today,
这些都没有处理
none of this deals with
当前有关性别的争论
the current controversies around gender
以及有多少性别
and how many genders and sex, et cetera
那是一个单独的对话
That's a separate conversation that is
根据定义基于概念
by definition grounded in the kind of concepts
我们今天一直在谈论
we've been talking about today
并且需要发生
and needs to take place,
考虑到
taking into consideration
性的所有方面以及荷尔蒙的影响
all of the aspects of sex and the effects of hormones,
既在身体上  在大脑上
both on the body, on the brain.
我们没有谈论太多关于脊髓的事情
We didn't talk a lot about spinal cord,
但我们将在下一集中
but we will in the next episode.
但是我们只能说在大脑和周围
But we can just say on the brain and the periphery,
早期效果  后期效果
early effects, late effects,
急性影响  意味着非常快的影响
acute effects, meaning effects that are very fast
激素水平上升或下降
of levels of hormones going up or down.
这在月经周期间
Something that absolutely happens during
是一件绝对会发生的事情
and across the menstrual cycle.
以及长期影响
As well as long-term effects
就像这些激素对基因表达的影响一样
like the effects of these hormones on gene expression.
所以今天像往常一样
So today, as always,
我们无法涵盖
we weren't able to cover
与性和荷尔蒙有关的所有事物
all things related to sex and hormones
以及性别分化或发育
and sexual differentiation or development.
我们不可能
There's no way we could.
但是我们涵盖了很多内容
But we have covered a lot of material.
我们讨论了环境毒素的一些影响
We talked about some effects of environmental toxins.
我们讨论了手机辐射的潜在影响
We talked about potential effects of cell phone radiation.
我从没想过要谈论的东西
Something I never thought that I would be talking about,
特别是不在播客中
especially not in a podcast.
但是  有一些有趣的新兴数据
But for which there are interesting emerging data.
我们讨论了有关
We talked about considerations about
月见草油及其雌激素作用
Evening Primrose Oil and its estrogenic effects.
关于肌酸及其亲DHT效应
About Creatine and its pro DHT effects.
关于大麻  酒精
About cannabis, alcohol.
关于对动物施加战争的植物
About plants exerting warfare on animals
通过增加芳香化酶
by increasing aromatase.
睾丸激素向雌激素的转化
The conversion of testosterone to estrogen.
我们谈论了与巨大的阴蒂的鬣狗
We talked about hyenas with giant clitoris's.
我们谈到了可以
And we talked about moles that can revert
从卵巢到睾丸还原的鼹鼠
from having ovaries to testicles.
在整个过程中  科斯特洛一直在不停地打呼
And throughout this Costello has been snoring nonstop.
他错过了这一切
He missed all of it.
虽然他可能在睡眠中学习
Although he might be learning it in his sleep
就我所知
for all I know.
而且我确实了解这期里有很多信息
And I do understand it's a lot of information,
很多细节
a lot of detail as always.
我只想提醒你
I just want to remind you,
你不必一次吸收所有信息
you don't have to absorb all the information at once.
下集  我们将要谈论
Next episode, we are going to be talking about
性科学  动词  实际的繁殖
the science of sex, the verb, actual reproduction.
我们还将谈论
We're also going to be talking about
激素对行为各个方面的影响
effects of hormones on various aspects of behavior
以及调节激素的方法
and ways to modulate hormones,
通过使用行为  进行补充
through the use of behavior, supplementation.
另外  我们将稍微讨论一下饮食和营养
Also we'll touch on diet and nutrition a bit.
我们将要谈论
And we're going to talk about
这些事物和行为之间的相互作用
interactions between those things and behavior,
与重要主题有关
as they relate to important themes
像性和生殖
like sex and reproduction.
喜欢工作场所的表现
Like workplace performance.
喜欢动力和动力  甚至焦虑
Like motivation and drive and even anxiety.
两者之间有一个非常有趣的关系
There's a very interesting relationship between
激素和焦虑症以及探索新奇事物的渴望
hormones and anxiety and the desire to explore novelty.
因此  请记住  在我们前进的过程中
So just to remember as we go forward that,
激素会影响行为  而行为也会影响激素
hormones affect behavior and behavior affects hormones.
但这并不意味着
But that doesn't mean that
切掉一点食指
cutting off your index finger
会增加你的睾丸激素
will increase your testosterone.
