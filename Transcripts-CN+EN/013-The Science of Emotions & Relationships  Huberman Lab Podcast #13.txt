欢迎来到Huberman Lab播客
Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
我们在这里讨论科学
where we discuss science
和的基于科学日常生活工具
and science-based tools for everyday life.
-我叫安德鲁·胡伯曼
- My name is Andrew Huberman,
我是斯坦福医学院神经生物学
and I'm a professor of neurobiology
和眼科教授
and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
此播客是独立于
This podcast is separate
我在斯坦福大学的教学和研究职位
from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
但是 这是我渴望和努力的一部分
It is however part of my desire and effort
为消费者提供有关科学的零成本信息
to bring zero-cost to consumer information about science
以及面向大众的与科学相关的工具
and science-related tools to the general public.
为了与该主题保持一致
In keeping with that theme,
我要感谢今天播客的赞助商
I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
我们的第一个赞助商是InsideTracker
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
InsideTracker是一个个性化的营养平台
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
分析你的血液和DNA的数据
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
帮助你更好地了解自己的身体
to help you better understand your body
并告知你的健康目标
and inform your health goals.
我坚信要接受血液检查
I'm a big believer in getting blood test taken,
因为这只是获取深入数据的唯一方法
because it's simply the only way to get in-depth data
关于你的代谢因子 激素
about your metabolic factors, hormones,
所有通知你即时的事物
all the things that inform your immediate
和长期健康
and long-term health.
如今 也有出色的DNA测试
Nowadays, there are also excellent DNA tests
可以进一步通知你
that can further inform you
关于你的近期和长期健康
about your immediate and long-term health.
现在大多数血液检查都存在问题
Now the problem with most blood tests out there
是你获得了信息 得到了很多数字
is that you get information back, you get a lot of numbers,
他们会告诉你是否
and they'll tell you whether or not
你的数字在正常范围内或高低之间
your numbers are in normal range or high or low,
但是他们没有通知你
but they don't inform you
结果要采取什么步骤
what steps to take as a consequence.
此外 它们通常会非常令人困惑
In addition, they can often be very confusing,
所有因素都是什么 它们的真正含义是什么
what all the factors are and what they really mean.
InsideTracker具有仪表板和平台
InsideTracker has a dashboard and a platform
这使得解释所有这些信息变得非常容易
that makes interpreting all that information really easy.
这也为你指明了方向
It also points you in the direction
某些生活方式因素 运动 营养等
of certain lifestyle factors, exercise, nutrition et cetera,
你可能想改变
that you might want to change
为了使数字进入你想要的范围
in order to bring the numbers into the ranges that you want.
所以InsideTracker有点
So InsideTracker is something
我已经做了一段时间了
that I've been doing for some time now,
这确实帮助我告知了选择
and it's really helped me inform the choices.
例如 我换了
For instance, I've swapped out
我经常吃的一些食物
some of the foods that I was eating regularly.
我发现我实际上太高了
I found out I was actually too high
在某些维生素和矿物质中
in certain vitamins and minerals,
我的别人太低了
I was too low in others.
真的能帮我调整饮食
It's really helped me adjust my diet
还有我的运动方式
and my exercise regimes.
这真的给了我信心
And it really gives me the confidence
我正在走向长期健康
that I'm on the path to long-term health.
因此 如果你想尝试使用InsideTracker

我们的下一个赞助商是ExpressVPN
Our next sponsor is ExpressVPN.
ExpressVPN是一个虚拟专用网络
ExpressVPN is a virtual private network
确保你的数据安全
that keeps your data safe
且安全且私密
and secure and private.
它通过路由你的互联网活动来做到这一点
It does that by routing your internet activity
通过他们的服务器并对其进行加密
through their servers and encrypting it
这样没人能看到或出售你的数据
so that no one can see or sell your data.
我开始使用ExpressVPN
I started using ExpressVPN
因为我的银行帐户被黑了
because my bank account got hacked.
我还是不知道怎么回事
I still don't know exactly how it happened,
但这绝对是一团糟
but it was an absolute mess.
我亏了钱
I lost money,
我浪费了很多时间
I lost a lot of time.
我不想在任何人身上发生
I wouldn't want to have it happen to anybody.
当那件事发生时
When that happened,
我与技术社区的朋友交谈
I talked to my friends in the tech community
他们告诉我 即使
and they told me that even though
你认为你的互联网连接是安全的
you think your internet connection is secure
通常不是
oftentimes it's not.
所以我倾向于使用互联网连接
So I tend to use internet connections
在飞机上 在旅馆 在咖啡馆 也可以在家里
on planes, in hotels, in cafes, but also at home.
有人告诉我 即使在家里
And I was told that even at home,
你的数据可能没有你想象的那么安全
your data may not be as secure as you think.
因此 使用ExpressVPN 你的数据绝对安全
And so with ExpressVPN, your data is absolutely secure,
你的在线活动也是如此
so are your online activities.
很棒的是
The great thing is
你甚至没有注意到它正在运行
you don't even notice that it's operating,
它在后台运行
it's running in the background.
只需打开它 它就不会让你意识到
You just turn it on and it goes without you realizing
你的数据受到保护
that your data is being protected,
它不会干扰你的任何在线活动
it doesn't interfere with any of your online activities.
所以我旅行时使用ExpressVPN
So I use ExpressVPN when I travel,
每当我在房子外面 当我在工作时
anytime I'm outside the house, when I'm at work
当我在家的时候
and when I'm at home.

那是expressvpn.com/huberman
That's expressvpn.com/huberman
一年期套餐可免费获得三个月
to get three months free on a one-year package.
今天播客的最终赞助商是Magic Spoon
The final sponsor of today's podcast is Magic Spoon.
魔术匙是零糖
Magic Spoon is a zero-sugar,
无谷物 对酮友好的谷物
grain-free, keto-friendly cereal.
正如我之前在播客中提到的那样
As I've mentioned before on the podcast,
我既不是生酮主义者 也不是全肉 也不是素食主义者
I'm neither ketogenic, nor am I all-meat, nor am I vegan.
我吃东西的方式是在我禁食的第一天
The way I eat is that early in the day I fast,
然后在中午左右的某个时候 我吃了第一顿饭
and then sometime around noon I eat my first meal,
那顿饭总是低碳水化合物
and that meal is always low carbohydrate,
然后整天
and then throughout the day,
我保持低碳水化合物饮食
I maintain a low carbohydrate diet.
白天禁食和低碳水化合物饮食
The fasting and low carbohydrate diet during the daytime
优化警觉性和清醒性
optimizes alertness and wakefulness,
我想醒着并且能够工作
I want to be awake and be able to work.
然后在晚上 当我吃碳水化合物时
And then at night is when I eat my carbohydrates,
因为它有助于过渡到睡眠
'cause it facilitates
the transition to sleep.
所以对我来说 魔术匙在下午是很棒的小吃
So for me, Magic Spoon is a terrific snack in the afternoon.
有时我什至会和午餐一起吃
I'll sometimes even have it with lunch.
我喜欢它的原因
And the reason I like it
是因为它的味道真的很好吃
is because it tastes really delicious,
并与生酮友好型兼容
and it's compatible with the keto-friendly
或我整天吃的类似酮类的饭菜
or keto-like meals that I eat throughout the day.
他们有各种各样的口味
They come in a variety of flavors,
可可 果味 花生酱 磨砂
cocoa, fruity, peanut butter, frosted.
我特别喜欢磨砂
I particularly like the frosted
因为我觉得它的味道像甜甜圈
because it tastes like donuts, in my opinion,
而且我喜欢甜甜圈
and I love donuts.
作为结果
As a consequence,
我爱魔术勺麦片
I love Magic Spoon cereal.
我可以食用
I can consume it.
它的味道像糕点 糖含量为零克
It tastes like a pastry and it has zero grams of sugar,
并且兼容
and it's compatible
我之前提到过这种营养疗法
with this nutritional regimen I mentioned earlier.
如果你想尝试魔术勺

这个月 我们谈论的都是情感科学
This month, we're talking all about the science of emotions
和与情感科学有关的工具
and tools related to the science of emotions.
我们已经讨论了压力并且让压力有弹性的科学
We've talked about the science of stress and resiliency,
获得更平静的工具
tools to access more calm,
会提高你的压力阈值的工具 从而变得更有弹性
tools raise your stress threshold, to become more resilient.
我们谈到了动机
We've talked about motivation
和多巴胺系统的作用
and the role of the dopamine system.
我想宣布几则消息
I'd like to make a couple of announcements
关于一些新资源
about some new resources.
第一个是我们现在为字幕添加了字幕
The first one is that we have now captioned
所有Huberman Lab的播客
all the Huberman Lab episodes
用英语和西班牙语
in English and in Spanish.
我们能够做到这一点
We were able to do that,
感谢你对赞助商和Patreon的支持
thanks to your support of our sponsors and on Patreon.
所以现在 所有播客
So now, all of the podcasts
在YouTube上具有字幕功能
have a captioning feature on YouTube,
这些都是由专家完成的
and those were done by experts.
因此 尽管偶尔可能会出现错误
So while there might be the occasional error,
在大多数情况下 它们非常精确
for the most part, they're very precise.
我们已经做到了
We've done that
这样 喜欢使用西班牙语内容的人们
so that people that prefer to consume the content in Spanish
或者喜欢阅读
or that like to read the content
英文字幕内容的  敬请享用
from the English subtitles can do so.
我们将继续
And we're going to continue
扩大字幕的语言数量
to expand the number of languages that are captioned
用于Huberman Lab播客
for the Huberman Lab Podcast.
因此 我们要感谢你提供的资源
So we want to thank you for that resource.
现在可用于所有剧集
It's now available for all episodes.
此外 在前几集
In addition, in previous episodes
我已经谈论过NSDR及非睡眠深度休息
I've talked about NSDR or non-sleep depressed.
NSDR有多种不同的形式
NSDRs come in in a variety of different forms,
有自我催眠
there's self-hypnosis.
我之前已经为你指出了一些资源
I've pointed you to some resources for that previously.
有瑜伽休息术
There's yoga nidra.
NSDR的真正目的是迅速达到平静
NSDR is really about achieving calm quickly,
并出于多种原因  以自我指导的方式做到这一点
and doing that in a self-directed way, for many reasons,
为了更容易进入睡眠
in order to access sleep more readily,
为了减轻压力
in order to de-stress very deeply,
为了代替失去的睡眠
in order to replace sleep that you've lost.
它也似乎有助于神经可塑性
It also seems to aid neuroplasticity.
它可以增强
It can enhance
大脑中连接的重新组织
the rearrangements of connections in the brain
在学习过程中发生的
that occur during learning,
有科学的支持
there's scientific support for that.
今天的剧集标题中有一个指向新网站的链接
There's a link in today's episode caption to a new site.
这是一个YouTube视频
This is a YouTube video
那是免费的
that was brought free of cost
在Madefor的人们
by the folks over at Madefor,
以前曾是播客赞助商的公司
a company that's been a sponsor of the podcast previously.
这是一个NSDR脚本
So this is an NSDR script
不包含任何意图
that doesn't contain any of the intentions
或一些更典型的瑜伽休息术语言
or some of the more typical language of yoga nidra,
相反 它只专注于呼吸方案
instead it's focused purely on the breathing protocols,
以及一种身体扫描
as well as includes a sort of body scan
就是你把注意力
where you direct
放在身体的不同位置
your attention to different locations around your body.
它具有非睡眠深度休息的所有核心要素
It has all the core elements of non-sleep deep rest,
但与瑜伽休息术截然不同
but is distinct from yoga nidra.
我只是将此作为资源提供给你
I just offer this to you as a resource.
如果你想使用它
If you'd like to use it,
它大约30分钟长 应该非常有效
it's about 30 minutes long, and should be very effective
使你进入深度放松状态
in bringing you into deep states of relaxation
由于我之前提到的所有原因
for all the reasons I mentioned before.
因此 让我们谈谈情感
So let's talk about emotions.
情绪令人着迷
Emotions are a fascinating
和我们生活经历中至关重要的方面
and vital aspect of our life experience.
可以这么说 情感
It's fair to say that emotions
构成我们认为是我们生活的大部分经历
make up most of what we think of as our experience of life,
甚至我们所做的事情
even the things we do,
我们的行为和去往的地方
our behaviors and the places we go,
和我们生命中遇到的人
and the people we end up encountering in our life,
所有这些真正渗入我们的情感感知
all of that really funnels into our emotional perception
去代表这些东西 不管它们是否使我们感到高兴
of what those things mean, whether or not they made us happy
或悲伤 沮丧或孤独 或鼓舞人心
or sad or depressed or lonely, or were all inspiring.
现在有一件事是绝对正确的
Now one thing that is absolutely true
是每个人对情感的感知
is that everyone's perception of emotion
略有不同
is slightly different.
意思是 你对快乐的想法很可能
Meaning, your idea of happy is very likely different
与我对快乐的想法  完全不同
than my idea of what a state of happiness is.
例如 对于色彩视觉 我们也知道这一点
And we know this also for color vision, for instance,
即使你的眼睛和我的眼睛中的细胞
even though the cells in your eye and my eye
感觉到红色的颜色是相同的
that perceive the color red are identical
直到他们表达的基因
right down to the genes that they express,
我们可以根据实验证据确定
we can be certain based on experimental evidence,
以及所谓的心理生理研究
and what are called psychophysical studies,
你对最强烈的红色的想法
that your idea of the most intense red
将会有很大的不同
is going to be very different
比我对最强烈的红色的想法
than my idea of the most intense red
如果我们选择了10种不同的红色
if we were given a selection of 10 different reds
并问哪个是最激烈的
and asked which one is most intense,
哪一个看起来最红
which one looks most red,
那看起来很疯狂
and that seems crazy,
你会认为像颜色一样简单的东西
you would think that something as simple as color
将是普遍的 但事实并非如此
would be universal, and yet it's not.
因此 我们需要一开始就达成共识
And so we need to agree at the outset
情绪很复杂 但是很容易处理
that emotions are complicated and yet they are tractable.
他们可以理解
They can be understood.
今天我们要谈的是
And today we're going to talk about
很多工具来了解什么是情绪
a lot of tools to understand what emotions are
让你了解你的情绪状态意味着什么
for you to understand what your emotional states mean
以及它们不是什么意思
and what they don't mean.
这样 你就可以创造价值
And in doing that, that will allow you to place value
关于是否
on whether or not
你应该保持情绪状态为真或假
you should hold an emotional state as true or not true,
不管它是否有意义
whether or not it has meaning or it doesn't,
以及其他人的情绪是否
as well as whether or not the emotions of others
在给定的背景下对你很重要
are important to you in a given context.
我们将谈论很多有关大脑发展的问题
We're going to talk a lot about development.
实际上 我们要居中
In fact, we're going to center
今天 我们围绕婴儿期和青春期进行了很多讨论
a lot of our discussion today around infancy and puberty.
我们还将讨论工具
We're also going to talk about tools
增强自己的情感范围
for enhancing one's emotional range
以及在困难的情绪环境中导航
and for navigating difficult emotional situations.
我不是临床心理学家
I'm not a clinical psychologist,
我不是治疗师
I'm not a therapist,
但是我确实有一些心理学背景
but I do have some background in psychology.
今天我要引用
And today I'm going to be drawing
来自心理学界专家的话 不是我
from the psychology greats, not me,
但是从研究情感的心理学专家那里
but from the greats of psychology who studied emotion,
研究情绪发展的人
who studied emotional development,
并将其与情感的神经科学联系起来
and linking that to the neuroscience of emotion.
因为如今我们对化学物质了解很多
Because nowadays we understand a lot about the chemicals
荷尔蒙和神经回路
and the hormones and the neural circuits
构成情感基础的大脑和身体
in the brain and body that underlie emotion.
所以虽然没有
So while there's no
一个单一的普遍真实的情感理论
one single universally true theory of emotion,
在许多现有理论的交界处
at the intersection of many of the existing theories,
确实有一些基本真理
there are really some ground truth.
因此 今天我们将探访那些基本事实
So today we're going to visit those ground truths.
我们将讨论从中出现的工具
We're going to talk about the tools that emerge from them.
我们将要谈论
And we're going to talk about
一些绝对疯狂和古怪的实验
some absolutely wild and wacky experiments
人们现在正在做的实验
that people are doing out there right now,
我不建议你一定要这样做
that I don't necessarily recommend you do,
摄入不同类型的激素
of inhaling different types of hormones
并尝试更快地被吸引
and trying to get attached more quickly.
你实际上要去做
You're actually going to do
如果你愿意 今天提供一些体验性的东西
some experiential stuff today if you like.
你可以实时进行某些操作
There's some things that you can do in real time
在收听播客时
while listening to the podcast,
为了利用
in order to tap into
我将要提到的一些机制
some of the mechanisms that I'll be referring to.
所以今天将非常互动
So today's going to be very interactive
以以前的播客情节没有的方式
in a way that previous podcast episodes have not.
如果我们想了解情绪
If we want to understand emotions,
我们必须看看情绪首先在哪里发展
we have to look at where emotions first develop.
实际上 这是一个关键的中心主题
In fact, this is a critical central theme
如果你想了解脑科学和心理学
if you want to understand brain science and psychology.
神经解剖学中有一个规则
There's a rule in neuroanatomy.
因为如果你看人类的50个不同的大脑
Because if you look at 50 different brains of humans
或者你比较狗和人的大脑
or you compare the brains of dogs and humans,
有很多差异
there are a lot of differences.
某些事情是一样的
Certain things are the same
但是某些事情是不同的
but certain things are different.
每个优秀的神经解剖学家都知道的规则
And the rule that every good neuroanatomist knows
就是 如果你想了解
is that if you want to understand
大脑某一部分的作用
what a part of the brain does,
你必须解决两个问题
you have to address two questions.
首先 你必须知道这个大脑区域
First, you have to know what connections
会产生什么连接？
does that brain area make?
它连接到什么？
What is it connected to?
它从哪里获得输入以及从哪里输出？
Where does it get inputs from and where does it send inputs?
例如 如果有一个大脑区域
So for instance, if there's an area of the brain
从鼻子神经元获得直接输入
that gets direct input from the neurons in the nose,
你可以肯定
you can be pretty certain
在分析气味方面有一定作用
that it has some role in analyzing smell
在测量有关气味的东西时
in measuring something about odors
或分析有关气味的东西
or analyzing something about odors.
现在 如果它也从眼睛得到输入
Now if it also gets input from the eye,
你还可以得出结论 它得到了输入
you can also conclude that it gets input
来自视觉系统
from the visual system that it cares about
它应该对光和光子敏感
light and photons.
这是显而易见的
This is sort of obvious.
但是你需要知道这种连通性
And yet you need to know that connectivity,
你需要知道
and you need to know what's called
该结构的发展起源
the developmental origin of that structure.
你需要知道发展的早期阶段是什么
You need to know where it was early in development,
因为事情随着大脑的发展而变化很大
because things move around a lot as the brain develops.
大脑 当然
The brain, of course
这或多或少是黏糊糊的东西
is this more or less squishy thing
漂浮在一些液体中
floating around in some liquid
塞在你的头骨里面的东西
that stuffed inside your skull.
结果 事情发生了很大的变化
And as a consequence, things move around a lot.
他们并不总是在同一个地方
They are not always in the same place
两个不同的物种不同
in two different species
或两个相同物种的动物 也会不同
or two individuals of the same species.
所以你必须知道它们是从哪里开始的
So you have to know where they started out,
因为它们从哪里开始
because where they started out
告知它们也做了什么
informs what they do as well.
当我们谈论情感时
And when we're talking about emotions,
我们不能指向大脑的一个区域
we cannot point to one area of the brain.
我们不能说那是大脑的区域
We can't say that's the area of the brain
这是引起情绪的原因
that's responsible for emotions.
有所谓的边缘系统
There is this so-called limbic system
与情感有多种联系的方式
that has been linked to emotions in various ways.
我们今天要讨论
We're going to talk about that today.
但是边缘系统只是其中一个组成部分
But the limbic system is just one component
创造情感的投入
of the inputs to create emotions.
这不是情感的地方
It's not the place for emotions.
你不能进入大脑的一个位置
You can't go in and lesion one location in the brain
并完全消除情绪 那样行不通
and eliminate emotions entirely, just doesn't work that way.
所以 首先 我们必须问
So, first of all, we have to ask,
情感的回路是什么？
what are the circuits for emotion?
情感的大脑区域是什么？
What are the brain areas for emotion?
如今 对此有很多争论
And nowadays there's a lot of debate about this.
多年来 人们一直认为可能存在回路
For years, it was thought that there might be circuits,
意思是大脑中的联系
meaning connections in the brain
产生快乐的感觉
that generate the feeling of being happy
或产生
or circuits that generate
感到难过的回路等
the feeling of being sad, et cetera.
这个理论被质疑了
That's been challenged.
实际上 丽莎·费尔德曼·巴雷特
In fact, Lisa Feldman Barrett
一直是真正在质疑这个理论的人
has been the person who's really challenged this head-on,
并有很好的证据
and has very good evidence
对于这样的回路可能不存在的事实
for the fact that such circuits probably don't exist.
但是我认为有充分的证据
And yet I think there's good evidence
对于大脑中的回路
for circuits in the brain,
如边缘回路和其他回路
such as limbic circuits and other circuits
改变了我们的整体状态
that shift our overall states
或我们的整体警惕或平静水平
or our overall level of alertness or calmness,
还是他们不是
or whether they're not,
他们使我们偏向观看外部世界
they bias us toward viewing the outside world
或多加注意
or paying more attention
到我们体内发生的一切
to what's going on inside our bodies.
如果现在这一切都没有道理
If none of this makes sense right now,
我保证很快就会有意义
I promise it will make sense soon.
但是重要的是要了解
But the important thing to understand
确实会在大脑和身体中产生情绪
is that emotions do arise in the brain and body.
它们之所以出现是因为存在特定的联系
They arise because there are specific connections
在大脑和身体的特定区域之间
between specific areas in the brain and body.
如果我们想了解情绪是如何运作的
And if we want to understand how emotions work,
我们必须看看情绪是如何建立的
we have to look how emotions are built.
它们是在婴儿期 青春期(13-15岁)和较晚青春期建立的
And they are built during infancy, adolescence, and puberty,
然后一直持续到成年
and then it continues into adulthood.
但是在发展早期
But the groundwork is laid down early in development
当我们还是个小孩的时候  就奠定了基础
when we are small children.
因此 让我们考虑一下
So let's think about
来到这个世界上的婴儿会发生什么
what happens to a baby that comes into the world.
一个婴儿进入了这个世界
A baby comes into the world.
你出生在这个世界上
You were born into this world
没有真正了解你周围的事物
without really any understanding of the things around you.
那么  你可以通过两种方式与世界互动
Now, there are two ways that you can interact with the world
而且你总是或多或少地在做它们
and you're always doing them more or less
在某种程度上同时在做
to some degree at the same time.
那些是内感受
Those are interoception,
注意你内心发生的事情
paying attention what's going on inside you,
你内在的感觉
what you feel internally,
和外部感觉
and exteroception,
注意你外面发生的事情
paying attention to what's going on outside you.
请记住这一点
Hold that in mind, please.
因为整个生命过程中
Because the fact that you're both interocepting
你的内部感受和外在感受都是真实的
and exterocepting is true for your entire life,
它为理解情绪奠定了基础
and it sets the foundation for understanding emotions.
这是绝对关键的
It's absolutely critical.
婴孩时期
As an infant,
你对自身所需的东西一无所知
you didn't have any knowledge of what you needed.
你不懂饥饿
You didn't understand hunger,
你不懂玩具
you didn't understand toys
当你第一次来到这个世界
when you first came into the world,
你不了解冷或热等等
you didn't understand cold or heat or any of that.
当你需要某些东西时 你会感到焦虑
When you needed something, you experienced that as anxiety.
你会感到警觉性增加
You would feel an increase in alertness
如果你必须使用洗手间
if you had to use the bathroom.
你会感到警觉性增加
you would feel an increase in alertness
如果你饿了
if you were hungry,
你会发声
and you would vocalize,
你会哭出来 你会激动起来
you would cry out, you would act agitated.
你也可能比较冷静 可能会做很多不同的事情
You might cue, you might do a number of different things,
但你所知道的只是内部的感受
but all you knew was what you were feeling internally.
然后你的照顾者
And then your caregiver,
不管是谁  都会对此做出回应
whoever that might've been would respond to that.
所以你会感到不安
So you would feel some agitation,
照顾者会来做决定
a caregiver would come and make a decision,
哦 你需要食物 给你母乳
Oh, you need food, and give you milk,
或换尿布或给你盖个毯子
or change your diaper or wrap you in a blanket
如果你很冷
if you were cold,
但是他们不知道你是否冷
but they didn't know if you were cold,
他们可能会以为你很冷
they could just assume that you were cold.
因此 了解这一点实际上非常重要
So this is actually really important to understand
那个婴儿 当你还是婴儿的时候 当我还是婴儿的时候
that a baby, when you were a baby, and when I was a baby,
我们对外界没有任何感觉
we didn't have any sense of the outside world
它只是从本质上体现了我们的焦虑行为
except that it responded to our acts of anxiety essentially.
现在这不是弗洛伊德理论
Now this isn't Freudian theory,
有它的组成部分
There are components of it
嵌入在弗洛伊德理论中
that are embedded in Freudian theory,
但是所有发展心理学家都同意
but all developmental psychologists agree that
婴儿缺乏能力
babies lack the ability
去对外界产生认知意义
to make cognitive sense of the outside world,
但是这种焦虑感
but in this feeling of anxiety
并感受自己的内部状态
and registering one's own internal state,
然后向外界大喊大叫
and then crying out to the outside world,
通过哭泣或微妙的发声
either through crying or subtle vocalizations,
甚至只是暗示 发出一些声音
or even just cuing, making some noise,
我们开始与外界建立关系
we start to develop a relationship with the outside world
在我们的内部状态
in which our internal states,
我们的变化和焦虑开始推动需求
our shifts and anxiety start to drive requests,
希望人们来响应这些要求
and people come and respond to those requests, hopefully.
我说“希望”的原因
And the reason I say hopefully
是我们都听过
is that we've all heard
大概是关于这些疏忽的情况
presumably about these cases of neglect.
在很多情况下 如果你忽略了一个婴儿
There are a lot of cases where if you neglect a baby,
你忽略了青少年或青少年
you neglect an adolescent or a teenager,
那么成长过程会不顺利
development doesn't go well,
我们将探讨其中的一些
and we'll touch on some of those.
但是这些确实是极端的情况
But those are really extreme cases.
它们有点像脱离与实验
They're sort of like the parallel to experiments
通常是在实验室里用动物做的
that are often done in the laboratory with animals,
你可能听说过这些丰富的环境
where you've probably heard of these enriched environments
他们会给老鼠一堆玩具
where they'll give mice a bunch of toys,
他们会给它们
and they'll give them
偶尔有一些不同的食物
some different foods every once in a while,
然后将它们与其他小鼠一起安置
and they'll house them together with other mice.
然后你发现的是动物
And then what you find is that the animals,
他们会说：“哦 它们的大脑较厚
they will say, "Oh, their brain is thicker
而且他们的神经元还有更多的分支机构”
and their neurons have more branches to them and all that."
但这确实是将非正常相提并论
But that's really comparing deprivation with normalcy.
我们今天要关注的是
What we want to center on today instead
当一切顺利的时候会发生什么
is what happens when things go well,
以及为什么事情可能进展不顺利
and why things might not go well
在某些情况下很有趣
in certain circumstances is interesting.
但是对我来说 没有那么有趣
But to me, not as interesting
就像健康的情绪发展一样
as what healthy emotional development looks like.
如果你尚未获得健康的情绪发展
And if you haven't achieved healthy emotional development,
作为干预措施  在长大之后可以做什么
what can be done as an intervention
来进行一定的补救？
at later times in order to rescue that?
因此 婴孩  你作为一个婴孩
So the baby, you as a baby,
你在婴儿床附近翻来覆去
you're flopping around there in your crib,
你在需要的地方得到照顾
you're getting care where you need it
当你需要时 大概
and when you need it, presumably,
这成为了关于情感的基础
and this gets to the basis of what emotions are about,
情绪真的是在建立联系
which are emotions are really about forming bonds
并能够预测世界上的事物
and being able to predict things in the world.
那才是真正的情感
That's really what emotions are about.
婴儿是否感到生气 高兴或悲伤
Whether or not the baby feels angry or happy or sad,
我们不知道 我们可以猜测 但是我们不知道
we don't know, we can guess, but we don't know.
实际上 大多数时候我们甚至都不知道自己的感受
In fact, most of the time we don't even know how we feel,
更不用说其他人的感受了
let alone how other people feel,
对成年人来说也是如此
and that's true for adults.
所以 如果我问你现在的感觉
So if I asked you how you feel right now,
我不知道你能告诉我
I don't know that you could tell me
即使用任何一种丰富的语言
in any kind of rich language that I would say,
“哦 我真的很明白”
"Oh I really understand."
如果你说你非常非常沮丧
If you said you were very, very depressed
或非常非常开心
or very, very happy,
我会有所感悟 因为那是多么极端
I'd have some sense because of how extreme that is,
但我不知道我真的会知道
but I don't know that I would really know,
而且我也不认为你现在也知道我的心情
and I don't think you know how I feel right now either.
我现在可能很生气
I could be furious right now
我也可能会很高兴
or I could be very happy,
你不知道
you don't have any idea.
当然 我们有称为“表达”的东西
And of course, we have these things called expressions,
我们的瞳孔膨胀
our pupils dilate.
人们可以感受到多种线索
There are various cues of how people feel.
我们将讨论这些线索
We're going to talk about those cues,
但是你真的不知道
but you really don't know.
在这一点上 我实际上只是想暂停一下
And at this point I actually just want to pause
并提到一个非常有趣的工具
and mention a really interesting tool
试图解决这个问题
that is trying to address this question
什么是情感 情感由什么组成
of what are emotions and what do they consist of,
你可以根据需要使用
that you can use if you like.
这里有一个应用
This is an app,
我没有参与开发
I didn't develop it,
我和他们没有任何关系
I don't have any relationship to them,
但该应用是由耶鲁大学的人开发的
but the app was developed by people at Yale,
耶鲁大学从事研究的团体
by groups at Yale who do research,
这就是所谓的情绪表
and it's called Mood Meter.
这实际上很有趣
And it's actually quite interesting.
我认为它是免费的还是$0.99
I think it's either free or it's 0.99.
同样 与他们没有业务关系
Again, no business relationship to them.
但是他们想做的是给人更多的细微差别
But what they're trying to do is put more nuance,
我们的话语更加微妙
more subtlety on our words,
还有我们表达情感的语言
and our language for emotions,
并让你
and be able to allow you
能够去预测你将来的感觉
to predict how you're going to feel in the future.
这实际上很有趣
And it's actually quite interesting.
我现在正在使用该应用程序 我知道你看不到此内容
I'm on the app right now, and I know you can't see this,
但是它叫做心情表
but it's called Mood Meter.
你可以在Apple或Android上找到
And you can find on Apple or Android.
然后你进入 它问你
And you go into and it asks you,
它对我说：“嗨 安德鲁 你现在好吗？
it says to me, "Hi, Andrew, how are you right now?
然后单击显示我感觉的小标签
And I click the little tab that says I feel.
我可以选择【精力充沛+不愉快】
And I can either pick high energy and unpleasant,
【精力充沛+愉快】 【精力不充沛+不愉快】
high energy and pleasant, low energy unpleasant
或【精力不充沛+愉快】
or low energy pleasant.
我现在要说的是 我感到精力充沛+愉快
And I would say right now I feel high energy pleasant.
所以我只是向你透露了我的感受
So I just revealed to you how I feel.
所以我点击了
So I click on that,
然后它会给你提供很多颜色
and then it gives you a gallery of colors,
然后你只需将手指移到该位置
and you just move your finger to the location
你认为最匹配的颜色
where you think it matches most.
当你这样做时 会弹出小的单词
And as you do that, little words pop up.
我知道有些人只听音频
I know some people are listening to this on audio only.
所以说激励 开朗 鼓舞
So it say motivated, cheerful, inspired.
我会说 我现在很开心
I would say, I'm feeling right now, cheerful.
因此 你单击该按钮 然后转到下一个窗口
So you click that and then you just go to the next window,
它只是说 你在做什么？
and it just says, what are you doing?
这就像是个游戏
And this feels like play to me,
但我将其称为工作方式
but I'm going to call it work.
然后就是这样
And then that's it.
然后它做的
And then what it does
基本上就是开始收集你的数据
is it basically starts to collect data on you.
你正在为其提供信息
You're giving it information.
并开始将其链接到其他功能
And it starts to link that to other features
如果你愿意的话 你可以访问
that you allowed access to if you like,
它开始帮助你能够预测
and it starts helping you be able to predict
你每天会有怎样的不同感受
how you're going to feel different times a day.
实际上在某些方面非常准确
It's actually quite accurate in certain ways,
挺有意思
quite interesting.
它指出了几个非常有趣的功能
And it points to a couple of really interesting features,
那是我们真的没有足够的语言
which is that we don't really have enough language
描述所有的情绪状态
to describe all the emotional states,
但是有一些核心事实
and yet there's some core truths
构成情感的原因
to what makes up an emotion.
我想在今天的播客中再次进行回顾
And I want to review that twice during today's podcast,
因为这确实可以帮助人们
because this can really help people,
孩子和成年人更好地去了解
kids and adults understand better
他们的感受以及原因
what they're feeling and why,
以及什么时候最适合从事某些活动
and when best to engage in certain activities,
值得庆幸的是 何时也最好避免某些活动
and thankfully, when best to avoid certain activities too.
因此 其工作方式如下
So the way this works is the following.
你随时都需要问自己
You need to ask yourself at any point,
如果愿意 你可以立即执行此操作
you could do this right now if you like,
你的自主唤醒水平如何？
what's your level of autonomic arousal?
自主唤醒只是连续的
Autonomic arousal is just the continuum,
警惕到冷静的范围
the range of alert to calm.
因此 如果你现在感到恐慌
So if you're in a panic right now,
在唤醒尺度上 你就像十分之十
you are like 10 out of 10 on the arousal scale.
如果你睡着了
If you're asleep,
你可能不理解我的意思
you're probably not comprehending what I'm saying,
虽然也许一点点
although maybe a little bit.
但是 假设你很困倦
But let's say you're very drowsy,
你可能会在1-2分间
you might be at a one or a two.
所以你总是要问
So you always have to ask,
你在觉醒尺度上处于哪个位置？
where are you on the arousal scale?
然后有另一个轴 另一个问题
And then there's this other axis, this other question,
这就是我们所说的“价”
which is what we call valence.
现在“价”是一个值
Now valence is a value.
你感觉好还是坏？
Do you feel good or bad?
我会说我现在感觉很好
I would say I feel pretty good right now.
以1到10的比例
On a scale of one to 10,
我想 我不知道 我感觉是7分吧
I'm like, I dunno, I feel like a seven.
昨晚睡了个好觉
Got good night's sleep last night,
今天早上和科斯特洛一起散步
had a good walk with Costello this morning,
我吃饱了 我喝饱了
I'm fed, I'm hydrated.
我感觉很好
I feel good,
所以我就是7分
So I'm like a seven.
所以我很警觉 感觉很好
So I'm alert and I feel pretty good.
还有第三件事
And then there's a third thing,
我们内在感受怎么样
which is how much we are interocepting
以及我们在外在感受多少
and how much we are exterocepting.
因此 我们有多少注意力集中在内部
So how much our attention is focused internally
我们的感受以及它在外部的关注程度
on what we're feeling and how much it's focused externally.
而且这将始终处于动态平衡中
And this is always going to be in a dynamic balance.
因此 举例来说 如果你真的感到非常有压力
So for instance, if you're really, really stressed,
通常会让你处于一个位置
oftentimes that puts you in a position
真正与你体内发生的事情保持联系
to be really in touch with what's going on in your body.
如果你开始有很多躯体感受
If you start having a lot of somatic,
很多身体上的感觉
a lot of bodily sensations,
就像你的心脏跳动得如此之快以至于你不能忽略它
like your heart is beating so fast that you can't ignore it,
那么你真的具有强烈的自我感知能力
then you're really strongly interoceptive.
但是有时候你真的很压力
But also sometimes you're really stressed
因为有人向你施压
because someone's stressing you out
或有人给你发短信
or somebody sends you a text message
或发表评论
or makes a comment about
你发布的YouTube内容或其他内容
a YouTube thing you posted or something,
而且你真的被它刺激到了
and you're really triggered by it.
这从来没有发生在我身上
That never happens to me.
但是 如果这确实发生在你身上 那么你将感到恐惧
But if it does happen to you, then you're exterocepting.
所以这三件事
So these three things,
你有多警觉或困倦 第一点
how alert or sleepy you are, that's one,
你有多好或多坏 第二点
how good or bad you feel, that's two,
然后是否
and then whether or not
你的大部分注意力都指向外部
most of your attention is directed outward,
或是否向内定向
or whether or not it's directed inward.
我们称之为情感的大部分
And much of what we call emotions
由这三件事组成
are made up by those three things.
现在让我们回到成长中
And so let's return now to development,
先放一边 只是先想一想
but tuck that away and just kind of think about it,
机警与睡眠 好与坏
alert versus asleep, good versus bad,
并专注于内部或外部
and focused internally or focused externally.
因为当我看着
Because when I looked at
所有存在的情感理论
all the theories of emotion that were out there,
他们有很多不同的组成部分
there were a lot of different components to them,
但他们似乎都居中
but they all seem to center back
这三个功能
to these same three features
以某种方式或某种程度或另一种方式
in some way or to some degree or another.
理解它可能会非常强大
And it can be very powerful to understand
并通过镜头观察你的情绪
and look at your emotions through that lens.
因此 让我们回到婴儿
So let's return to the infant.
婴儿床里有婴儿
There's the baby in the crib.
那么婴儿主要是在感受内在
It's mostly interocepting.
当照顾者带来所需的东西时
As caregivers bring it what it needs, you hope,
牛奶 换尿布等等
milk, diaper changes, et cetera,
如果天气冷的话 可以用温暖的毯子
a warm blanket if it's cold,
揭开毯子
pull off the blanket
当婴儿大惊小怪 又太暖和的时候
when the baby's fussing and it's too warm,
因为婴儿也会变得太暖和
'cause babies get too warm also,
他(她)开始外部感受
it starts to exterocept.
打扰一下 我说错了
Excuse me, I misspoke,
我想说清楚这个事情
I want to be very clear,
婴儿开始产生外部感受
it starts to exterocept.
婴儿开始向外界看
The baby starts to look into the outside world
并开始做出预测
and start making predictions.
它开始想知道需要多少哭泣  或预测
It starts wondering how much it needs to cry or predicting,
“好吧 如果我哭一点
"Well, if I cry like a little bit,
那妈妈会过来给我喂母乳
then mom comes over and I get my milk.
或者 如果我哭很多 妈妈还是不会过来给我母乳
Or if I cry a lot, mom doesn't come over and give me milk,
所以我需要真正地尖叫”
so I need to really scream at the top of my head."
因此 婴儿开始评估并做所有这一切
So babies are starting to evaluate and do all this,
但他们没有有意识地这样做
but they're not doing it consciously.
他们正在战略性地做到这一点
They're doing this strategically
为了缓解焦虑
in order to relieve anxiety.
而且我不会提议那是我们成年后要做的事情
And I won't propose that that's what we do into adulthood.
但是我们成年后所做的很多事情
But a lot of what we do in adulthood
就是当我们感觉到某种东西时 我们就开始外露
is when we feel something, we start exterocepting.
有些人好多了
Some people are much better
只是作为一个容器坐着 只是在接受
at just sitting as a container and just interocepting
并注意他们在内部的感受
and paying attention to what they're feeling internally.
但是大多数人都在两者之间取得了一点平衡
But most people do a little bit of a balance of both.
我们感觉不好
We don't feel good,
所以我们寻找物品或食物
so we look for an item or food
那会让我们感觉好些
that might make us feel better.
我们正在急切地去看牙医
We're feeling anxious heading into the dentist
或类似的东西
or something like that,
所以我们给某人发短信
so we text somebody.
我们几乎是自发地做这件事
We do this almost reflexively,
它并不总是有意识的
it's not always conscious.
因此 婴儿可以这样做 我们将继续这样做
So infants do this, and we continue to do this.
我们现在开始平衡我们的感知力
We start to now balance our interoceptive
和外在的专注
and exteroceptive focus,
向内看 向外看
looking inward and looking outward.
当我们这样做时
And as we do that,
我们开始弄清楚是什么满足了我们的需求
we're starting to figure out what gets our needs met.
记住 情绪真的在那里形成纽带
Remember, emotions are really there to form bonds
并做出预测
and to make predictions.
因此 我们的需求将在某种程度上得到满足
And so our needs are going to be met to some degree or not.
有时可悲的是忽略了
Sometimes sadly there is neglect.
有时人们不为我们出现
Sometimes people don't show up for us
我们想要的方式
the way that we would like.
总的来说 我们对此的回应
And in general, our responses to that
与是否
have to do with whether or not
我们预测他们是否会
we predict whether or not they would or not.
当我们期望某些事情不会发生时
When we expect something and it doesn't happen,
这真是令人失望
It's a big let down.
那是最后一集关于多巴胺的讨论
That was the discussion about dopamine last episode.
因此 许多情感理论 三位一体大脑理论
So the many theories of emotion, the triune brain theory,
你有一个原始的 受累的大脑
that you have a primitive and involved brain,
这些天有些动摇
something that's a little bit on shaky ground these days.
达尔文提出的想法
The idea that Darwin proposed,
这些情感的普遍表达
that there are these universal expressions of emotions.
海伦·费舍尔（Helen Fisher）关于爱情的工作
The work of Helen Fisher on love,
你的大脑有回路
that you have circuits in the brain
对于大脑中失去的回路
for lost circuits in the brain,
为了爱和大脑中的循环 以建立长期的纽带
for love and circuits in the brain for long-term bonds,
以及丽莎·费尔德曼·巴雷特（Lisa Feldman Barrett）的作品
as well as the work of Lisa Feldman Barrett,
说情感是与环境相关的
saying that emotions are contextual,
他们有社会成分
that they have a social component.
我将对此进行更多讨论
And I'll be talking more about this,
但是艾伦·舒尔（Allan Schore）的作品
but the work of Allan Schore,
加州大学洛杉矶分校的临床心理学家和研究员
a clinical psychologist and researcher at UCLA,
关于右脑 左脑
about right brain, left brain,
及其在情感发展中的作用
and its role in emotional development.
他们都包含了
All of them have strong elements
对于“注意力”的观点
of this idea of paying attention
向内和向外的变化
to what's going on inward and outward.
作为一个年轻的生物 一个婴幼儿
As a young creature, an infant and young toddler,
你主要是向内集中
you were mainly focused inward,
然后你开始了解外在发生了什么
and you started to understand what was going on outward
作为预测  你开始知道什么为你带来舒缓
as a way of predicting what would bring you relief,
什么会消除你的焦虑感
what would remove your anxiety.
这就是你的基本经验法则
And that's where the fundamental rules of your experience,
你的情感经历被放下了
your emotional experience were laid down.
我意识到很多信息
And I realized that's a lot of information
这有点像学术演讲
and it's somewhat of an academic talk,
但是里面有两个工具
but there were two tools in there
我只想强调
that I just want to highlight,
一个是情绪仪应用程序
one is the Mood Meter app.
如果你有兴趣 它可以为你提供一些预测
If you're interested in, it can give you some insight
情绪中不同的细微差别
into the different kinds of nuance within emotions
并让你实际预测情绪状态
and allow you to actually predict emotional states,
如果你想尝试
if you want to try that
你可能会发现它很有趣
and you might find that interesting.
另一个是这个
The other one is this idea that
三个坐标轴  包含两种情绪
there are three axes two emotion,
相互作用的三个连续体
three continuum that interact,
机敏和平静的水平
the level of alertness and calmness,
你感觉好坏
how good or bad you feel,
以及你是否主要集中在向内或向外
and whether or not you're mainly focused inward or outward,
因为这些将形成有用的工具包
because those are going to form a useful tool kit
了解未来的信息
for the information going forward.
所以现在让我们谈谈你是什么样的婴儿
So now let's talk about what kind of baby you were,
因为这实际上可以告诉你现在的情绪
because that actually informs your emotionality now.
这些是经典的
These are classic.
他们实际上是著名的实验
They're actually famous experiments
Bowlby和Ainsworth做的
done by Bowlby and Ainsworth.
任何学习心理学的人
Anyone that study psychology
或上过心理学课
or has taken a psychology class
可能已经了解了这一点
might have learned about this.
这是这个经典的实验
This is this classic experiment
所谓的奇怪情况任务
of what was called the strange situation task in which,
我在这里非常粗略地描述它
and I'm describing it very coarsely here, I realize.
但是有一个母亲和孩子进入实验室
But a mother and child come into the laboratory.
是的 现在父亲也可以这样做
Yes, this is now also been done with fathers.
婴儿和母亲或父亲一起玩了一会儿
The baby and the mother or father play together for a bit,
然后母亲离开
and then the mother leaves.
母亲离开一段时间
The mother leaves for some period of time
然后回来
and then comes back.
而且研究是专门观察
And the research is devoted
了解孩子的反应
to understanding the response of the child
当照顾者
when the caretaker,
母亲或父亲回来的时候  大多数是孩子
the mother or the father returns, most all children,
并不是每个孩子 但大多数孩子会哭
not every child, but most children will cry
当他们的主要看护人离开时
when their primary caretaker leaves.
他们不喜欢那样
They don't like that.
这样做有充分的理由
And there are good reasons for that.
他们形成了一种纽带和一种依恋
They formed a bond and an attachment.
我们将谈论
And we will talk about
产生这些连接的一些更深层次的化学原因
some of the deeper chemical reasons for those bonds.
但是 实验重点是
However, the experiment is focused
在照料者返回时
on the return of the caregiver.
因为鲍比和安斯沃思
Because Bowlby and Ainsworth,
以及他们的许多科研后继者和同事
and many of their scientific offspring and colleagues
确定至少四个婴儿显示的模式
identified at least four patterns that babies display
当他们的看护人回来时
when their caretaker returns,
然后将它们分组为a b c d
and they group these into group a, b, c, d,
如此之多 以至于孩子被称为 a婴儿
so much so that the kids were referred to as a babies,
b婴儿 c婴儿或d婴儿
b babies, c babies or d babies.
你可能知道你是哪一个
You may know which one you were.
但是类别确实很有趣
But the categories are really interesting.
第一个婴儿  a婴儿
The first babies are the a babies.
所以这些孩子
So these were kids
当他们的看护人离开时 这会很不高兴
that would get upset when their caretaker would leave.
但是当他们的看护人回来时
But when their caretaker would return,
婴儿会高兴地回应
the infant would respond with happiness,
看起来很高兴
with what looked like delight.
他们会朝向照料者
They would go to the caretaker.
他们似乎很高兴
They seemed happy.
如果他们以前太过挑剔或难过 他们会放心的
If they had been fussy before or sad, they felt relieved.
这些被称为“安全附加”的孩子
These are referred to as secure attached kids.
因此他们对分离有健康的反应
So they have a healthy response to separation,
他们的反应很健康
and they have a healthy response
与照料者重新接触
to re-engaging with the caretaker.
所谓的b婴儿
The b babies as they're called
不太可能从照顾者那里寻求安慰
were less likely to seek comfort from their caregiver
照料者何时返回
when the caregiver would return.
所以他们有时会继续玩玩具
So they would sometimes continue to play with their toys
或者他们在房间里有成人
or if they had an adult in the room
父母不在的时候 他们会留在他们身边
while the parent was gone, they would stay with them.
有时是复杂而细微的
It was sometimes complicated and nuanced,
但是这些被称为回避婴儿
but these were referred to as avoidant babies.
不要逃避任何结论
Don't run away with any conclusions
关于这里的语言呢
about the language here just yet.
尚不清楚回避的婴儿会变成回避的成年人
It's not clear that avoidant babies become avoidant adults,
但请忍受我
but bear with me.
c婴儿对于看护人回来的反应
The c babies would respond to the return of the caregiver
是烦人的行为
with acts of annoyance.
他们似乎有点生气
They seemed kind of angry.
所以忽略了他们
So it wasn't that they ignored them,
他们似乎有点生气
they seem kind of angry.
这些被称为矛盾的婴儿
And those were referred to as ambivalent babies,
不要与a婴儿混淆
not to be confused with a babies.
这些是c婴儿 是矛盾的婴儿
These are the c babies, were the ambivalent babies.
所以婴儿的反应
So the infant's reaction
与返回的照料者不一致
to the returning caregiver were inconsistent.
似乎他们想再次与他们建立联系
It seemed like they wanted to bond with them again
但是他们似乎有点生气
but that they seem kind of annoyed.
我想我们之前都已经有这种感觉
I think we've all felt this way before
与我们非常关心的人在一起
with people that we care very much about,
特别是我们非常关心的人
especially people we care very much about.
第三类是d婴儿
And then the third category, the d babies,
是那些无规律的婴儿 这就是他们所说的
were the disorganized babies, that's what they call them.
他们无规律 而且很凌乱
They weren't disorganized and that they were messy,
这个孩子避免了与每个人的互动
the child avoided interactions with everyone
当照顾者回来时表现得很恐惧
and acted fearful when the caregiver returned,
他们的行为并没有真正改变
and their behavior didn't really change
无论看护人是否在场
whether or not the caregiver was there or not.
第四类实际上是添加得比较晚的
And that fourth category was actually added rather late
在这项研究过程中
in the course of this research.
我应该提到这些实验已经重复
I should mention these experiments have been repeated
在各种各样的不同背景中
with a huge variety of different contexts.
玛丽·梅恩做了一件工作
There was work done by Mary Main
在加州大学伯克利分校和许多其他学校
at UC Berkeley and many others,
查看有关该实验的各种变量
looking at all sorts of variations on this theme.
但是随着时间的流逝 它变得很清楚
But over time, it made it clear
某些婴儿能够感到安全
that certain babies are able to feel secure
在与他们的照料者重新接触时 其他人则没有
upon re-engaging with their caregiver and others don't,
否则他们对此感到困惑
or they're confused about it.
所以我们可能不知道
So we probably don't know
无论你是a b还是c d婴儿
whether or not you were an a, b or c, d baby,
除非你在这些实验中
unless you were in these experiments
以及你以某种方式拥有的知识
and somehow you had that knowledge.
但是这部作品 这部经典作品
But this work, this classic work
提出了大量重要问题
opened up a huge set of important questions
与什么是重建
that relate to what is the reestablishment
真正的纽带
of the bond really about.
我的意思是 这里到底想出什么
I mean, what's actually being figured out here
是否有四类婴儿
is not whether or not there are four categories of babies,
那很有意思
that's interesting,
但这可能更有趣
but it presumably is more interesting
专注于什么才是真正好的纽带
to focus on what is it that defines a really good bond,
安全连接或不安全连接
a secure attachment, or an insecure attachment
或回避连接
or an avoidant attachment.
有四件事 首先 注视  是的就是字面意思  眼神接触
And the four things are gaze. literally eye contact,
并不需要直接放光眼神接触
and doesn't have to be direct beaming eye contact
没有眨眼 就像人们以前指责我一样
with no blinks like people have accused me of before.
只是注视 人们互相看着
It can just be gaze, people look at each other,
你看到夫妻 他们互相看着对方
you see couples, they look at each other,
他们并不总是长时间凝视对方
they don't always stare each other long periods of time,
有时候他们会
sometimes they do.
发声 所以我们说什么和怎么说
Vocalizations, so what we say and how we say it.
情感
Affect or emotion,
所以我们表达的方式 哭泣 微笑
so the way that we express it, crying, smiling
等 然后触摸 这四件事
et cetera, and touch, those four things.
你可能会添加第五个维度
And you probably could add a fifth dimension
语言和书面语言发展起来后
once language and written language develops,
第五个就是文字
which is written word,
互相寄信
exchange of letters,
交换文字
exchange of texts,
诸如此类的东西交换 电子邮件 是另一种方式
exchange of things of that sort, emails, are another way
人们可以在其中连接
in which people can bond.
但注视 发声 情感  触摸才是真正的核心
But gaze, vocalization, affect and touch are really the core
我们称之为社会纽带和情感的东西
of this thing that we call social bonds and emotionality.
现在很重要
Now that's important.
我们知道例如
We know for instance
有像梭形面部一样的大脑区域
that there are brain areas like the fusiform face area
在大脑深处
which is deep in the brain
负责人脸的处理
that is responsible for the processing of faces.
孩子对父母的面孔和声音的认识
Children's recognition of their parents' faces and voices
非常准确和强大
is extremely accurate and strong.
同样 父母可以辨别出孩子的发声
Likewise, parents recognition of their child's vocalizations
不仅是声音 而且哭声也很了不起
not just voices, but cries are remarkable.
如果你曾经有参加聚会的经验
If you've ever had the experience of being at a party
和生小孩的人一起
with somebody who has small children
你在跟他们说话
and you're talking to them,
突然之间 他们听到了一些声音 但你却听不到
and all of a sudden they hear something but you don't,
好像他们听到狼一样
it's as if they've got wolf hearing,
突然之间 他们跑到另一个房间
and all of a sudden, they go running into the other room.
确实 那个孩子就像 我不知道
And indeed the kid is like, I don't know,
一些孩子在殴打他们的孩子
some kid is beating up their kid
或他们的孩子在殴打其他孩子
or their kid's beating up some other kid,
或孩子自己受伤
or the kid injure themselves
或感到精神上的伤害
or feels emotionally injured.
这种对声音的感知
This perception of voices.
有很好的证据
There's very good evidence
支持我们人体被调整到 听到某些
to support the fact that we are tuned
声音的频率
to the frequencies of voices
就是我们关心的人声音频率
and vocalizations of people that we care about.
不仅在啮齿动物中如此
It's not just true in rodents
在鸟类和其他哺乳动物中
and in birds and other mammals,
在人类中也绝对是正确的
it's definitely true in humans as well.
婴儿非常喜欢
And babies are very tuned in
听到他们母亲的声音
to the sound of their mother's voice,
甚至 是的 当他们在子宫里时
even, yes, while they're in the womb.
这就是所谓的“安逸”的整个世界
There's this whole world of what's called mother-ease,
这是妈妈们特别的讲话方式
which is the particular style of speech that mothers
现在我们知道其他监护人可与儿童一起使用
and other caretakers now we know use with children.
因此 这些是核心要素
So those are the core elements.
你如何看某人以及他们如何看你
How you look at somebody and how they look at you,
你在说什么 他们在说什么 他们似乎在感觉什么
what you say, what they say, what they seem to be feeling,
以及如何使你感到微笑 皱眉
and how that makes you feel, smiles, frowns.
如果你真的很了解某人 那么你可以阅读一些曲解
If you know someone really well, you can read inflections,
甚至是一些微妙的东西
like even little subtle things like,
嗯 他们真的不相信我
mm, they don't really believe me,
或者 哦 他们对此感到非常兴奋
or, oh they're really excited by this,
或者 哦 现在我知道他们在想什么
or, oh, now I know what they're thinking.
那样的处理
That kind of processing,
有些人比其他人更擅长
some people are better at it than others,
但是每个人都比较擅长
but everyone's better at doing that
处理我们认识的人的情绪
with people that we recognize and know.
实际上 夫妻之间的这种预测非常融洽
In fact, couples come to know each other exceedingly well,
如此之多 以至于它们可以受益
so much so that it can both benefit
同时也会伤害他们的关系
and injure their relationship
互相不断做出这些预测
to constantly be making these perceptions.
但是有一个范围
But there's a range.
有些人比其他人更喜欢这个
Some people are more tuned into this than others.
那可能有根
And that probably has roots
在你早期形成的各种连接中
in the sorts of attachments that you form early on.
因此Bowlby和同事开发了这些a b c和d东西
So Bowlby and colleagues develop these a, b, c, d thing.
这与人脸处理
And it has a lot to do with face processing
凝视 发声和触摸  有很大关系
and gaze and vocalizations and touch,
所有这些都是在母亲的陪伴下发生的
all of those happen on return with the mother,
但是他们没有解析那些
but they weren't parsing those,
他们并没有单独看他们
they weren't looking at them individually.
因此 这提出了一个非常有趣的问题 那就是
So this raises a really interesting question, which is,
感觉到什么是什么？
what is it when we feel something?
是因为某事
Is it because of something
那是我们自发地发生的 是一种记忆
that happened spontaneously in us, it's a memory,
还是我们意识到的事情 我们在互联网上看到了
or it's something that we realize, we saw on the internet
还是我们有关于某人的消息？
or we got news about somebody?
如今人们获得了很多信息
Nowadays people get so much information
关于他们认识的人
about the people they know,
他们喜欢和不喜欢的人
both the people they like and dislike
通过查看网上的事情
by way of viewing online activities.
所以他们在极端地恐惧
So they're exterocepting,
然后会影响你的内部状态
and then it's impacting your internal state.
很明显
And it's clear
从大多数情绪健康的理论来看
from most all of the theories of emotional health,
在任何时候能够
that an ability to recognize
意识到外部事件
when your own internal state
对自己内心状态的影响
is being driven primarily by external events,
这种能力对于情绪调节有非常重要的作用
as important for being able to emotionally regulate.
人们不断地
People who are constantly
被世界上的外部事件所吸引
being yanked around by the external happenings in the world,
你会说在情感上不稳定
you would say are emotionally labile,
他们无法控制自己的情绪
they are not in control of their emotions,
即使他们一直很平静
even if they're calm all the time,
如果那种平静到来
if that calmness only arrives
因为他们处在平静的环境中
because they're in a placid environment
然后在那个环境里打破什么东西
and then you put a cracker in that environment
他们吓坏了 那么 他们并没有真正平静下来
and they freak out, well, then they're not really calm.
他们到目前为止的平静
Their calm in so far
因为在环境中没有任何干扰
as there isn't something disturbing in the environment.
那么外面的环境多少
So how much the outside environment
破坏你的内部环境
disrupts your internal environment
都是关于
has everything to do
内部感知与外部感知之间的平衡
with this balance of interoception and an exteroception.
而且很可能有根
And it very likely has roots
无论你是否是一个有安全感的人
in whether or not you were secure attached
或没有安全感
or insecure attached,
无规律或矛盾的婴儿
disorganized or ambivalent as a baby.
当然 你不能时光倒流去看自己是怎么样
And of course, you can't travel back in time and know,
但有一些提示
but there are some hints
关于我们每个人都有什么样的情感
as to what kind of emotionality each of us has
通过考察两个发展阶段
by examining two periods of development,
一个是青春期 另一个是成年期
one is adolescence and puberty and the other is adulthood.
因此 尽管我们无法时光倒流
So while we can't travel back in time,
有一种你可以做的实验
there is an exercise that you can do
至少在此刻可以看到
to address at least in this moment,
你是偏向外部感受
whether or not you have a bias for exteroception
还是偏向内部感受
or a bias for interoception,
至少在这个时候你是否
whether or not you are better at least in this moment,
更擅长于在注意
at paying attention
内部或外部发生的情况
to what's going on internally or externally.
当然 这将因情况而异
And of course, this will vary with circumstance.
我想我们都知道人们 也许是你
I think we all know people that, maybe it's you,
你去参加一个聚会 你到达那里
you go to a party and you get there,
每个人似乎都在说话
and everyone seems to be talking
并度过了一段美好的时光
and having a really good time,
而你想知道是否
and you're wondering whether or not
你的牙齿里有食物
you have any food in your teeth
或者你的脸上是否有东西
or whether or not there's something on your face
或者你的头发是否正确
or whether or not your hair is right
或者你是否以错误的方式讲了话
or whether or not you said something the wrong way,
无论你的脸是否变红
whether or not you're turning red.
人们在公开演讲中也会体会到很多
People also experience this a lot with public speaking.
这不仅仅是学习如何控制压力水平
It's not just about learning to clamp your level of stress,
这也与你对自己的感受有多大关系
it's also about how much you're exterocepting,
他们称它有多少让你烦恼
how much you're out of your head, they call it.
但是 你对周围的事件有多大的关注
But how much you're focused on the events around you
与你内心的事件
versus the events inside you.
其实很有趣
Actually, it's interesting
当你与非常有能力的运动员交谈时
when you talk to people who are very effective athletes
或者他们有非常高的压力 高后果的工作
or they have very high stress high consequence jobs,
他们谈论这种摆脱头脑的想法
they talk about this notion of getting out of your head.
你只有那么多的注意力资源
You only have so much attentional resource,
它可以分为两部分
and it can be split between two things,
稍后你会看到的
you'll see that in a moment.
它们可以固定在一件事情上
They can be anchored to one thing.
它可以完全专注于内部发生的事情
It can be fully focused on what's going on internally
或者可以完全专注于外部发生的事情
or it can be fully focused on what's going on externally.
如果你想获得高效  效率
And if you want to be effective in the world,
“高效”用引号引起来
effective being in quotes,
在动态环境中很有用
it is useful when in very dynamic environments,
尤其是社交环境
especially social environments,
让你的注意力集中在外面
to have a lot of your attention focused outward
而不是试图注意
as opposed to trying to pay attention
你说的话是否正确
to whether or not you're saying things correctly
或你自己声音的嘶哑
or the tambour of your own voice,
那或多或少是破坏性的
that is more or less destructive
参与社交的能力
for the ability to engage socially.
所以这是练习
So here's the exercise.
你可以这样做
You can do this.
如果你开车 请不要这样做
Please don't do this if you're driving.
但是 让我们尝试说明一下
But let's just try and illustrate
或允许你
or allow you
体验这种自我感知 外部感知的平衡
to experience this interoceptive, exteroceptive balance,
以及你可以移动的范围
and the extent to which you can move
故意进行套叠和套叠
interoception and exteroception deliberately.
如果你现在闭上眼睛
If you close your eyes right now
专注于身体任何部位的接触
and concentrate on the contact of any portion of your body
说椅子或汽车座椅
with say the chair or your car seat,
虽然请再说一次
although please, again,
开车时不要这样做
don't do this while you're driving,
无论你身在何处
anywhere that you are,
即使你只是站起来或在厨房里
even if you're just standing up or you're in the kitchen,
你躺在沙发上
you're laying on the couch,
并尽力吸引你的注意力
and trying to bring as much of your attention
到那个接触点
to that point of contact as possible.
然后从那里
And then from there,
你将更加深入地转移你的注意力
you're going to move your attention even more deeply
说出你肠内发生的事情的感觉
into say the sensation of what's going on in your gut.
你吃饱了吗？
Are you full?
你是空的吗？
Are you empty?
你饿了吗？
Are you hungry?
你不是吗
Are you not?
你的心脏以什么速度跳动？
Is your heart beating, at what rate?
你的呼吸节奏如何？
What's the cadence of your breathing?
基本上引起你的关注和关注
Basically bringing your focus and attention
覆盖皮肤表面和内在的一切
to everything at the surface of your skin and inward.
因此 我将在Huberman Lab播客上做一件罕见的事情
So I'm going to do a rare thing on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
我将介绍大约五到八秒钟的静音时间
I'm going to introduce about five to eight seconds of silence
为了让你做到这一点
in order to allow you to do that a little bit.
现在这是一个练习
Now this is an exercise
以后你可以继续
that you can continue afterward
如果你想延长执行此操作的时间
if you want to extend how long you do this.
但是现在尝试做些什么
But now try and do something that,
对于大多数人来说实际上要难一些
for most people actually is a little bit harder,
纯粹是为了外在感受
which is to purely exterocept,
戴上眼睛或耳朵 或同时戴上
put your eyes or your ears, or both
在你眼前空间的任何东西上 一件事
on anything in your immediate space, one thing.
我会把那个东西限制在足够小的范围内
And I would restrict that thing to something small enough
至少在你的视野中
that at least in your field of view
它会占据你视野的20％
it would occupy 20% of your field of view.
因此 它不一定是精确的
So it doesn't have to be a pinpoint
除非别针正好在你面前
unless the pin is right in front of you
而且你将它保持得很近
and you're holding it real close.
我会说 看整个房间 在墙上挑选一块面板
I would say, look across the room, pick a panel on the wall
或桌子的腿或其他东西
or a leg of a table or something,
并尝试带来
and try and bring
尽可能多地注意这一点
as much of your attention to that as possible.
再说一遍 我将沉默约五秒钟
And again, I'll take about five seconds of silence
让你exextcept
to allow you to exterocept.
所以你可能发现的是
So what you probably found is that
你能够做到这一点
you were able to do that,
但是一定程度的互感得以维持
but that some degree of interoception is maintained.
很难引起你100％的关注
It's hard to place 100% of your attention
在外部的东西上
on something externally,
除非它真的很刺激 真的很新颖
unless it's really exciting, really novel.
如果你曾经看过一部很棒的电影
If you've ever watched a really great movie,
想必你在外在
presumably you're exterocepting
比你的感受力还强
more than you're interoceptive
直到发生激动人心的事情
until something exciting happens
然后你会感觉到一些
and then you feel something.
你实际上是在网络共享
You're actually tethering
你对外部事物的情感体验
your emotional experience to something external.
现在 你也可以动态地执行此操作
And now you can also do this dynamically.
你可以决定将重点放在内部和外部
You can decide to focus internally and externally.
你可以决定将其拆分为50％ 50％或70/30
You can decide to split it 50%, 50% or 70/30.
你可以增强执行此操作的能力
You can develop a heightened ability to do this.
这样做的力量
And the power of doing that
实际上是当你在环境中时
is actually that when you are in environments
你觉得自己在内部过于专注
where you feel like you're focused too much internally
并且你希望更集中于外部
and you'd like to be focused more externally,
你实际上可以故意这样做
you can actually do that deliberately.
但是如你所知 这需要工作
But as you notice, it takes work,
它涉及到引起你的注意
it involves taking your attentional spotlight,
以及我们所说的你关注的焦点
and what we call the aperture of your attention,
然后将光圈缩小到自我
and narrowing that aperture to either the self
或外部的东西或将两者分开
or something externally or splitting the two.
但是有实践
And yet there are practices
那些以
that have been developed that center on
运动性内感受和外感受
moving interoception and exteroception
从一个比另一个更重
from one being more heavily weighted than the other,
向外更集中
more focused outward
或更专注于内向
or more focused inward.
而且它是动态的
And it's dynamic.
以及大脑中的回路
And the circuits in the brain
是内部和外部感受的基础
that underlie intero and exteroception
尚不完全清楚
aren't exactly known,
但它们锚定在大脑区域
but they are anchored in the areas of the brain
引起注意的
that are involved in attention,
像额眼
like the frontal eye fields
和某些方面 当你是第三人称自己时
and areas that when you third-person yourself,
当你看到自己在做某事时
when you can see yourself doing something,
就像在环境中伸出手一样
like if you put your hand out in your environment
你专注于你的手
and you focus on your hand,
你知道那是你的手
you know that that's your hand
而不是一些随机的对象
as opposed to some random object.
涉及到大脑的某些区域
There are areas of the brain that are involved in that,
在识别自己的位置
in recognizing location of self
相对于身体的其余部分
relative to the rest of your body.
这些练习实际上是核心
These exercises are really what are at the core
这些情感纽带的发展
of these development of emotional bonds.
因为正如我们前面提到的 这四件事
Because as we mentioned before, these four things,
凝视 发声 触摸和影响
the gaze, vocalization, touch and affect,
这些正在非常动态地发生
those are happening very dynamically.
所以 如果有人对你眨眼
So if somebody winks at you,
你正在注意他们的眨眼
you're paying attention to their wink,
但随后你也会注意到自己的感受
but then you also notice how you feel.
然后他们可能会说些什么
Then they might say something,
那么你可能会说些什么 这是非常动态的
then you might say something, this is very dynamic.
因此 如果它似乎势不可挡
So if it seems overwhelming
尝试接受外在感受
to try and interocept an exterocept
然后转移平衡
and then shift the balance,
你一直都这样做
you do that all the time.
你的大脑和神经系统非常擅长这样做
Your brain and nervous system are fantastic at doing this.
现在 有些人很难过
Now, some people have a very hard time
突破非常强烈的互感模式
breaking out of a very strongly interoceptive mode.
有些人很难过
Some people have a harder time
打破他们的外在感受方式
breaking out of their exteroceptive mode.
这是非常有趣的笔记
It's very interesting note
我们有偏见的程度
the extent to which we have biases
在我们的感受力或感受力方面
in how interoceptive or exteroceptive we are.
记住我们之前提到的三个轴
Remember those three axes that we talked about earlier,
你有好有坏的价
you have valence, good or bad,
你有机敏 机敏或冷静
you have alertness, alert or calm,
并且你有感觉上或感觉上的偏见
and you have interoceptive or exteroceptive bias.
这一天会有所不同
And it's going to differ across the day,
在整个生命周期中都会有所不同
it's going to differ across the lifetime.
肯定会有所不同
It's certainly going to differ
根据你从事的是什么
according to whatever it is that you're engaged in.
但是在成长初期
But early in development,
你从这种观念上的偏见开始
you start off with this interoceptive bias.
你开始建立期望 预测
You are starting to develop expectations, predictions
关于外部世界将如何运作的信息
about how the outside world is going to work.
而你正在尝试找出可靠性
And you are trying to figure out the reliability
人们的外部事件
of outside events in people.
在可靠的地方
And where things are reliable,
当人们可靠时
when people are reliable,
我们有能力放弃更多的感知能力
we are able to give up more of our interoception.
从字面上相信我们的互感需求
There's literally trust that our interoceptive needs
我们的内部需求将得到满足
our internal needs will be met
通过他人的纽带和行动
through bonds and actions of others.
这开始转向
This starts to veer toward
关于忽视和创伤的讨论
the discussion about neglect and trauma.
我们将全情投入
We are going to devote entire episodes,
大概整整一个月都受到创伤和创伤后应激障碍的困扰
probably an entire month to trauma and PTSD.
但是这些都植根于我们现在正在谈论的内容
But those have roots in what we're talking about now.
内在化很重要
And it's important to internalize
并了解我们现在在谈论什么
and understand what we're talking about now
为了从未来的对话中获得最大收益
in order to get the most out of those future conversations.
所以 如果这一切看起来像
So if all of this seems like
很多信息 而且非常复杂
a lot of information and very complicated,
我只是邀请你不时注意
I just invite you to pay attention from time to time
你碰巧有多少是在进行内部感知或外部感知
how much you happen to be interocepting or exterocepting,
因为情绪和这些情绪的强度
because emotions and the intensity of those emotions
会增长或收缩
will grow or shrink
取决于我们内在感受的程度
depending on how much we're interocepting.
如果我们感到非常难过
If we are feeling extremely sad,
有一次外部事件使我们感到难过
and there is an outside event that made us sad,
一般来说你会保持平衡
chances are there's going to be a balance,
但是那种极端的悲伤 极端的悲伤
but that the extreme grief, the extreme sadness
会导致我们大部分都感觉不到
is going to lead us to mostly interoceptive.
而当我们感到非常高兴时
Whereas when we're feeling extremely happy,
也是一样
the same is true.
世界上发生了一件大事
Something great happens in the world,
而我们只是会感觉到
and we're just going to feel it.
我们大部分的看法
Most of our perception,
我们大多数的意识将集中在我们的内部状态上
most of our awareness is going to be on our internal state.
所以我们总是被束缚在外面
So we are always tethered to the outside world
在某种程度上
to some degree or another.
当你还是婴儿的时候 是这样
That was true when you were an infant,
青春期时是这样
and it was true when you were an adolescent,
作为成年人 也是
and it's true as an adult.
所以现在我想暂停一下
So now I want to just pause,
只是搁置一下这个讨论
just shelve the discussion
先不提内部感受和外部感受
about interoception, exteroception for a moment.
我想谈一谈
And I want to talk about
如果不是的话 可以说是第二高的是什么
what is arguably the second most, if not,
成长中同样重要的方面
equally important aspect of your development
与情感有关
as it relates to emotionality
与此相关的是我所说的 信任
and as it relates to this, what I call trust,
就是这种预测能力
but this ability to predict
预测外面的世界
whether or not things in the outside world
对于帮助你满足你的感知需求这方面
are reliable or not reliable
是可靠的  还是不可靠的
in terms of their ability
决定这个能力的重要时期
to help you meet your interoceptive needs.
那个时期是青春期
And that period is puberty.
所以直到现在 我们一直主要谈论心理学
So up until now, we've been talking mainly about psychology,
没有很多生物学 没有很多机制
not a lot of biology, not a lot of mechanism.
现在我们要过渡
And now we're going to transition
谈论机制
into talking about mechanism,
激素 受体等
hormones, receptors, et cetera.
青春期绝对是一个生物学事件
Puberty is a absolute biological event.
它有一个开始 并且有一个特定的定义
It has a beginning, and it has a specific definition,
这是向生殖成熟的过渡
which is the transition into reproductive maturity.
因此 荷尔蒙发生了很多变化
So there are a lot of hormonal changes.
是的 大脑也有很多变化
Yes, there are also a lot of brain changes.
而且大多数人都没有意识到
And most people don't realize it,
但首先发生的是脑部变化
but the brain changes occur first.
大脑打开激素系统
The brain turns on the hormone systems
让青春期发生
that allow puberty to occur.
青春期现今
Puberty is occurring earlier nowadays
与过去相比  提前了
than it did in the past.
我能够找到的当前数字
The current numbers that I was able to find
是在女性  女孩中
is that in females and girls,
过渡期始于10岁左右
the transition is starting around age 10,
而男孩则是12岁左右
whereas in boys, it's about age 12,
这将有所不同
that's going to differ
有许多不同的因素
by way of a number of different factors.
这些是平均值
Those are averages.
还取决于你在地球上的哪个地区
So it depends on where you are in the world,
取决于各种各样的事情
depends on all sorts of things.
青春期的主要诱因之一
One of the primary triggers for puberty
实际上是体脂肪
is actually body fat.
很有趣
This is interesting.
肽激素  瘦素 有人称它为肽
The peptide hormone, leptin, some people call it a peptide,
有人称它为荷尔蒙
some people call it a hormone,
但它符合两个定义
but it meets both definitions
取决于你如何看待 它是由脂肪制成的
depending on how you look at it, is made by fat.
瘦素在90年代非常流行
So leptin had a lot of popularity in the '90s,
因为它被发现是由脂肪产生的
because it was discovered as being produced by fat,
并在动物研究中被发现
and it was seen in animal studies
可以促进瘦身
that it could promote leanness.
它实际上与大脑沟通
It actually communicates to the brain
告知它体内脂肪足够代谢
that there's enough body fat in order to allow the metabolic factors
以及告知它需要更多脂肪了
and processes to occur to liberate more fat.
这就是为什么人们经常
This is why people have trouble
感到“减掉最后五磅”非常困难
losing that last five pounds.
这是因为瘦素水平很低
It's because leptin levels are very low.
这实际上是基础
This was actually the basis
作弊餐  重新多吃东西的基础
for the whole cheat day, refeed thing,
这个想法是 如果你一周里的一天吃很多东西
that the idea was if you eat a lot for one day a week
在节食的时候
while dieting hard,
那就是在向大脑发出信号
that you can signal to the brain
告诉它身体有足够的瘦素(继续消耗脂肪吧)
that there's enough leptin.
我不知道那是原因
I don't know if that's the reason
还是作弊餐这个概念
or whether or not the cheat days
给人提供了一些心理上的缓解 可能两者都有
just provided some psychological relief, probably both.
但无论如何 瘦素是由体内脂肪制成的
But in any case, leptin is made by body fat.
当瘦素足够的时候
And when there's enough leptin,
它发出信号触发大脑进入青春期
it signals the brain to trigger puberty.
在90年代中期发表了一篇论文
There was a paper published in the mid '90s
在《科学》 优秀期刊中
in the Journal Science, excellent journal,
表明瘦素可以注射到年轻女性身上
showing that leptin could be injected into younger females
还没有进入青春期的女性
that would not have yet gone into puberty.
瘦素可以加速青春期的产生
And you could accelerate the onset of puberty with leptin.
如此 更多的身体脂肪 青春期就更早了
So more body fat, the earlier puberty, that's true.
瘦素也参与其中
Leptin is also involved
一般在人体中有各种生长作用
in various growth effects in the body generally.
有趣的是 非常肥胖的孩子
And it's interesting, very obese children
不一定会提早进入青春期
don't necessarily undergo puberty earlier.
有时他们确实关于 但他们确实倾向于更大的骨架
Sometimes they do, but they do tend to be larger boned.
他们的骨骼实际上更快地成长
Their bones actually grow more quickly,
而且他们的骨密度更高
and they tend to have higher bone density
因为瘦素也与骨密度有关
because leptin is also involved in bone density.
整个青春期开始
The whole issue of onset of puberty
也有一些非常有趣的社会影响
also has some really interesting social effects.
我要特别强调
And I want to really highlight
这些效应中的大多数 也称为信息素效应
that most of these effects, also called pheromone effects.
记住荷尔蒙
Remember a hormone
是人体某个部位分泌的物质 会传播
is a substance secreted from one area of the body, travels,
并影响身体其他部位的组织和细胞
and impacts tissues and cells elsewhere in the body.
信息素是一种化学物质
A pheromone is a chemical
由一个物种的一个成员释放
that's released by one member of a species
去作用
that goes and acts on
并影响该物种的其他成员
and impacts other members of that species
甚至其他物种
or even other species.
因此 例如 啮齿动物非常擅长
So for instance, rodents are very good
感知尿液
at detecting the urine
以及大型食肉动物的气味标记
and the scent markings of large carnivores
想吃他们的大型肉食动物
that want to eat them.
这就是信息素的相互作用
So that's a pheromone interaction.
它们是否是人类的信息素效应
Whether or not they're pheromonal effects in humans
争议很大
is very debated.
不久前我在Instagram上发表了一篇文章
I did a post on this on Instagram a little while ago
关于人类所报告的某些信息素的影响
about some pheromone effects that were reported in humans.
有几个人来找我
And I had a couple of people come at me saying,
“看 它从未真正在人类中展示过
"Look, it's never really been shown in humans
就没有一个信息素的犁鼻器 ”
that there's a pheromonal vomer,"
所谓的犁鼻器
what's called the vomeronasal organ.
有一种叫做雅各布森的器官
There's something called Jacobson's organ.
这是基本的
It's rudimentary.
有些人有   有些人没有  非常具有争议性
Some people have it, some people don't, very controversial.
所以我想指出
So I want to point out
人类信息素的作用是有争议的
that human pheromone effects are controversial.
虽然我认为有
Although I think there's, in my opinion,
他们有足够的证据
there's ample evidence for them,
月经周期同步
synchronization of menstrual cycles.
许多人报告说
Many people report,
不过也有人说另外一些研究
then people say there's some studies
表明那不是事实
that show that it's not true.
然后有一些数据显示非常令人印象深刻
Then there've been some data showing very impressive
女性伴侣的信息素作用
pheromonal effects of female partners
能够检测到他们重要的其他人的气味
being able to detect the odor of their significant others
在洗了几次的T恤上
on t-shirts that were washed several times.
尽管无法问到味道
So they can't consciously perceive it,
但她们说这闻起来像他们
but they say this one smells like them,
这个闻起来像我的伴侣
this one smells like my partner.
确实 这种准确率真的很高  远远超过偶然
And indeed, the match was way above chance.
因此 确实有微弱的信息素作用
So there does seem to be weak pheromonal effects
至少在我看来 当我查看数据时
at least in my opinion when I look at the data,
但是还需要做更多的工作  看更多研究论文
but much more needs to be done.
因此 更有趣的信息素效应之一
So one of the more interesting pheromone effects
至少在动物模型中会影响青春期
that impacts puberty, at least in animal models
就是所谓的"范登堡效应"
is the so-called Vandenbergh effect, which is,
如果你是青春期前的女性
if you take a pre-pubertal female,
所以是没有性成熟的女性
so a female that has not undergone sexual maturation,
然后介绍一位全新的男性
and you introduce a novel male
那不是父亲或兄弟 不是表兄弟
that is not the father or a brother, not a sibling,
她几乎会立即进入青春期
she will undergo puberty almost immediately.
因此 这确实令人震惊
So this is really striking.
多年
For years,
人们认为这不是在灵长类动物中发生的
this was thought not to occur in primate species,
但去年有一篇论文
but there was a paper published last year
在《当代生物学》 细胞出版社期刊 一本优秀期刊
in Current Biology, Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
显示山魈 一种特殊的灵长类动物
showing that mandrills, a particular type of primate,
他们表现出范登堡效应
they exhibit this Vandenbergh effect.
还有各种各样的其他信息素效应
There are also all sorts of other pheromone effects.
最臭名昭著的一个
There's the most infamous one
被称为布鲁斯效应
is called the Bruce effect,
把一个新的雄性
where the introduction of a novel male
介绍给怀孕的雌性动物  会造成自然流产
to a pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage.
而且这种效果似乎可以防止
And that effect seems to be protected against
只要父亲在场
by the presence of the father.
这种解释
This interpretation of this,
我要特别强调
and I want to really highlight
这些是动物研究
that these are animal studies,
但是这种效应
but the way this works
如果是怀孕的女性
is that if a pregnant female
在让她怀孕的男性的陪伴下
is in the company of the male that impregnated her,
然后她会受到保护
then her young are protected
通过他的气味或他的信息素的存在
by his scent presence or his pheromone presence.
但是如果他走了 出现了一个全新的男性
But if he's gone and a novel male shows up,
她有一种自然流产的趋势
there's a tendency for her to spontaneously miscarry,
从本质上来说 是胎儿的流失
and essentially for the fetus to be lost.
现在 这是否发生在人类中
Now, whether or not this occurs in humans
仍然很有争议 但是
is still very controversial, but nonetheless,
这些信息素的作用存在
these pheromone effects exist.
那个叫做布鲁斯效应
And that one is called the Bruce effect,
以希尔达·布鲁斯（Hilda Bruce）的名字命名
named after Hilda Bruce,
这位科学家发现了它
who is the scientist that discovered it.
一个相关的
The one that's relevant
青春期的讨论是范登堡效应
to the puberty discussion is the Vandenbergh effect,
我在几分钟前提到的
which I mentioned a few minutes ago,
是一位新奇的男性出现
which is a novel male showing up,
必须是具有性能力的男性
has to be a sexually competent male,
所以他必须已经进入青春期
so he has to have already passed through puberty,
他的出现  触发了女性青春期的激活
and his presence triggers activation of puberty
否则
in a female that otherwise
会保持更长时间才进入青春期
would have remained pre-pubertal for longer.
同样 这是否在人类中发生还不清楚
Again, whether or not this happens in humans is unclear.
好吧 当我们考虑青春期时 我们能确定什么呢？
Well, what can we be sure about when we think about puberty?
青春期是由许多不同的因素触发的
Puberty is triggered by a number of different factors.
大脑中GABA表达有变化
There are changes in GABA expression in the brain,
抑制性递质
an inhibitory transmitter.
一种更有趣的分子
One of the more interesting molecules
触发所有个体的青春期
that triggers puberty in all individuals
是一种叫做kisseptin的东西
is something called kisspeptin,
KISSPEPTIN
亲和素  K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N,
Kisspeptin是由大脑制造的
Kisspeptin is made by the brain.
它刺激
And it stimulates
大量的所有不同激素
large amounts of all different hormone
称为GnRH 促性腺激素释放激素  让它释放
called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone to be released.
促性腺激素释放激素
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
然后导致另一种激素的释放
then causes the release of another hormone
称为黄体生成素或LH
called luteinizing hormone or LH,
在血液中传播
which travels in the bloodstream
并刺激女性的卵巢产生雌激素
and stimulates the ovaries of females to produce estrogen
男性的睾丸产生睾丸激素
and the testes of males to produce testosterone.
Kisspeptin也具有其他作用
Kisspeptin has other effects as well.
但是那些是一些主要的
But those are some of the main ones
与青春期有关
as they relate to puberty.
这很有趣 因为在这个时候上
This is interesting, because at this point,
男性睾丸
the testes in males
开始大量生产睾丸激素
start churning out tons of testosterone
为了触发
in order to trigger
第二性特征的发展
the development of secondary sexual characteristics,
体毛和其他所有东西 声音的加深等等
body hair and all the others, deepening of voice, et cetera.
在女性中 雌激素还在做其他各种事情
And in females, estrogen is doing various other things,
乳房发育等等
breast development, et cetera.
通常 在成年人中
Normally, in an adult,
已经过青春期的人
somebody who has passed puberty,
促性腺激素释放激素大大增加
a big increase in gonadotropin releasing hormone
黄体激素最终将被关闭
and luteinizing hormone would eventually be shut down,
因为大脑的运作方式
because the way that the brain works,
下丘脑和垂体
the hypothalamus and the pituitary
实际上是在测量血液中的激素含量
are actually measuring how much hormone is in the blood.
如果是睾丸激素或雌激素
And if testosterone or estrogen
或其他荷尔蒙过高
or any other hormone goes too high,
他们关闭了
they shut down
释放诸如促黄体激素之类的东西
the release of things like luteinizing hormone.
这称为负反馈回路
It's called a negative feedback loop.
基本上就像房子里的恒温器
Basically is like a thermostat in the house.
比这还复杂的多
It's more complicated than that,
但是一旦血液中的血脂水平过高
but once levels get too high in the blood stream,
它关闭
it shuts down.
但是kisseptin能够驱动
But kisspeptin is able to drive
这些激素的水平很高
very high levels of these hormones in an ongoing way
这样青春期就可以开始并可以继续
so that puberty can commence and can continue.
顺便说一句 kisseptin现在已经成为
And incidentally, kisspeptin has now become
荷尔蒙泛滥
yet another of the panoply of hormones
以及运动员服用的多肽和某些混合物
and peptides and cocktails that athletes take
为了尝试刺激自然激素的产生
in order to try and stimulate natural hormone production,
本质上是为了创造自己的
essentially to create their own
内源性提高性能的激素
performance-enhancing drugs endogenously.
没有评判什么 但这是事实
No judgment there, but that's a fact,
有很多人在用亲肽素
there's a lot of kisspeptin used.
我真的不建议任何人这样做
I truly not suggesting anyone do this,
但是人们正在购买和注射kisepteptin
but people are buying and injecting kisspeptin
出于特定原因 即使是青春期
for the specific reason that even past puberty
可以刺激雌激素等物质的大量增加
can stimulate the large increases in things like estrogen,
睾丸激素和类似物的大量增加
large increases in testosterone and things of that sort.
也有很多心理上的影响
Has a number of psychological effects too,
似乎对性欲等有很大的影响
seems to have big effects on libido, et cetera.
当然 所有这些事情都会受到反馈循环的影响
All these things of course are subject to feedback loops,
因此它们不会无限地增加
so they don't work indefinitely.
我要强调的是
And I'm going to highlight,
再一次 我不建议任何人这样做
again, I'm not suggesting anyone do it,
但我确实想注意那里发生的事情
but I do like to pay attention to what's out there.
还有Kisspeptin 因为那是在很久以前才发现的
And kisspeptin, because it wasn't discovered that long ago
你不常听到的一件事
is one of the things that you don't often hear about
当人们谈论提高表现能力的药物时
when people talk about performance-enhancing drugs
或治疗性内分泌学
or therapeutic endocrinology.
这些东西也有治疗用途
These things also have therapeutic uses
在内分泌环境中
in the endocrine setting.
例如 没有青春期的孩子
So for instance, kids that don't undergo puberty
或性腺功能减退的孩子或性腺功能减退的成年人
or kids that are hypogonadal or adults that are hypogonadal,
他们没有制造足够的激素
they're not making enough hormone
除其他事项外 还将使用kisspeptin之类的东西
will take things like kisspeptin among other things.
这就是青春期在生物学层面上发生的方式
So that's how puberty happens at the biological level,
被瘦素和kisseptin触发
gets triggered by leptin and kisspeptin.
然后这个小孩
And then this young child
现在在某种程度上是另一种生物
is now a different creature to to some extent,
不只是因为
not just because
他们开始有生殖能力
they're reproductively competent, of course,
但是因为其他方面也有转变
but because there's a shift
在这些社会纽带背后的许多事物中
in a number of the things that underlie these social bonds,
发生了转变
there's a market shift
在许多事情上
in a number of the things
让儿童和成人
that allow children and adults
参与有关彼此的预测行为
to engage in predictive behavior about each other.
青春期的整体性质
And the whole nature of adolescence and puberty
是让一个通才的孩子
is to take a child that was a generalist
并使其成为专家
and to make them a specialist.
这很重要
And this is very important
因为它与关于情感的对话有关
as it relates to the conversation about emotionality.
但这在脑功能方面很重要
But it's important in terms of aspects of brain function
在学习方面
and in terms of learning
就我们每一个人而言
and in terms of who each and every one of us
之后会变成什么
will and has become.
在青少年时期
In adolescents and in childhood,
当然 有一些遗传偏向
sure, there are some genetic biases,
头发的颜色 眼睛的颜色 身高等等
hair color, eye color, height, and things like that.
其中很多已被写进基因组中
A lot of that's programmed into the genome.
当然 还有其他我们继承的遗传偏向
There are other genetic biases too of course, that we inherit.
但这是青春期
But it's in adolescents in puberty
从本质上讲
that we go from essentially
本来擅长于很多事情
being somewhat good at a bunch of things
或在很多事情上都比较差
or somewhat poor at a bunch of things,
开始变得  在某些方面非常擅长
to be coming very good at a few things
或者在某些事情上很差
and very poor at a lot of other things.
那是因为
And that's because
与青春期和神经可塑性的关系
of the relationship to puberty and neuroplasticity,
这种改变大脑以响应经验的能力
this ability to change the brain in response to experience
开始逐渐减少 以至于我们20多岁时
is starting to taper off such that by our early 20s,
可塑性变得很难实现
it's harder to achieve.
现在 从通才到专家的过渡
Now, the transition from generalist to specialist
是青春期的一个方面
is one aspect of adolescence and puberty,
但另一个是形成
but the other is the formation
社会和情感纽带
of social and emotional bonds.
而且大部分消耗思想的东西
And most of what consumes the minds
和青少年的醒来时间
and waking hours of adolescents
和青春期的孩子
and children who have gone through puberty
并经历青春期
and going through puberty
是关于他们与社会结构的关系如何的问题
is questions about how they relate to social structures,
他们可以依靠的人
who they can rely on,
以及他们如何做出可靠的预测
and how they can make reliable predictions in the world,
现在他们有更多的部分
now that they have more agency
他们在生理上被改变了
that they are physically changed.
实际上 你可以争论
In fact, you could argue
青春期是最快的成熟阶段
that puberty is the fastest rate of maturation
在整段生命中最快的
that you'll go through at any point in your life.
这是你将生命经历中的最大变化
It's the largest change that you'll go through
关于“你是谁”
at any point in your life in terms of who you are,
因为你的生物学从根本上改变了
because your biology has fundamentally changed
在你的大脑和身体器官的水平
at the level of your brain and your bodily organs,
你所有的器官  皮肤内的
all your organs from the skin inward.
所以我想引用一点研究
So I want to visit a little bit of the research
关于一些核心需求
about some of the core needs that occurred
发生在青春期
during puberty and adolescence,
不只是为了父母
not just for parents
或对于可能正处于青春期的人
or for the people that might be in puberty and adolescence,
而且还可以使他们知道
but also so that people can reflect
当他们接近情感成熟时
on which of the sort of boxes were checked off for them
自己究竟选中了哪种类型的盒子(发展类型)
as they approached emotional maturity.
所以有一篇很棒的评论文章
So there's a terrific review article
发表在《自然》杂志上
that was published in the journal Nature, which is,
如果不是最好
if not the premier,
那也肯定是科学领域前三名顶级期刊之一
then certainly among the top three premier journals
关于青春期的生物学
about the biology of adolescence and puberty,
以及一些核心需求
as well as some of the core needs and demands
必须满足的
that have to be met
才能成功地进行情绪成熟
for successful emotional maturation during that time.
我们将提供一个链接
We will provide a link to that,
但我只想强调
but I just want to highlight
他们放入最终结果的一些事情
a few of the things that they place in the final table.
我现在不想直接说出所有结果
I don't want to go through all the results right now,
因为如果你愿意 你可以自己去看看
because you could do that on your own if you like.
他们主要强调
They mainly highlight
神经元和神经回路的许多变化
a lot of the changes in neurons and neural circuits.
例如 我只强调一个
For instance, I'll just highlight one,
在大脑
there's a connection
在大脑中的多巴胺中心
between the dopamine centers in the brain
和大脑区域​​之间有一个连接
and an area of the brain
涉及情感和分散
that's involved in emotion and dispersal.
分散非常有趣
Dispersal is very interesting.
你可以在动物和人类中观察到
What you observe in animals and humans
是在青春期末
is that around the end of adolescence
在向青春期过渡的过程中
and during the transition to puberty,
都是因为大脑的变化和激素的变化
both because of changes in the brain and changes in hormones
孩子有强烈的欲望
there's an intense desire on the part of the child
与亲密照顾人保持越来越远的距离
to get further and further away from primary caregivers,
他们不是永久地远离  他们总会回来
not permanently, they always return,
类似于一个走开的孩子
similar to a child that walks off
然后回头看看一切是否安全
and then looks back and sees if everything's safe
然后继续向前走
and then continues on.
在青春期
During adolescence and puberty,
无论是在动物还是在儿童中
both in animals and in kids,
似乎在采取行动上存在偏见
it almost seems like there's a bias for action,
和动作
and the action
始终远离主要护理者
is always in a direction away from the primary caregiver.
现在 我一说完 就可以想像
Now, as soon as I say that, I can just imagine in my mind
那边有人说
that somebody out there saying,
“没有啊 我的孩子一进入青春期
"Well, no, my kid as soon as they hit puberty,
他只是想一直和我们在一起”
they just want to stay home with us all the time."
这不是典型的
That's not typical.
有这种情况 但这不是典型的
It happens, but it's not typical.
通常有一种欲望
Mostly there's a desire
开始花更多的时间和朋友在一起
to start spending more time with friends,
与同伴在一起的时间更多 与成年人在一起的时间更少
more time with peers and less time with adults.
我觉得这非常有趣
And I find it extremely interesting
要注意的是 这不仅在人类中是正确的
to note that that's not just true in humans,
在其他灵长类动物中也是如此
that's true in other primate species.
在啮齿动物中确实如此
That's true in rodents.
几乎所有其他哺乳动物物种都是如此
That's true in almost every other mammalian species.
所以这些激素中有些物质
So there's something about these hormones
不仅让人产生有性生殖能力
that don't just allow sexual reproduction.
它们不只是改变大脑
They don't just change the brain
身体器官和我们的身体
and bodily organs and the shape of us,
它们也使我们偏向分散
they also bias us towards dispersal,
开始离开
getting further and further away
特别是亲密照顾者
from primary caregivers in particular.
因此 青少年的父母或未来的青少年
So parents of teenagers or future teenagers,
这不只是正常的
it is not just normal,
它是被植入进了人类的生物学
it is baked in to the biology of humans
在青少年和青少年时期就是会“分散”
to disperse around adolescents and in the teen years.
再说一遍 我只想强调其中的一些
So again, I just want to highlight a few of these,
文章所说的内容
what were listed
作为干预策略
as intervention strategies
促进健康的青春期
to promote healthy adolescence and puberty.
这很有趣 因为整篇文章
It's very interesting because the entire article,
哎呀  我应该提一下是谁写这篇文章 很抱歉
I should mention who wrote this article, apologies.
其中之一是我的一个朋友
One of them is a friend of mine.
所以第一作者是罗纳德·达尔
So the first author is Ronald Dahl,
不是儿童读物的作者
not the children's book author, I'm assuming,
是来自公共卫生学院
no, from the School of Public Health
在加州大学伯克利分校
at University of California, Berkeley
和尼古拉斯·艾伦  琳达·威尔伯特
and Nicholas Allen, Linda Wilbert
还有Anna Balanoff Suliman
and Anna Balanoff Suliman,
原谅我最后一个的发音
forgive me for the pronunciation of the last one.
我跟威尔伯特博士很熟
I know Dr. Wilbert quite well.
她已经完成了分散工作
She's done the work on dispersal,
以这项工作而闻名
is quite well known for that work,
这是一个非常广泛的评论
and it's a very extensive review,
但你可以搜到这篇文章
but I think you'll find it accessible.
大脑的许多变化和厚度
A lot of changes and thickness of the brain
在不同的阶段等等
at different stages, et cetera.
但是我认为大多数人会感兴趣
But I think most people will be interested
在现实世界中的意义是什么
in what that translates to in the real world.
有趣的是在青春期
And what's interesting is during puberty,
越来越多的联系
there's increased connection,
所谓的前额叶皮层之间的连通性
connectivity as we call it between the prefrontal cortex,
涉及动机和决策
which is involved in motivation and decision-making,
能够抑制行动
being able to suppress action
为了实现长期目标
for making long-term goals possible,
以及多巴胺中心​​和杏仁核
as well as dopamine centers and the amygdala.
因此 存在真正的广泛集成和测试
So there's this really broad integration and testing.
我认为这是关键要素
I think this is the key element here,
测试情绪和奖励回路
testing of circuits for emotions and reward
与决策有关
as they relate to decisions.
我认为这很有用 因为
And I think that's useful because
当你观察青少年的行为时
when you look at the behavior of adolescents and teens,
他们正在测试社交互动
they are testing social interactions,
他们正在测试与世界的物理互动
they are testing physical interactions with the world.
通常 他们会从事不安全的行为
Oftentimes they're engaging in unsafe behavior.
我永远不会试图证明这一点
I would never try and justify that
与潜在的神经病学
with the underlying neurology,
但神经科学指出连通性增强
but the neuroscience points to increased connectivity
与情绪有关的大脑区域之间
between areas of the brain that are related to emotionality
并能像扁桃体一样进行威胁检测 而且还能获得回报
and to threat detection like the amygdala, but also reward.
所以这是进行行为测试的时候
So it's a time of testing behaviorally
不同的行为如何导致成功与否
how different behaviors lead to success or not.
这就是不同的行为导致恐惧状态或不恐惧状态的方式
It's how different behaviors lead to fear states or not.
现在 你当然可以说
Now, of course you could say that
在任何发展阶段
of any stage of development,
但似乎青春期是一个非常非常高的阶段
but it seems like puberty is a very, very heightened stage
在测试意外情况时
in which testing of contingencies,
好事或坏事都在发生
good or bad is taking place.
当然 它在人体中运作
And of course it's operating in a body
现在比婴儿更胜任
that's now more capable than the infant.
因此 婴儿可能会因错误而伤害自己
So an infant can damage themselves through error,
但他们很难伤害自己
but it's harder for them to damage themselves
通过深思熟虑的计划
through deliberate planning.
这就是为什么很重要的原因
That's why it's important of course,
把家里所有的药都锁起来
to lock up all the medications in the house,
确保婴儿不能接近他们
make sure infants can't get to them,
但婴儿不太可能
but it's not likely that the infant
会去制定一个极具破坏性的计划
is going to devise an extremely diabolical plan
进入橱柜获取某种物质
to get into the cabinet to get a certain substance.
而一个少年可能会这么做  对吧
Whereas a teenager might.
这样你就可以开始组合这些神经科学
So you can start to map the neurology
进行一些这样的情感探索
onto some of this emotional exploration.
我确实意识到这一集与情感有关
I do realize that this episode is about emotions.
青春期是一生中
Puberty is a time in which
人或动物的内部状态
the internal state of the person or the animal
被采样和测试
is being sampled and tested against
不同的外在感受事件
different exteroceptive events,
只有现在他们能够
only now they are able
更加有条理地计划那些事件
to guide those events with more agency.
不再只是照顾者是否
It's no longer just about whether or not the caregiver
带给你牛奶或带给你食物
is bringing you milk or bringing you food.
现在 当然 父母都会说：
Now, of course, the parents will all say,
“是的 但是我要为他们所做的一切买单
"Yeah, but I'm paying for everything that they're doing.
我要买车 我要买食物”
I'm paying for the car and I'm paying for the food."
啊 是的
Ah, true.
但是生物学并不关心来源
But the biology doesn't care about the source,
现在孩子或青少年能够
the child or the adolescent is now able,
那个少年真的 现在可以采样
the teen really, is able to now sample
通过行为产生更多 更多的外部感受性事件
many, many more exteroceptive events through behavior.
因此 其中一些建议很有趣
So some of these recommendations are interesting.
理论是 动机之一
The theory is that one of the motivations
是学会减轻饥荒和营养不良的风险
is to learn to mitigate the risk of famine and malnutrition.
随着青少年年龄的增长 他们开始质疑
As teenagers get older, they start questioning
不管他们的父母
whether or not their parents
青少年曾经以为的父母
are everything they thought they were,
他们是否是最好的事情
whether or not they're the greatest thing that ever was
或有史以来最糟糕的事情
or the worst thing that ever was, perhaps.
包括
Including whether or not
他们是否将能够为他们提供资源
they will be able to provide them resources.
所以他们测试
So they test whether or not
他们是否可以喂饱自己
they can actually feed themselves,
他们是否可以养活自己
whether or not they can support themselves.
虽然很少
Although rarely not,
当然会发生
certainly it happens,
但是他们很少能真正照顾好自己
but rarely are they really taking care of themselves.
虽然有些青少年被迫照顾自己
Although some teens are forced to take care of themselves
当然是因为父母
of course, because parents
和其他看护人不在身边
and other caretakers aren't available.
针对生物学的建议包括：
The recommendations that map to the biology include,
在以后的开学时间里有很大的推动力
there's been a big push for later start times in schools
适应他们的昼夜节律变化
to match their shifts in circadian rhythms
以及需要长时间睡眠
and the need for extended sleep.
我们在睡眠期间谈论的话题
Something we talked about during the sleep episodes.
坚持对年轻人进行睡眠干预
To insist on sleep interventions for youth
那些面临着精神健康问题的风险增加的年轻人
who are at increased risk for mental health problems.
几乎所有的心理健康问题都是
Almost every mental health issue is supported
通过获得足够长的正常质量的睡眠
by getting regular quality sleep of sufficient duration.
而正常质量的睡眠将因人而异
Sufficient duration is going to vary from person to person.
利用各种社会关系
Leveraging different kinds of social relationships
加强积极的行为
that reinforce positive behavior.
这开始听起来像是样板的东西
This is starting to sound like kind of a boiler plate stuff.
然而 真正的目标是在青春期
And yet, really the goal is during puberty
鼓励尽可能多的安全互动形式
to encourage as many safe forms of interaction
让儿童 青少年 
that allow children, teens, really and adolescents,
我一直称他们为孩子
I keep calling them children,
但是我的意思是孩子要进入青春期
but what I mean are children going through puberty,
让他们测试这种自主权
that allow them to test this thing of autonomy
这样他们就可以开始进行良好的评估
so that they can start to make good assessments
关于他们选择的外在感受性事件的信息
about their exteroceptive events that they are selecting
以及这些因素如何使他们产生内部感觉
and how those make them feel internally.
因此 他们本质上是在做“自助餐”
So they're essentially doing a buffet.
“自助餐”现已扩大
The buffet has now broadened
不仅包括事件和经历
to not just include the events and experiences
他们的父母和其他看护人带来他们
that their parents and other caretakers bring them,
但是他们现在可以扩展“自助餐”了
but they can now expand the buffet
他们可以提供自己的东西
into things that they can provide themselves.
青春期
And so adolescence and puberty
确实被视为发展时期
is really seen as the period of development
其中一个针对这两个元素的自我抽样
in which one self-samples for these two elements
我们一开始所谈论的是
that we talked about at the beginning, which are,
我如何形成纽带  以及  我如何做出预测
how do I form bonds and how do I make predictions
关于什么会让我感觉很好
about what will make me feel good
在内在感知水平上
at a level of interoception.
其中有些听起来有点官方
Some of that might sound a little transactional,
我们正在尝试做的一切
that all we're trying to do
弄清楚我们如何与人建立联系
is figure out how we can bond with people
这样我们就可以得到我们需要的东西 这样我们就可以感觉到我们需要什么
so we can get what we need so we can feel how we need.
我认为在某种程度上是对的
I think that's true to some extent,
当然 有更丰富的
of course, there's a richer,
关系更抽象的方面是
more abstract aspect to relationships too, which are,
在关系中 你可以涉猎
in relationships you can access
你以前无法做的事情 你可以合作
things you couldn't do before, you can cooperate.
有团队合作之类的东西
There's things like teamwork.
你可以做各种各样的事情
You can do all sorts of things.
但是就生物学而言
But in terms of the biology,
显然 有一个发展阶段
it's clear that there's this stage of development
有更多的自主权
where more autonomy,
更多的身体能力
more physical capability
是由大脑中这些激素的变化触发的
is triggered by these hormone changes in the brain,
这些肽会在大脑和身体中发生变化
and these peptide changes in the brain and body.
尽管如此
And that nonetheless
带我们回到完全相同的模型
brings us back to the exact same model
我们从婴儿期开始
that we started with in infancy,
保持警觉或镇定 感到好或不好
of alert or calm, feel good or feel bad,
主要是外在感受 主要是内在感受
primarily exterocepting, primarily interocepting.
所以我继续回到这一点
So I keep going back to this,
我有点像重复记录
I'm sort of like a repeating record on that,
因为相同的核心算法
because the same core algorithm,
在整个生命周期中 相同的核心功能都在发挥作用
the same core function is at play throughout the lifespan.
我认为这是一个有用的框架
And that's a useful framework in my opinion,
因为它允许你对所有数据进行排序
because it allows you to sort through all the data
和处理外部的信息
and information that's out there about,
好吧 这个区域是活跃的
well, this area, the astria terminalis is active
或基底外侧杏仁核活跃
or the basal lateral amygdala is active
或灰质增厚
or gray matter thickening
或这种激素或那种激素
or this hormone or that hormone,
回到一种内核
and return to a kind of kernel
当然不是详尽无遗的真理
of certainly not exhaustive truth,
它并没有涵盖情感的所有方面
it doesn't cover all aspects of emotionality,
但至少建立了一些基础
but at least establishes some groundwork
从中你可以开始评估
from which you can start to evaluate
不同的行为可能有意义或不合理
how different behaviors might or might not make sense,
某些情绪反应
how certain emotional responses
是否有意义
might or might not make sense,
不论人或生物的年龄
regardless of the age of the person or the organism.
关于情绪的讨论
A discussion about emotions would not be complete
要是不谈右脑 左脑  将是不完整的
without talking about the right brain, left brain stuff.
这是社会学  心理学和神经科学
And this is a very interesting aspect of sociology,
一个非常有趣的方面
psychology and neuroscience.
有一种情感发展理论
There's a theory of emotional development
我觉得特别有趣
that I find particularly interesting,
来自加州大学洛杉矶分校的艾伦·舒尔（Allan Schore）
which is from Allan Schore at UCLA,
谈论
that talks about
我们大多数对纽带和关系的测试
how most of our testing of bonds and relationships
是在非常多巴胺能之间来回摆动吗？
is this seesawing back and forth between very dopaminergic,
被多巴胺驱动
so driven by dopamine
或5-羟色胺能 由5-羟色胺状态驱动
or serotonergic, driven by serotonin states.
这始于婴儿和母亲或婴儿和父亲
And this starts with infant and mother or infant and father.
我在上一集中谈到了这一点
I talked a little bit about this in the previous episode,
只是提醒你
but just to remind you,
或对于那些没有听说过的人
or for anyone that didn't hear about it,
在成长过程中
that during development,
健康的情绪发展
healthy emotional development
显然始于照顾者和孩子的能力
clearly begins with an ability for the caretaker and child
保持镇定 和平 舒缓 以触摸为导向
to be in calm, peaceful, soothing, touch-oriented,
融入对视的行为类型
eye gazing type of behaviors.
那些真正驱动5-羟色胺（内源性阿片系统）的人
Those really drive serotonin, the endogenous opioid system,
催产素 情况很平静
oxytocin, things are very calming
并以当下 现在为中心
and are centered around pleasure with the here and now,
以及接下来要做什么的兴奋状态
as well as excited states of what we're going to do next.
实际上有一个特征性的标志
There's actually a characteristic sign
多巴胺能相互作用
of the dopaminergic interaction,
看护人和孩子都睁大眼睛的地方
where both caretaker and child are wide-eyed,
瞳孔扩大
the pupils dilate.
这是唤醒的标志
That's a signature of arousal.
他们真的很兴奋
They get really excited.
通常 如果宝宝真的很兴奋 他会把目光移开
Oftentimes the baby will look away if it gets really excited
这些是体内多巴胺释放的标志
those are signatures of dopamine release in the body,
在青少年时期 同样的事情会继续
and in adolescents, these same things carry forward,
他们的良好纽带
where their good bonds
是通过一起出去玩 看电视
are achieved through hanging around, watching TV,
玩电子游戏
playing video games
或一起发短信或交谈
or texting together or talking,
不管是什么
whatever it is
令人放松的当地活动恰好是
that the soothing local activity happens to be,
以及冒险和令人兴奋的事情
as well as adventure and things that are exciting,
所以可能是体育运动 可能是购物
so it could be sports, it could be shopping,
这可能是夏天的冒险
it could be a summer adventure.
可能是下一件大事
It could be the next big thing.
所以这种来回锯切
And so this kind of seesawing back and forth
在不同的奖励制度之间似乎是基础
between the different reward systems seems to be the basis
从中才能建立健康的情感纽带
from which healthy emotional bonds are created.
我邀请任何对此感兴趣的人
And I invite anyone who's interested in this
去看一些Schore博士的一些论文
to look up some of Dr. Schore's work.
我想我在最后一集里弄错了
I think I misspoke on the last episode.
他不是精神科医生
He's not a psychiatrist,
他是一名临床心理学家和心理分析师
he's a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst,
但是在神经科学领域有着很深的发展
but has deep routings in neuroscience.
因此 我认为这非常棒
So I think a fascinating aspect.
但他书中的构架方式
But the way it's framed in his book
并用某些语言
and in some of the language
围绕右脑 左脑
around right brain, left brain.
而且我们之前都听说过这些东西
And we've all heard this stuff before,
认为右脑是情感方面
that the right brain is thought to be the emotional side.
这是你在那里听到的典型事物
This is the characteristic thing that you hear out there.
右脑是整体的
That the right brain is holistic,
是充满动力的
that it's emotive,
并且左脑是逻辑的 顺序的和分析性的
and that the left brain is logical, sequential and analytic.
而那不是Schore的提议
And that's not what Schore was proposing.
左右脑是有一些有差异
There are some right brain, left brain differences.
但是右脑的想法
But the idea that the right brain
是综合的 整体的和情感的
is synthetic, holistic and emotive,
那左脑
and that the left brain
是逻辑 顺序和分析是错误的
is logical, sequential and analytic is false.
对此 神经科学证据为零
There is zero neuroscience evidence for that whatsoever.
我们将更详细地解决这个问题
We're going to address this in more detail
在一个月内谈论学习
during a month talking about learning
记忆力和痴呆症
and memory and dementia,
但让我们谈谈一些事实
but let's talk about some truths,
左脑和右脑之间确实有的一些差异
some differences between the left brain and right brain,
因为如果不这样做
because we can't have a discussion about emotion
我们无法讨论情感
without doing that.
左脑 至少适用于惯用右手的人
The left brain, at least for people who are right-handed
在语言上占主导地位
is linguistically dominant.
意义 大部分语言
Meaning, most of language
位于大脑左侧
is centered in the left side of the brain
对于惯用右手的人
for right-handed people.
如果你是左撇子
If you are a left-hander
而你被迫成为右撇子
and you were forced to become right-handed,
大概率是情况仍然如此
chances are this is still true,
因为语言就是在大脑中那个部位
because of when language gets laid down in the brain.
对于左撇子
For left-handers,
用左手自然写字的人
people that naturally write with their left hand
一直都这样
and always did,
语言仍然主要位于大脑的左侧
language is still mostly in the left side of the brain,
但也经常发现
but it's also found more often
在大脑的右侧也有语言
in the right side of the brain.
所以它不像我们所说的偏侧化
So it's not as lateralized as we say,
这是两者之间的一种分布
it's kind of distributed between both.
因此 惯用右手的人
So right-handers,
你大部分的语言
most of your language
是从大脑的左侧来的
is coming from the left side of your brain.
左撇子 可能是
Left-handers, it's probably
分布更均匀
a little bit more evenly distributed.
还有一些变化
And there are some variations,
不管你是右撇子还是左撇子
whether or not you're a hook righty or a hook lefty,
有各种各样的细微差别
there's all sorts of nuance to this,
但这说的是一般情况
but that's the general aspect.
所以语言倾向于居中
So language tends to be centered
在大脑的左侧
in the left side of the brain.
其中包括词汇 语法 语义
And that includes lexicon, grammar, syntax,
所有的 除了一个
all of it, except for one.
我们将讨论语言的一个方面
And we'll talk about one aspect of language
似乎更像是右脑
that seems to be more right brain.
那很有趣
That's very interesting.
似乎确实有一些算术上的优势
There does seem to be some arithmetic advantage.
因此 数学能力在大脑的左侧
So ability in math in the left side of the brain.
我将要谈论
And I'm going to talk about
如何发现这些的  马上会讲
how all this was discovered in a minute.
而右脑在语言上是原始的
And the right brain, however, is linguistically primitive.
大多数人没有意识到这一点
Most people don't realize this
因为右脑总是被描述
because the right brain is always described
作为情感方面
as the emotive side,
这是超级感性的和整体的
it's super emotional and holistic,
但实际上在语言上是原始的
but it's actually linguistically primitive.
有一种方法
And there's a way
通过实验已经弄清楚了
that that's been teased out through experiment.
擅长处理空间事物
It's very good at manipulating spatial things
和视觉空间任务
and visual spatial tasks.
主要是处理这些东西
It's primarily handling that stuff,
但是除了一个方面 它是一种非语言
but it sort of non-language except one aspect.
而且没有足够的证据证明这一点
And there isn't a ton of evidence for this,
但有力的证据 这是韵律
but the evidence is strong, which is prosody.
韵律是语言的起伏
Prosody is the LILting and falling of language.
因此 意大利就是一个很好的例子
So a good example would be Italian.
我不会说意大利语
I don't speak Italian.
我只懂一点意大利语
I only know a little bit of Italian,
但我知道的大多数意大利人
but the most of the Italian I know
我的意大利同事对我说
is when my Italian colleagues have said to me,
[意大利语]
[speaks in foreign language],
意思是说“你想说什么”
which means like what are you trying to say,
“你在说什么？”
what are you saying?
我想我说的是对的
I think I'm getting that right.
基本上他们是说我不会说意大利语
Basically they're saying I don't speak Italian,
没错
which is true.
或者他们之中有一个人知道我非常喜欢Costello
Or because one of them knows I loves Costello very much,
他们总是说[意大利语]
they always say [speaks in foreign language],
意思是巨型 懒惰的狗
which means big, lazy guy,
准确地概括了Costello的特色
which accurately captures Costello.
所以即使是那几个例子
So even those few examples,
[意大利语]
[speaks in foreign language],
有很多起伏在
there's a lot of LILt and fall in Italian,
其他语言 不是很多
other languages, not so much.
而且它因语言而异
And it varies by language.
我觉得意大利语如此美丽的原因之一
One of the reasons I find Italian so beautiful,
不是我说的意大利语
not the Italian I speak,
但是其他人说的意大利语
but the Italian that other people speak
太好听了
so beautiful to listen to
就是因为那个韵律
that that prosody
语调的变化确实非常显着
and the shifts in intonation are really quite remarkable.
几乎就像一首歌
It's almost like a singing song
听他们说话
listening to them speak.
我以前喜欢参加科学会议
And I used to like to go to scientific meetings.
而且我总是和意大利人闲逛
And I always hang out with the Italians,
因为我在意大利的实验室里有一些好朋友
'cause I had some good friends in Italian labs,
而且因为他们总是知道最好的食物在哪里
but also 'cause they always knew where the best food was,
他们的美食要求令人难以置信
their standards for food are incredible.
他们宁愿饿死也不愿吃可怕的意大利面
They would rather starve than eat terrible pasta,
和他们发现的面食
and the pasta they do find
他们愿意吃东西总是很棒的
and that they're willing to eat is always fantastic.
但是除此之外 他们总是带来了吉他
But in addition to that, they always brought a guitar.
他们好玩多了
They were a lot more fun
比我很多其他同事
than a lot of my other colleagues
在会议上闲逛
to hang out with at meetings.
所以无论如何
So in any event,
右脑在做事
the right brain is doing things
更多关于操纵空间信息
that are more about manipulating spatial information.
我将在以后的播客中进一步讨论这一点
And I'll talk about this more in a future episode.
这是在裂脑患者中发现的
This was discovered in split-brain patients,
在大脑的两侧之间
the people that lack connection
缺乏联系的人
between the two sides of the brain,
这必须介绍一个
this had to be teased out
通过非常复杂的实验
through very complicated experiments.
像Roger Sperry这样的人因此获得了诺贝尔奖
People like Roger Sperry who won a Nobel Prize for this,
曾在加州理工学院
who was at Caltech,
迈克·加扎尼加（Mike Gazzaniga）和其他人
Mike Gazzaniga and others
找出这些侧向差异
figured out these lateralized differences.
但我们不听这些江湖上流传的东西
but let's just try and demolish the myth
什么右脑是综合性的 整体的和情感性的
that the right side is synthetic and holistic and emotive,
左脑是逻辑的 顺序的和分析性的
and that the left side is logical, sequential, and analytic,
你是左脑人还是右脑人
that you're a left brain person or a right brain person.
这跟事实一点都不着边
Nothing could be further from the truth.
没有科学证据支持这一点
There's no scientific evidence to support that.
还有一些病变研究
And there's a few lesion studies
可以控制效果
that can tease out effects
那让你认为这就是证据
that make you think that's what's happening,
但真正认真的研究
but the really careful work
它们的结果指向完全不同的方向
points in a totally different direction.
我们无法进行完整的对话
We can't have a complete conversation
关于情感 纽带和社会联系
about emotions and bonds and social connection
而不去谈谈论催产素
without talking about oxytocin.
催产素如此突出
Oxytocin has come to such prominence
在过去十年左右的时间里 似乎无处不在
in the last decade or so, and seems to be everywhere.
每当你听到讨论时
Anytime you hear a discussion
关于大脑中的神经科学或大脑中的激素
about neuroscience in the brain or hormones in the brain,
催产素是响应雌性泌乳而释放的
oxytocin is released in response to lactation in females,
它是根据性互动而释放的
it is released in response to sexual interactions.
它被释放以响应非性接触
It is released in response to non-sexual touch.
它在男性和女性中都会释放
It's released in males and females,
确实涉及配对绑定
and indeed it's involved in pair bonding
以及一般来讲就是建立社会纽带
and the establishment of social bonds in general.
它如何做到这一点  似乎是通过匹配内部状态来实现的
How it does that seems to be by matching internal state.
好像增加了
It seems to both increase
内部状态的同步
synchrony of internal state somehow,
也许它设置了一个平静或机敏的水平
maybe it sets a level of calmness or alertness.
这似乎是一个合理的假设
That seems like a reasonable hypothesis,
以及提高人们的意识
as well as raising people's awareness
去感知他们伴侣的情感状态
for the emotional state of their partner.
再一次 这给我们
And again, this brings us
带回到戒备心轴
back to this alertness calmness axis
以及这个感知 感知轴
and this interoceptive, exteroceptive axis.
为了形成良好的纽带
In order to form good bonds,
我们不能只是在思考我们的感受
we can't just be thinking about how we feel,
我们还需要注意别人的感受
we also need to be paying attention to how others feel,
我们正在评估是否匹配
and we're evaluating a match.
我们正在尝试看看是否
We're trying to see whether or not
我们状态之间似乎存在某种同步
there seems to be some sort of synchrony between states.
催产素 似乎增加了同步性
And oxytocin, both seems to increase that synchrony
同时也提高对他人情绪状态的感知
and increase awareness for the emotional state of others.
我知道你们中的许多人
Now I know many of you
可能马上反应说  镜像神经元 镜像神经元
are probably screaming mirror neurons, mirror neurons.
就像某些人所知 镜子是神经元
Mirror, neurons, as some of you may know,
你们当中有些人可能不知道
and some of you perhaps may not,
是在动物和人类中发现的神经元
are neurons that were discovered in animals and humans
他们有回应
for their ability to respond
当人们进行某些身体动作时
when people engage in certain physical actions
比如拿起笔一样
like lifting of a pen,
但是相同的神经元会做出反应
but the same neurons would respond
当有人看着别人抬笔时
when somebody watched someone else lift a pen.
所以它们真的是镜子
So they were really mirrors of,
代表行为的镜子
were representing mirrors of behavior,
自我和他人
both in self and in others.
镜像神经元很有争议
Mirror neurons are very controversial.
我有许多非常尊重神经科学家
There are many neuroscientists who I respect a lot,
他们不认为镜像神经元存在
who don't think they exist,
因为他们看数据
because they look at the data,
 至少在他们心中
and the data, at least in their mind
在同理心这个现象中被过度解释
were over interpreted in the realm of empathy
也在他人的情感状态赋予价值这方面被过度解释
and in assigning value to the emotional states of others.
当我看文献时
And when I look at the literature,
我的观点是大脑中确实存在神经元
my opinion is that indeed there are neurons in the brain
清楚地代表了他人的行为
that clearly represent the actions of others,
但是还不清楚
but it's not clear
他们是否融入了情感和同理心系统
that they're wired into the emotion and empathy system
以任何直接方式
in any direct way.
我认为 越来越多的共识是镜像神经元
And I think the growing consensus is that mirror neurons,
虽然这个名字很棒 而且很吸引人
while the name is terrific and it's so catchy,
并且涵盖了这么多
and encompasses so much
你希望它包含的内容
of what you would love for it to encompass,
但是数据并不能真正支持这一点
but that the data don't really support that.
但这是有争议的 我非常高兴
But this is controversial, and I'm perfectly happy
如果有专家
to get experts on here
可以与我辩论它
that could debate it better than I could.
但是大脑中有神经元
There are however neurons in the brain
是我同事发现的
that were discovered by my colleague,
斯坦福大学的Keren Haroush
Keren Haroush at Stanford
当她在Noam Ziv的实验室工作时
when she was working in Noam Ziv's Lab,
这清楚地表明了一个事实  灵长类物种
that clearly point to the fact that primate species
在做假设
are making assumptions
并试图预测
and are trying to predict the behavior
他们物种的其他成员的行为
of other members of their species.
这是一个实验
It's an experiment,
我没有时间详细介绍
I don't have time to go into in real detail,
我们可能应该让Keren来
we should probably just get Keren on here.
对于你们中的那些
For those of you
熟悉囚犯的困境
that are familiar with the prisoner's dilemma,
这确实是合作的典范
which is really a model of cooperation,
你可以合作
you can either cooperate
或给定互动中的一个成员可以合作
or one member of a given interaction can cooperate
而另一个不会
and the other one won't,
你们俩都无法合作
where you can both not cooperate.
你可以通过多种方式解决此问题
There are ways in which you can solve this,
所谓的囚徒困境
so-called prisoner's dilemma,
通过查看以前的行为
by looking at previous behavior
并预测可能的下一个行为
and making predictions about the likely next behavior
另一个人会参与
that the other individual will engage in.
而且确实有神经元
And there do seem to be neurons
做这些预测或计算的东西
that are doing these sorts of predictions or computations.
再次 我将在以后更详细地介绍这一点
Again, I'll go into this in more detail in the future.
因此 与其考虑镜像神经元
So rather than thinking about mirror neurons,
像神经元换位
like neurons for empathy,
我认为比较正确的是
I think it's more correct
把这种神经元
to think about neurons
想成试图预测他人的行为
that are trying to predict the behavior of others.
正如我们所说
And that's, as we said,
情绪的核心特征之一
one of the core features of emotions,
建立联系
which are to establish bonds,
通过这些纽带
and through those bonds,
能够预测行为
to be able to predict behavior.
因此催产素是这种能力的一个组成部分
So oxytocin is one component of this ability
预测他人的行为并指导我们自己的行为
to predict others' behavior and to guide our own behavior.
所以这是一些实验
So here's some experiments
涉及鼻内催产素的给药
that involve the administration of intranasal oxytocin.
我认为你需要处方
Now I think you need a prescription,
尽管在某些地方你没有
although in some places you don't.
有些人正在服用鼻内催产素
There are people who are taking intranasal oxytocin
为了尝试增加社会连接的深度
in order to try and increase the depth of bonding.
我不建议你这样做
And I don't recommend you do that.
我从来没有尝试过
I've never tried that.
不管我释放的什么催产素
Whatever oxytocin I've released,
我都没有用鼻内用药
I've made without an intranasal exogenous application.
但是报道称
But what's been reported
鼻内催产素增进了夫妻之间的积极沟通
is increased positive communication among couples.
因此人们在研究中服用了鼻内催产素
So people have taken intranasal oxytocin in studies.
这样的研究
So that study,
对于你们喜欢的人
for those of you like,
发表在《生物精神病学》上
was published in Biological Psychiatry,
我的精神病学同事告诉我的是一本好期刊
which my psychiatry colleagues tell me is a fine journal.
标题是
And the title is
鼻内催产素增加积极沟通
intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication
并降低压力激素皮质醇水平
and reduces the stress hormone cortisol levels
在夫妻冲突中
during couple conflict,
让受试者吵架
they have them fight,
或者让他们在有或没有催产素的情况下进行吵架
or they have them fight with and without oxytocin.
很有趣
So interesting.
非常符合催产素的想法
Very much in line with the idea that oxytocin
是“信任激素”
is the "trust hormone."
这有点符合
That's sort of in keeping with that.
那是2009年的论文
That was a 2009 paper.
例如 还有其他证据
There's other evidence, for instance,
男人表现出更大的联系感和亲密感
that men report a greater sense of connection and intimacy
和他们的伴侣在性爱中
with their partners during sex
服用鼻内催产素后
after taking intranasal oxytocin.
有针对自闭症儿童的研究
There are studies in autistic children.
给他们鼻内催产素作为一种方法
Giving them intranasal oxytocin as a way
尝试帮助他们建立更好的社交关系
to try and help them establish better social connection
和“同理心”或心理理论
and "empathy" or theory of mind.
我以前讲过心理理论
I've talked about theory of mind before,
在了解其他孩子
were understanding of what other children
和成年人正在经历
and adults are experiencing.
催产素似乎确实会产生这些一般影响
Oxytocin does seem to create these general effects,
以及他们在一种情况或另一种情况下的细微差别
and how nuanced they are in one situation or another,
我不知道
I don't know.
我知道 有人告诉我
I'm aware and I was told,
我绝对不建议这样做
and I'm definitely not recommending this,
有一种催产素氯胺酮鼻喷雾剂
that there's a marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray.
现在我不知道了
Now I have no idea.
也许有人可以发表评论
Maybe someone can put in the comments
为什么要结合催产素和氯胺酮
why you'd want to combine oxytocin and ketamine.
我无法想象为什么
I can't imagine why.
氯胺酮是一种解离麻醉药
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic
用于治疗PTSD
that's used for the treatment of PTSD.
它曾经被用作休闲药
It used to be used as a recreational drug.
它与PCP非常相似 实际上似乎很危险
It's very similar to PCP, seems quite dangerous in fact.
我不知道为什么要将这两种物质结合在一起
I don't know why those two things would be combined,
为什么要合并它们
why one would want to combine them.
但是确实有产品
But there are products out there
似乎结合了这两种物质
that seem to combine those two things.
我不确定为什么会那样做
And I'm not certain why one would do that,
但有趣的是 它被生产出来了
but it's interesting to note that it's happening.
关于催产素的一项特别有趣的研究是
A particularly interesting study about oxytocin is that,
发表在《神经科学》杂志上
that was published in the journal, Neuroscience,
这是一本好期刊
which is a good journal,
催产素调节
that oxytocin modulates
男女之间的社会距离
social distance between males and females.
这很有趣
So that's interesting.
他们所做的是他们给了催产素
What they did is they gave oxytocin
给一夫一妻制的人
to people that were in monogamous relationships,
然后他们评估了
and then they evaluated the extent to which the,
在这种情况下
in this case,
在那些关系中的男性
the males in those relationships
会注意视觉上的注意
would pay attention to visual attention
吸引其他潜在的合作伙伴
to attractive other potential partners.
好像
And it seemed like
从这项研究中得出的一般结论
that the general takeaway from this study
是催产素管理
is that oxytocin administration
似乎促进了一夫一妻制的行为
seemed to promote monogamous behavior.
所以行为不合时宜
So behavior that wasn't in line
一夫一妻制
with monogamy of the relationship that they were in
而不是为可能的新伴侣觅食
as opposed to a foraging for potentially new mates.
当然 这些现在都是人工实验
Now of course, these are somewhat artificial experiments
或非常人工的实验
or very artificial experiments,
取决于你如何解释它们
depending on how you interpret them.
但是总的主题
But the general theme
催产素促进一夫一妻制
is that oxytocin is promoting monogamy,
促进配对
it's promoting pair bonding,
它正在促进
it's promoting
了解他人的内部状态
a understanding of the internal state of others,
这需要增强的外在感受力
which requires enhanced exteroception
对于那些特定的其他人
for those particular others.
因此 不只是让它们到处都是
So not just generally having them look everywhere
看看世界上正在发生什么
and see what's going on in the world,
但要特别注意
but particularly paying attention
到别人的情绪状态
to the emotional states of others.
我敢肯定你们中的几个人会问
I'm sure several of you will be asking,
“好吧 我该怎么做才能增加催产素”
"Well, what can I do to increase oxytocin,"
如果那是你的目标
if that's your goal.
有一些证据
There's some evidence.
我再次邀请你
And I invite you again
前往inspect.com或其他类似PubMed的网站
to go to examine.com or another such site like PubMed
如果你想看PubMed
if you want to forage PubMed,
维生素D是正常生产所必需的
that vitamin D is required for proper production,
在某些情况下
and in some cases
补充时会增加催产素的水平
can increase levels of oxytocin when supplemented,
这很有趣
which is interesting.
不管你相信与否 褪黑激素
And that believe it or not, melatonin,
或老朋友褪黑激素
or old friend melatonin,
我一直反对将其作为睡眠的补充
which I have pushed back against as a supplement for sleep,
因为我的看法
because of what I view
由于褪黑素在大多数情况下具有不良的副作用
as untoward side effects of melatonin in most cases,
但在某些情况下似乎是褪黑激素
but it seems like melatonin in some cases
可以启动系统
can prime the system
催产素释放略有增加
for slightly increased oxytocin release.
甚至有一份报告
There's even one report,
虽然对我来说看起来并不那么强大
although it didn't look that strong to me
低剂量的咖啡因可能会增加催产素的释放
that low doses of caffeine could increase oxytocin release.
但这对我来说属于
But that to me falls under the category
曾经描述过的
of what was once described
当注入人或动物时作为药物
as a drug when injected into a person or animal
在生产科学论文方面总是很有效的
is always effective at producing a scientific paper.
意味着你可以得到结果
Meaning that you can get a result,
但是结果并不总是那么稳健
but the result isn't always so robust.
因此 你始终希望阅读过去的标题和摘要
So you always want to read past the titles and the abstracts
并查阅相关论文
and get into the meat of the paper.
当我这样做的时候
And when I did that,
效果几乎可以忽略不计
the effects were pretty negligible
与咖啡因催产素
with caffeine on oxytocin.
但有趣的是维生素D和褪黑激素
But it's interesting that vitamin D and melatonin
可能对催产素的释放有积极作用
may have some positive effects on oxytocin release.
但是就像我说的
But like I said,
很多人都在服用催产素
many people are just taking oxytocin
直接通过这些鼻内喷雾剂
directly through these intranasal sprays.
我很确定在大多数地方都是处方药 但是请检查一下
I'm pretty sure it's prescription in most places, but check.
再说一次 我不建议任何人这样做
And again, I'm not recommending anybody do that.
我从来没有尝试过
I've never tried it.
我不知道会怎样
I don't know that I will.
我想我会坚持使用自产的催产素
I think I'm going to stick with the oxytocin that I've got.
我们身体产生的另一个分子
The other molecule that we make
这对于社会纽带和情感尤为重要
that's extremely important for social bonds and emotionality
是我们将要谈论的更多
is one that we're going to talk about more
在激素的一个月中 那是加压素
in the month on hormones, that's vasopressin.
加压素抑制排尿
Vasopressin suppresses urination.
是身体做的
It's made by the body,
但它被开发为一种治疗
but it was developed as a treatment
为了尿崩症
for something called diabetes insipidus,
也就是患者小便过度
where people urinate excessively,
他们实际上有脱水的风险
and they actually risk dehydration
而且他们会损失很多电解质 等等
and they can lose a lot of electrolytes, et cetera.
因此 它会导致水分滞留
So it causes water retention.
饮酒会抑制血管加压素
Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin.
这么多酒
So large amounts of alcohol,
很多人排泄 很多液体等等
many people excrete, a lot of fluid and so forth.
加压素直接对大脑有影响
Vasopressin has effects on the brain directly.
它实际上会产生轻快的爱的感觉
It actually creates feelings of giddy love.
它还以非常有效的方式增强记忆
It also increases memory in very potent ways.
有一个完整的生物黑客社区
There's a whole biohacking community
一直困扰着血管加压素
that has been dabbling with vasopressin for some time.
我从来没有尝试过
I have never tried it.
我当然不推荐
I certainly don't recommend it.
这是处方药
It is prescription.
这是一个药效很大的处方  
It is a pretty serious compound to start messing with,
因为它在体内有很多不同的作用
because it has so many different effects in the body.
之所以有趣 是因为它创造了一种轻快的爱感
It's interesting because it creates the sense of giddy love.
它也被用作壮阳药
It's also used somewhat as an aphrodisiac,
所以它类似于催产素
so it's similar to oxytocin.
它也有非常有趣的效果
It also has very interesting effects
一夫一妻或非一夫一妻的行为
on monogamous or non-monogamous behavior.
同样 我们将在将来再次进行讨论
This, again, we will revisit in the future.
但是有一系列漂亮的实验
But there's a beautiful set of experiments
在一个小的啮齿动物物种中完成的
that have been done in a little rodent species
叫做草原田鼠
called a prairie vole.
原来
It turns out
草原田鼠有两种不同的种群
there are two different populations of prairie voles,
有些是一夫一妻制
some are monogamous,
他们总是和相同的草原田鼠对象见面
they always meet with the same other prairie vole,
还有一些非常坚决地非一夫一妻制
and some are very robustly non-monogamous,
他们会尽可能多地与其他草原田鼠交配
they mate with as many other prairie voles as they can.
并证明了加压素的水平
And turns out that levels of vasopressin
和/或加压素受体
and/or vasopressin receptor
决定他们是否一夫一妻制
dictate whether or not they're monogamous or not.
实际上 在人类中有一些有趣的证据
And there's actually some interesting evidence in humans.
当人们报告自己的行为时
When people report their behavior,
假设他们的报告准确无误
assuming they're reporting accurately,
加压素和加压素的水平
that vasopressin and vasopressin levels
可能与一夫一妻制有关
can relate to monogamy
或非一夫一妻制
or non-monogamy in humans as well.
我们将在本月有关激素的话题上进行讨论
We're going to talk about this in the month on hormones.
如果我们在谈论情绪的神经科学
If we're talking about the neuroscience of emotions,
我们必须谈论迷走神经
we have to talk about the vagus nerve.
我在之前的一期中讲了迷走神经
I described what the vagus nerve is in a previous episode,
这些就是这些
that it's these connections
在身体和内脏之间的联系
between the body and the viscera,
包括肠 心脏 肺
including the gut, the heart, the lungs
以及免疫系统和大脑
and the immune system and the brain,
而且大脑也在控制这些器官
and that the brain is also controlling these organs.
所以这是一条双向路
So it's a two-way street.
我之前提到过一个很大的错误信息
There's this big myth out there that I mentioned before,
以各种方式刺激迷走神经
that stimulating the vagus in various ways
导致平静
leads to calmness.
它总是会让你平静下来的
That it's always going to calm you down.
那是错误的
And that is false.
我只想重复一遍 那是完全错误的
I just want to repeat that is completely false.
实际上 这里有篇论文 是另一篇论文
In fact, it was just paper, yet another paper
前几天发表
published the other day,
很棒 这是大卫·麦考密克实验室（David McCormick Lab）的作品
which is fantastic, which is from David McCormick Lab
在俄勒冈大学
up at the University of Oregon.
它发表在《当代生物学》 优秀期刊
It's published in Current Biology, excellent journal,
表明 我读一下标题
showing, I'm just reading the title,
迷走神经刺激可引起广泛的皮质
vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical,
神经皮层和行为激活
the neocortex and behavioral activation.
我读了这篇论文 太棒了
I've read the paper, it's fantastic.
它再次说明了
It illustrates yet again,
迷走神经的刺激增加了多巴胺的释放
stimulation of the vagus increases dopamine release,
增加大脑机敏性的激活
increases activation of the brain alertness.
这是机敏的刺激物
It is a stimulant of alertness,
它并没有使人们平静下来
it is not calming people down.
鉴于情感 这很有趣
Now this is interesting in light of emotionality
由于许多小组已经完成了工作
because of work that's been done by many groups,
但特别是
but in particular,
我将专注于我的一位同事的工作
I'm going to focus on the work of a colleague of mine,
斯坦福大学的精神病学家卡尔·戴瑟罗（Karl Deisseroth）
Karl Deisseroth at Stanford, who's a psychiatrist,
但也开发了很多工具
but has also developed a lot of tools
实时调整神经元的活动
to adjust the activity of neurons in real time
使用光和电刺激等等
using light and electrical stimulation and so forth.
我请你参考《纽约客》上的一篇文章
I'll refer you to an article in the New Yorker
这是几年前发表的
that was published about this a few years ago
我将阅读一个简短的摘录
I'm going to read a brief excerpt.
我也将链接放在标题中
I'll put the link in the caption as well.
他正在和一个极度自杀的抑郁症患者交谈
He's talking to an extremely suicidal depressed patient
患者身上植入了小型设备
who has a small device implanted
这可以让她调整迷走神经的活动
that allows her to adjust her vagus nerve activity.
那么迷走神经刺激
Now vagus stimulation
最初开发用于治疗癫痫病
was originally developed for the treatment of epilepsy.
现在 它被用于其他各种目的
It's now being used for various other purposes.
似乎迷走神经刺激甚至可以增加可塑性
Vagus stimulation can even increase plasticity, it seems.
再次 迷走神经活动增加
So again, increasing activity of the vagus
提高警觉性
increases alertness,
实时查看发生的事情真是令人难以置信
and it's just incredible to see what happens in real time
迷走神经受到刺激时会产生情绪激动
to emotionality when the vagus is stimulated,
再次 不是平静下来 而是提高警觉性
again, not calming, but activating alertness.
他们在他的办公室里 他们在说话
They're in his office and they're talking,
他问她最近怎么样
and he asks her how she's doing,
她描述了她以前所做的事情
and she describes how she's been doing previously
称其为“摊饼”
as "going pancake,"
意思是这个人就瘫着
which for her just means totally laid out flat,
什么都不做
not much going on.
她谈到  自己不想去工作
She talks about how she doesn't want to pursue a job.
真的很沮丧
She's really depressed.
他说 以典型的好精神病医生的方式
And he says in typical good psychiatrist fashion,
“好吧 确实有太多事情要考虑了”
"Well, that's a lot to think about,"
这是他说的
that's actually the quote.
他们谈论她的血压等等
And they talk about her blood pressure, et cetera.
然后她说
And then she says,
情绪一直在下降 螺旋下降
mood's been down, just spiraling down,
失眠 噩梦 食欲不振
talks about insomnia, bad dreams, low appetite.
因此 这是严重的抑郁症
So this is severe depression.
这就是我们所说的严重抑郁
This is what we call major depression.
然后她要求
And then she requests,
“迷走神经刺激能提高到1.5吗？”
"Can we please go up to 1.5 on vagus stimulation?"
她一直在接受1.2毫安的电流
She'd been receiving 1.2 milli amps
每五分钟到30秒刺激一次
of stimulation every five minutes to 30 seconds
但不再能感觉到这种作用
but was no longer able to feel the effects.
所以他说
So he says,
“好吧 我认为我们可以稍微提高一点
"Okay, I think we can go up a little,
你对事情的容忍度很好”
you're tolerating things well."
他们开始刺激
They start the stimulation and,
“在接下来的几分钟内 萨莉...”她的名字叫萨莉
"In the course of the next few minutes," her name was Sally,
“经历了重大改变 她的眉头消失了
"underwent a remarkable change, her frown disappeared.
她变得开朗
She became cheerful,
开始描述她曾经拥有的快乐
describing the pleasure she'd had
在圣诞节假期
during the Christmas holiday
并讲述她最近的情况
and recounting how she'd recently
观看了一些Deisseroth的YouTube视频
watched some YouTube videos of Deisseroth.
会议结束时她仍在微笑和交谈
She was still smiling and talking when the session ended,
他们走到接待区”
and they walked out to the reception area."
因此 这仅仅是通过刺激和激活迷走神经
So this is just by stimulating and activating the vagus.
现在为什么要提起这个？
Now why am I bringing this up?
好吧 由于多种原因 一个是迷走神经真的很神奇
Well, for several reasons, one is the vagus is fascinating
就大脑与身体的联系而言
in terms of the brain body connection,
二 我想消除错误信息
two, I'd like to, trying to dispel the myth
迷走神经的刺激只在于保持镇定
that vagus stimulation is all about being calm,
其实是提高警惕
it's really about being alert.
我不知道原来是怎么倒退的
I don't know how that originally got going backwards,
但这是要保持警惕
but it's about being alert.
再一次 保持警惕或保持冷静
And once again, level of alertness or level of calmness
在影响情感
is impacting emotion,
这个警觉和平静的轴心
that this axis of alertness and calmness
是情感的主轴
is one primary axis in emotion.
不是唯一的一个
It's not the only one,
因为也有好或坏的价数部分
because there's also this valence component of good or bad.
那不是唯一的两个
Those two aren't the only ones,
因为也有这个成分
because there's also this component
内部感受性的 外部感受性的
of interoceptive, exteroceptive
我们之前讨论过的
that we talked about earlier.
而且还会有其他因素
And there will be others too.
再说一次 它并不详尽
Again, it's not exhaustive.
但是我觉得很有趣
But I find it fascinating,
确实使我们回到了起点
and it really brings us back to where we started,
这是情感的核心要素
which is what are the core elements of emotion,
那你该怎么办？
and what can you do about them?
在今天关闭之前 我只想确保
And before we close up today, I just want to make sure that
即使我提到了一些工具
even though I've mentioned some tools,
我谈到了情绪应用
I talked about the Mood Meter app,
我谈到催产素
I talked about oxytocin
还有一些影响催产素的东西
and some of the things that impact oxytocin,
我谈到了一些方法
I talked about some of the ways
你可以概念化情绪
that you can conceptualize emotions.
你如何概念化情绪的这项能力
This business of how you conceptualize emotions
确实是你所拥有的最强大的工具
is really the most powerful tool you can ever have
在理解
in terms of understanding
并调节你的情绪状态上
and regulating your emotional state.
如果你愿意尝试整理好脑袋里的思绪
If you're willing to try and wrap your head around it,
我意识到这不是最简单的事情
I realize it's not the simplest thing to do.
但是 与其将情绪仅仅视为这些标签
But rather than think of emotions as just these labels,
快乐 悲伤或沮丧
happy, sad, or depressed,
想着情绪
thinking about emotions, excuse me,
作为大脑和身体的元素
as elements of the brain and body
包括警惕性水平
that encompass levels of alertness
包括与外界互动的动态
that include a dynamic with the outside world
和你对内部状态的感知
and your perception of your internal state.
并开始以结构化的方式
And starting to really think about emotions
去考虑情绪
in a structured way
不仅让你了解
cannot only allow you to understand
一些病理
some of the pathology
你何时可能会感到沮丧或焦虑
of when you might feel depressed or anxious
或其他人感到沮丧和焦虑
or others are depressed and anxious,
而且可以发展
but also to develop
对任何事物都有更丰富的情感体验
a richer emotional experience to anything.
当然 现在我不希望
Now of course, I don't expect that
当你在外面与朋友互动时
as you're out there interacting with friends
并且你正在看电视并体验生活
and you're watching TV and experiencing life,
你应该解析你的每一点经验
that you should be parsing every bit of your experience
以某种简化主义和机械化的方式
in some sort of reductionist and mechanistic way.
这不是这里的目标
That's not the goal here.
但是对于你们当中的从业者
But for those of you that are practitioners,
任何的老师
teachers of any kind,
对于孩子
for those of you that are kids,
对于那些想要了解
for those of you that are trying to understand
你的情感生活和意识如何的人
what your emotional life and your consciousness,
哈我居然说了这个词
dare I say the word,
真的包括
really consists of,
我相信这些是基本要素
I do believe that these are fundamental elements
得到科学的大力支持
that are well-supported by the science
跨各种研究人员
across a variety of researchers
从各种不同的角度做事
doing things from a variety of different perspectives
有些人彼此同意
and some of whom agree with one another
而有些人则没有
and some of whom don't.
因此 我将其作为知识的来源提供给你
So I offer it to you as a source of knowledge
从那里你可以开始
from which you can start
我希望以不同的方式思考你的情感生活
to think about your emotional life differently, I hope,
以及其他
as well as others
以一种使体验丰富的方式
in a way that builds more richness into that experience,
但这并不损害它
not that detracts from it.
与之相关的最后一点
One last point as it relates to that,
你们中的许多人问我关于迷幻疗法的问题
many of you have asked me about psychedelic therapies
现在出现了诸如psilocybin和MDMA之类的东西
that are now emerging, things like psilocybin and MDMA,
我们当然是
we are of course
将深入探讨该主题
going to dive into that topic deeply.
我们邀请了一位专家来讨论这个话题
We have an expert guest coming on to discuss that topic.
这些化合物显然会影响情绪方面
Those compounds clearly affect the aspects of emotionality
我们今天讨论的就是这些
that we were talking about today,
冷静 机敏 效价 好坏
calmness, alertness, valence, good or bad,
内部感受性 外部感受性  定位
interoceptive, exteroceptive positioning.
因此 不只是进行粗略的探索
And so rather than just do a kind of cursory exploration
这些化合物中
of those compounds
以及什么是治疗和科学界
and what the therapeutic and scientific community
正在考虑它们及其功能
is thinking about them and how they function,
我认为这更重要
I think it's more important
将该框架嵌入我们的思想中
to embed that framework in our thinking
这样当我们处理迷幻药时
so that when we address psychedelics
我们还处理其他种类的疗法
and we address other sorts of therapies,
认知行为疗法
cognitive behavioral therapy,
不同类型的情感疗法
different types of emotive therapies
与个人 夫妇等有关的
that relate to individuals and couples et cetera,
我们能够考虑他们
that we are able to think about them
具有某种结构和严谨性
with some sort of structure and rigor
而不是仅仅把它们当作一堆化学药品来谈论
rather than just talk about them as a bunch of chemicals
产生这些惊人的经历
that produce these amazing experiences
人们需要告诉你的
that people need to tell you about.
因为如果有一个真相
Because if there's one truth,
似乎迷幻似乎促进了
it seems that psychedelic seem to promote activity
关于迷幻体验的故事讲述的活动
of storytelling about psychedelic experience.
但这本身并不是治疗社区真正需要的
But that itself is not really what the therapeutic community
也不是学术界感兴趣的
and the academic communities are interested in,
他们有兴趣尝试了解
they're interested in trying to understand
普遍真理
the universal truths,
普遍的生物学转变和心理转变
the universal biological shifts and psychological shifts
这些化合物的临床使用中会发生这种情况
that occur in the clinical use of those compounds.
因此 我们暂时暂不考虑
And so we're going to hold off for now,
但我们会谈到这些点的
but we will get to them.
再一次 我们涵盖了
Once again, we've covered
大量的材料
an enormous amount of material today.
真的等于两个
It's really the equivalent of two
甚至是三场大学课堂的内容   涵盖在一集播客中
if not three university lectures in one podcast episode.
我要感谢那些支持播客的人
I want to thank those of you that have supported the podcast

你们中的一些人询问了补品
And several of you have asked about supplements.
我谈论各种情节中的补品
I talk about supplements in various episodes.
我们与索恩（Thorne）合作
We've partnered with Thorne
因为我们认为索恩
because we think Thorne
严格程度最高
has the very highest levels of stringency
就原料的纯度而言
in terms of the purity of the contents
和原料的量
and the amounts of the contents.
他们真的把瓶子上列出的东西放进了瓶子
They really put in the bottle what's listed on the bottle,
对于许多补品公司而言 情况并非如此
which is not true for a lot of supplement companies.
如果你想看看我服用的补品
If you want to see the supplements that I take,
并获得折扣
as well as get a discount on those
或索恩（Thorne）制造的任何其他补品
