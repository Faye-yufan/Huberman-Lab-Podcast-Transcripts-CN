- 欢迎来到 Huberman Lab 播客
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast
我们讨论科学的地方
where we discuss science
和基于科学的日常生活工具
and science-based tools for everyday life.
[器乐]
[instrumental music]
- 我是 Andrew Huberman  我是神经生物学和眼科教授
- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
在斯坦福医学院
and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
这个播客与我在
This podcast is separate from my teaching
斯坦福大学的研究角色是分离的
and research roles at Stanford.
然而  这是我的愿望和努力的一部分
It is however, part of my desire and effort
为消费者提供有关科学的信息的零成本
to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
以及面向公众的科学相关工具
and science related tools to the general public.
为了配合这个主题
In keeping with that theme,
我要感谢今天播客的赞助商
I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
我们的第一个赞助商是 Belcampo Meat Company
Our first sponsor is Belcampo Meat Company.
Belcampo Meat Company 是一个再生农场
Belcampo Meat Company is a regenerative farm
在北加州饲养有机草饲
in Northern California that raises organic grass fed
和经过草加工的经过认证的人道肉类
and grass-finished certified humane meats.
我大约一天吃一次肉
I eat meat about once a day.
我既不是纯肉食动物  也不是素食主义者
I'm neither pure carnivore, nor am I a vegetarian.
很明显我吃肉
Obviously I eat meat.
我的饮食习惯是禁食到中午
The way I eat is I tend to fast until about noon
然后我吃了第一顿饭
and then I have my first meal
它通常由一块牛肉组成
which generally consists of a piece of beef.
它要么是碎牛肉  要么是牛排
It's either ground beef or a steak.
我喜欢肋眼  我喜欢扁铁  这些东西
I like ribeyes, I like flat irons, these kinds of things
和一份小沙拉  有时是一份大沙拉
and a small salad, sometimes a large salad.
然后一整天  我通常都是低碳水化合物
And then throughout the day, I generally am low carb
直到晚上我吃意大利面和米饭
until the evening when I eat pasta and rice
和那种东西
and things of that sort.
那样吃可以优化我的警觉度
Eating that way is what optimizes my levels of alertness
并优化我的睡眠
and optimizes my sleep.
我在之前的播客节目中谈到过这个
I've talked about this on previous podcast episodes,
那么  因为我基本上每天都吃肉
Now, because I eat meat essentially every day,
那肉的来源对我来说非常重要
the source of that meat is extremely important to me.
我希望它对我健康
I want it to be healthy for me
我想要它来自的动物
and I want the animals that it comes from
身体健康  过上美好的生活
to be healthy and to have lived a good life.
传统饲养的动物仅限于饲养场
Conventionally raised animals are confined to feedlots
他们吃炎症性谷物的饮食
and they eat a diet of inflammatory grains,
这对他们来说很糟糕  对我们来说也很糟糕
which is terrible for them and it's terrible for us
当我们吃那些肉时
when we eat those meats.
贝尔坎波的动物在开阔的牧场上吃草
Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures
和季节性草  导致肉
and seasonal grasses, which results in meat
它的营养成分和健康脂肪含量更高
that is higher in nutrients and healthy fats.
他们实际上有非常高水平的欧米茄三
They actually have very high levels of Omega threes
我在这个播客中也谈到过
which I've also talked about on this podcast,
对身心健康很重要
are important for mental and physical health
出于各种原因
for a variety of reasons.
Belcampo 饲养动物的方式
The way Belcampo raises its animals
对环境也有好处
is also good for the environment.
他们实践再生农业
They practice regenerative agriculture,
这意味着它对气候有利  对碳不利
which means it's climate positive and carbon negative
这意味着对我们和地球都有好处
which translates to good for us and good for the planet.
你可以订购 Belcampo 可持续饲养的肉类
You can order Belcampo sustainably raised meats
直接送到你家门口

今天的播客也是由 InsideTracker 带给我们的
Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.
InsideTracker 是一个个性化的营养平台
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
分析来自你的血液和 DNA 的数据
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
帮助你更好地了解你的身体
to help you better understand your body
并达到你的健康目标
and reach your health goals.
长期以来  我一直坚信要完成血液检查
I've long been a believer in getting blood work done
原因很简单  很多人
for the simple reason that many,
如果不是大多数影响因素
if not most of the factors that impact
我们眼前和长期的健康
our immediate and longterm health
只能通过验血来评估
can only be assessed from a blood test.
现在随着现代 DNA 测试的出现
And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
我们可以获得更多信息
we can get additional information
关于我们目前的健康状况和我们的健康轨迹
about our current health status and our health trajectory.
验血和 DNA 测试的主要问题之一
One of major problems with blood tests and DNA tests
可用于大多数来源是你得到的数字
available for most sources is that you get the numbers back
你可以很容易地看到这些数字是否
and you can easily see whether or not those numbers
是在标准范围内还是在范围外
are within the standard range or outside the range.
但是很难知道如何处理这些信息
But it's very hard to know what to do with that information.
还有各种因素是什么
Also what the various factors are
被测量的通常是非常神秘的
that are being measured is often very cryptic.
使用 InsideTracker  他们澄清了一切
With InsideTracker, they clarify everything.
他们使它非常清晰和简单
They make it very clear and simple
至于这些因素中的每一个都与什么有关
as to what each of those factors relates to,
所以他们让你对那些是什么有一些了解
so they give you some understanding of what those are
他们会给你想法和建议
and they give you ideas and suggestions
关于你可以用你的生活方式做的事情
about things that you can do with your lifestyle,
改变你的饮食  改变你的补充剂
changes to your diet, changes to your supplementation,
改变你的睡眠时间表或锻炼方式
changes to your sleep schedule or exercise patterns
可以用于优化水平
that can serve to optimize the levels
那些各种因素和你的 DNA
of those various factors and your DNA.
另外  他们有一种叫做内在年龄测试的东西
In addition, they have something called the inner age test
比较你的实际年龄
which compares your chronological age
你已经知道你的生理年龄
which you already know with your biological age
这让你了解自己的寿命
which gives you a sense of your lifespan
或预测寿命
or predicted lifespan.
所以这非常重要  你可以想象
So that's crucially important, and you can imagine
为什么包括我在内的很多人都想要这些信息
why many people, including me would want that information.

今天的这一集也是由Athletic Greens带给我们的
Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
athleticgreens是一种多合一的维生素矿物质
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral
益生菌饮料
probiotic drink.
我已经使用 Athletic Greens 十多年了
I've been using Athletic Greens for well over a decade now.
我开始使用 Athletic Greens 并且我仍在使用
I started using Athletic Greens and I still use
Athleticgreens  因为我觉得它相当令人眼花缭乱
Athletic Greens because I find it rather dizzying
知道要服用哪些维生素和矿物质
to know which vitamins and minerals to take.
和Athleticgreens  我涵盖了我所有的基地
And with Athletic Greens, I cover all my bases
维生素和矿物质
of vitamins and minerals.
此外  它含有益生菌  我们现在知道
In addition, it has probiotics and we now know
来自大量高质量的同行评审研究
from an enormous number of quality peer reviewed studies
肠道微生物组至关重要
that the gut microbiome is critically important
为了我们的免疫系统功能  为了肠道大脑通路
for our immune system function, for the gut brain access
和我们的心理功能
and for our mental functions
益生菌是支持肠脑轴的一种方式
and probiotics are one way to support the gut brain axis
和肠道健康
and the gut health generally.
对于Athleticgreens  我基本上只是加水
With Athletic Greens, I basically just add water,
放入少许柠檬汁
put in a little bit of lemon juice
因为那是我喜欢的方式
'cause that's the way I like it.
拌匀  味道鲜美
Mix it up, it tastes delicious.
我会每天做一到两次
I'll do that once or twice a day.
至少对我来说它与禁食兼容
It's compatible with fasting at least for me,
它不会让我退出禁食模式
it doesn't take me out of a fasting mode
我在一天早些时候做的
which I do early in the day.
所以大多数情况下  我会在一天早些时候拥有我的Athleticgreens
So most often I'll have my Athletic Greens early in the day.
然后有时我也会有另一个
And then sometimes I'll also have another one
深夜  有时甚至在睡觉前
late in the evening, or sometimes even before bed.
我喝了之后就可以睡觉了  没有问题
I'm able to sleep after drinking it without a problem.
如果你想尝试Athleticgreens
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens
你可以访问athleticgreens.com/huberman
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
如果你这样做  你可以要求特别优惠

维生素 D3 K2
of vitamin D3 K2.
也有大量数据支持这一事实
There are also a lot of data supporting the fact
维生素 D3 至关重要
that vitamin D3 is critical
用于各种健康指标
for a variety of health metrics.
我们都知道我们可以获得维生素D3
We all know that we can get vitamin D3
来自太阳  但包括我在内的很多人
from the sun, but many people including me
没有得到足够的阳光或 D3
were not getting enough sunlight or D3
即使我得到了很多阳光
even if I was getting a lot of sunlight.
我知道那是因为我测量了 D3 的血液水平
I know that 'cause I had my blood levels measured of D3.
所以我每天都使用维生素 D3
So I use vitamin D3 every day
除了我拿走的其他东西
in addition to the other things I take,

本月在 Huberman Lab 播客中
This month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
我们谈论的都是身体表现
we're talking all about physical performance.
所以这意味着运动表现  休闲运动
So that means athletic performance, recreational exercise,
举重、跑步、游泳、瑜伽、
weightlifting, running, swimming, yoga,
技能和技能学习
skills and skill learning.
今天  我们要讨论和关注
Today, we're going to talk about and focus
技能学习
on skill learning.
我们将专注于如何更快地学习技能
We are going to focus on how to learn skills more quickly
尤其是运动技能
in particular motor skills.
这也将转化为事物
This will also translate to things
比如音乐技巧和演奏乐器
like musical skills and playing instruments,
但我们将主要关注身体运动
but we're mainly going to focus on physical movements
超出手的身体
of the body that extend beyond the hands
就像只是弹钢琴或手指
like just playing the piano or the fingers
就像弹吉他一样
like playing the guitar.
但我们要谈的一切
But everything we're going to talk about
还将为组建和巩固服务
will also serve the formation and the consolidation
以及其他类型技能的表现
and the performance of other types of skills.
所以如果你对如何表现得更好感兴趣
So if you're interested in how to perform better,
不管是舞蹈还是瑜伽
whether or not it's dance or yoga
甚至是非常重复的东西
or even something that's just very repetitive
就像跑步或游泳一样  这个播客节目适合你
like running or swimming, this podcast episode is for you.
我们将深入研究技能学习的科学
We're going to go deep into the science of skill learning.
我们将讨论非常具体的工具方法
And we are going to talk about very specific protocols
科学指出并证实
that the science points to and has verified,
让你可以更快地学习以嵌入该学习内容
allow you to learn more quickly to embed that learning
以便你记住它并能够建立技能
so that you remember it and to be able to build up skills
比其他方式更快
more quickly than you would otherwise.
我们还将涉及一些事情
We are also going to touch on a few things
我经常被问到  但幸运的是最近
that I get asked about a lot, but fortunately recently
我有时间深入研究文献
I've had the time to go deep into the literature,
为你提取数据  这就是心理可视化
extract the data for you and that's mental visualization.
如何将特定技能或实践可视化
How does visualizing a particular skill or practice
服务于学习和/或巩固
serve the learning and or the consolidation
那个做法
of that practice.
事实证明有一些绝对引人注目的工具方法
It turns out there are some absolutely striking protocols
你可以使用  惊人的意思他们允许你
that one can use, striking meaning they allow you
学得更快  他们让你记住
to learn faster and they allow you to remember
更快更好地做事
how to do things more quickly and better
如果你不做这个心理彩排
than if you were not doing this mental rehearsal.
但是心理排练的模式
But the pattern of mental rehearsal
当你进行心理排练时
and when you do that mental rehearsal
结果证明是至关重要的
turns out to be vitally important.
所以我对今天的播客感到很兴奋
So I'm excited for today's episode.
我们将与你分享大量信息
We're going to share a lot of information with you
将会有很多非常简单的立即使用的理论
and they're going to be a lot of very simple takeaways.
让我们开始吧
So let's get started.
在我们进入技能学习的话题之前
Before we get into the topic of skill learning
和加速技能学习的工具
and tools for accelerating skill learning,
我想简单回顾一下温度这个话题
I want to briefly revisit the topic of temperature
上一集介绍过
which was covered in the last episode
只强调一些事情并澄清
and just highlight a few things and clear up
一些误解
some misunderstandings.
所以上一集讲了这些不可思议的数据
So last episode talked about these incredible data
来自我的同事 Craig Heller 在斯坦福大学的实验室
from my colleague, Craig Heller's lab at Stanford.
他在生物系
He's in the department of biology,
表明以特定方式冷却手掌
showing that cooling the palms in particular ways
并且在特定时间可以让运动员
and at particular times can allow athletes
或者只是休闲锻炼者做更多的引体向上
or just recreational exercisers to do more pull-ups,
双手撑体  单位时间内的卧推  跑得更远
dips, bench presses per unit time, to run further,
骑得更远  这样做会感觉更好
to cycle further and to feel better doing it.
确实有令人难以置信的数据被锚定
There really are incredible data that are anchored
在血管系统的生物学中  血液供应
in the biology of the vascular system, the blood supply
以及它如何帮助我们降温
and how it's involved in cooling us.
你们中的许多人  实际上有数十人说
Many of you, dozens of you in fact said,
“等一下  你在这一集中给了我们一个方法
"Wait a second, you gave us a protocol in this episode
“这表明我们应该定期冷却我们的手掌
"which says that we should cool our palms periodically
“在整个锻炼过程中  才能更多地运动
"throughout exercise in order to be able to do more work.
“但在在那之前的一集中  关于生长激素
"But on the episode, before that on growth hormone
“还有甲状腺激素那期里面  你说加热身体
"and thyroid hormone, you said that heating up the body
“有利于生长激素的释放”
"is good for release of growth hormone."
我只想澄清这两件事都是真的
And I just want to clarify that both things are true.
这是两个独立的工具方法
These are two separate protocols.
在运动之前  你应该总是热身
You should always warm up before you exercise.
热身不会让你的体温升高
That warmup will not increase your body temperature
或肌肉温度到
or the muscle temperature to the point
降低你的工作能力的点
where it's going to diminish your work capacity,
它不会损害你的表现
that it's going to harm your performance.
手掌的冷却  这真的只是一个
The cooling of the palms, which is really just a route
以有效的方式冷却你的核心途径
to cool your core in an efficient way,
最有效的方式  事实上
the most efficient way, in fact
是关于提高性能
is about improving performance.
通过运动加热身体
Heating up the body with exercise
并专注于热量增加或使用桑拿
and focusing on heat increases or using sauna
因为热量增加是为了促进生长激素的释放
for heat increases is geared toward growth hormone release,
这是另一回事
which is a separate matter.
所以你可以做这两个工具方法
So you can do both of these protocols
但你会想在不同的时间做它们
but you would want to do them at separate times.
所以只是为了让这个非常具体
So just to make this very concrete
在我进入今天的主题之前
before I move on to today's topic.
如果你有兴趣做更多的工作
If you're interested in doing more work,
能够在单位时间内做更多组和次数
being able to do more sets and reps per unit time
并且感觉更好做或跑得更远
and feel better doing it or to run further
或进一步循环  那么定期冷却手掌
or to cycle further, then cooling the palms periodically
正如我在上一集中所描述的
as I described in the previous episode
将是你要做的事情
is going to be the way to go.
如果你对释放生长激素感兴趣
If you're interested in getting growth hormone release,
那么热桑拿
well then hot sauna.
如果你没有桑拿  我提供了一些其他工具
And I offered some other tools if you don't have a sauna
在关于生长激素和甲状腺激素的那一集中
in the episode on growth hormone and thyroid hormone
将是要走的路
is going to be the way to go.
所以这些是单独的工具方法
So those are separate protocols.
你可以将它们纳入你的健身计划
You can include them in your fitness regime
和你的训练制度  但你确实想这样做
and your training regime, but you do want to do them
在不同的时间
at separate times.
作为最后一点
And as a last point about this,
我还提到咖啡因可以帮助
I also mentioned that caffeine can either help
或阻碍身体性能取决于是否
or hinder performance depending on whether or not
你适应了咖啡因  因为方式
you're caffeine adapted because of the ways
咖啡因会影响体温
that caffeine impacts body temperature
以及各种诸如血管扩张和收缩之类的事情
and all sorts of things like vasodilation and constriction.
这很简单
It's very simple.
如果你在锻炼前喜欢咖啡因
If you enjoy caffeine before your workouts
你习惯了咖啡因  这意味着你喝了它
and you're accustomed to caffeine, meaning you drink it
一周三五次或更多
three or five times or more a week.
100 至 300 毫克  这是典型的每日剂量
100 to 300 milligrams this is a typical daily dose
的咖啡因
of caffeine.
你们中的一些人摄入更多  一些更少
Some of you are ingesting more, some less.
如果你经常这样做
If you do that regularly,
那么  摄入咖啡因就好了
well, then it's going to be just fine to ingest caffeine
在你训练之前
before you train.
它不会影响你的体温
It's not going to impact your body temperature
和你的血管扩张或收缩
and your vasodilation or constriction
以会阻碍你的方式
in ways that will hinder you.
但是  如果你不是经常喝咖啡因的人
However, if you're not a regular caffeine user
你在想  “哦  我要喝杯咖啡
and you're thinking, "Oh, I'm going to drink a cup of coffee
“并获得这种巨大的身体性能增强效果”
"and get this huge performance enhancing effect."
嗯  这不会发生
Well, that's not going to happen.
有可能会导致增加
Chances are it's going to lead to increases
体温和血液流动方式的变化
in body temperature and changes in the way that blood flow
发生在你的身体里  特别是
is happening in your body, and in particular
在这些手掌表面和你的脸上
on these palmer surfaces and in your face
这可能会降低性能
that is going to likely diminish performance.
所以如果你喜欢咖啡因并且已经习惯了
So if you enjoy caffeine and you're accustomed to it,
所谓的咖啡因适应  请在训练前享用
so-called caffeine adapted, enjoy it before your training.
如果你经常  请原谅  如果你不经常
If you regularly, excuse me, if you do not regularly
使用咖啡因  那么你可能不想查看咖啡因
use caffeine, then you probably do not want to view caffeine
作为性能增强工具
as a performance enhancing tool.
当我们谈论工具时
And while we're on the topic of tools
因为这是关于运动表现的一个月
and because this is a month on athletic performance
以及锻炼和身体技能学习
and exercise and physical skill learning,
我想提供一个额外的工具
I want to offer an additional tool
我当然觉得很有用  这是如何缓解
that I've certainly found useful, which is how to relieve
所谓的侧缝或侧抽筋
the so-called side stitch or side cramp
跑步或游泳时
when running or swimming.
这实际上与呼吸有关
This actually relates to respiration
和神经系统  它不是抽筋
and to the nervous system and it is not a cramp.
如果你曾经出去跑步  你觉得
If you've ever been out running and you felt like
你的身边很痛
you had a pain on your side,
痛苦可以是任何数量的事情
that pain could be any number of things,
但感觉像你身边的抽筋
but what feels like cramping of your side
实际上是由于所谓的侧支投射神经循环
is actually due to what's called collateralization
这是比侧抽筋或侧缝
of the phrenic nerve which is a lot harder to say
更复杂的说法
than a side cramp or a side stitch.
但情况是这样的
But here's the situation.
你有一组神经  叫做膈神经
You have a set of nerves, which is called the phrenic nerve
PHRENIC
P-H-R-E-N-I-C.
从脑干向下延伸的膈神经
The phrenic nerve, which extends down from your brainstem
本质上  这个区域到你的横膈膜
essentially, this region to your diaphragm
来控制你的呼吸
to control your breathing.
它有抵押品  这意味着它有一个分支
It has a collateral, meaning it has a branch
就像树上的树枝可以革新你的肝脏
just like the branch on a tree that innovates your liver.
如果你的呼吸不够深
And if you are not breathing deeply enough,
可能发生的是你有时可以得到所谓的
what can happen is you can get what's called sometimes
参考疼痛
a referenced pain.
参考疼痛可能会很熟悉
Reference pain is probably going to be familiar
给你们读过的任何人
to any of you have ever read
关于如何识别心脏病发作
about how to recognize heart attack.
心脏病发作的人有时会感到疼痛
People have heart attacks will sometimes have pain
在他们身体的一侧  左臂
on one side of their body, the left arm,
有时人们背部的一部分疼痛
sometimes people that have pain in a part of their back
或者突然肩膀也痛
or suddenly also get pain in their shoulder
或他们脸的一部分
or part of their face.
这与我们的许多神经分支这一事实有关
This has to do with the fact that many of our nerves branch,
意味着他们有抵押
meaning they're collateralized
到身体的不同器官和部位
to different organs and areas of the body.
那些神经交织在一起的方式
And the way those nerves are woven together,
通常情况下  如果我们破坏模式
it's often the case that if we disrupt the pattern
电活动的激发
of firing of electrical activity
在那些神经分支之一
in one of those nerve branches
其他人也受到影响
that the other ones are affected too.
侧缝  你身边的疼痛经常发生
The side stitch, the pain in your side as often
因为横膈膜的收缩
because of the contractions of the diaphragm
因为你锻炼时的呼吸方式
because of the way you're breathing while you're exercising,
跑步、游泳或骑自行车
running, or swimming or biking.
结果  你会感到痛苦
And as a consequence, you feel pain in your side
但这不是抽筋
but that's not a cramp.
缓解的方法很简单
The way to relieve it is very simple.
你做我说过的生理方面
You do the physiological side that I've talked about
在播客的前几集和其他地方
in previous episodes of the podcast and elsewhere
就是通过鼻子双吸气
which has a double inhale through the nose,
非常深  然后长长的呼气
very deep and then a long exhale.
你可能想重复两三遍
And you might want to repeat that two or three times.
通常这会减轻侧缝
Typically that will relieve the side stitch
因为它改变了发射模式的方式
because of the way that it changes the firing patterns
膈神经的
of the phrenic nerve.
所以侧缝很烦人  很痛苦
So the side stitch is annoying, it's painful,
有时我们认为我们脱水了
sometimes we think we're dehydrated
你可能会脱水
and you might be dehydrated.
但很多时候只是我们在呼吸
But oftentimes it's just that we're breathing
以某种方式引起肝脏的一些参考疼痛
in a way that causes some referenced pain of the liver.
我们称之为侧缝或侧抽筋
We call it a side stitch or a side cramp,
你可以很容易地缓解它
and you can relieve it very easily
通过双吸气  长呼气
through the double inhale, long exhale.
那个图案做了两三遍
That pattern done two or three times,
通常你可以继续从事这项运动
often you can continue to engage in the exercise
当你做双吸气呼气时
while you do the double inhale exhale,
它只会以这种方式缓解自己
and it will just relieve itself that way.
因此  如果你遇到侧针  请尝试一下
So give it a try if you experience the side stitch.
我认识的一些人也在做双吸气
Some people I know are also doing the double inhale,
在长时间的连续运动中长时间呼气
long exhale during long continuous bouts of exercise.
我实际上是在跑步时这样做的
I actually do this when I run.
我们有不错的数据  尽管这些仍然是
We have decent data although these are still
可以参与的未公开数据
unpublished data that that can engage
一种有规律的心率变异性节奏
a kind of regular cadence of heart rate variability.
所以这个生理方面的原因有很多
So there are a number of reasons why this physiological side
可能有用  但它肯定有用
can be useful, but it certainly can be useful
用于缓解侧针或所谓的侧抽筋
for relieving the side stitch or so-called side cramp.
让我们谈谈新技能的获得
Let's talk about the acquisition of new skills.
这些可能是技能  例如高尔夫挥杆或网球挥杆
These could be skills such as a golf swing or a tennis swing
或者你在罚球或者你正在学习跳舞
or you're shooting free throws or you're learning to dance
或者你正在学习一种乐器
or you're learning an instrument.
我将主要关注运动表现
I'm mainly going to focus on athletic performance.
基本上有两种类型的技能
There are basically two types of skills.
开环和闭环
Open loop and closed loop.
开环技能是你执行的技能
Open loop skills are skills where you perform
某种运动动作然后你等待
some sort of motor action and then you wait
你会得到即时的反馈
and you get immediate feedback
至于它是否正确完成
as to whether or not it was done correctly or not.
一个很好的例子是向飞镖板投掷飞镖
A good example will be throwing darts at a dartboard.
所以如果你扔飞镖  你会得到反馈
So if you throw the dart, you get feedback
关于你是否击中靶心
about whether or not you hit the bullseye,
你不在飞镖盘上  或者你在其他地方
you're off the dart board, or you're some other location
在飞镖板上  这是开环
on the dart board, that's open loop.
闭环将是更连续的东西
Closed loop would be something that's more continuous.
假设你是一名跑步者并且你正在开始
So let's say you're a runner and you're starting
做一些速度工作和一些冲刺
to do some speed work and some sprints.
你在跑步  你可以感觉到
And you're running and you can kind of feel
无论你是否正确运行
whether or not you're running correctly,
或者甚至有一个教练  他们正在纠正
or maybe even have a coach and they're correcting
你的步伐或者你正在尝试做某种技能
your stride or you're trying to do some sort of skill,
就像跳房子的技巧  也许你正在做
like a hopscotch skill, which maybe you're doing
梯子在你踩到的地方工作
the ladder work where you're stepping
地面指定空间之间
between designated spaces on the ground.
这是一个闭环  因为当你走的时候
That's closed loop because as you go,
你可以调整你的行为  你可以调整距离
you can adjust your behavior and you can adjust the distance
你的步数  或者你可以调整你的速度
of your steps, or you can adjust your speed
或者你可以调整你的姿势  你就可以
or you can adjust your posture and you are able
基本上每单位时间做更多的练习
to essentially do more practice per unit time
但是你会时不时地得到反馈
but you're getting feedback on a moment to moment basis.
所以你有开环和闭环
So you have open loop and closed loop.
只是为了说明这一点
And just to make this very clear,
开环练习你的网球发球
open loop would be practicing your tennis serve.
假设你设定了一个目标
So let's say that you set a target
在网的另一边
on the other side of the net.
你把球抛起来  然后击中球
You throw the ball up and you hit the ball,
它过去了  这是开环
it goes over that's open-loop.
你会知道你是否在球场上
You'll know whether or not you were in the court,
你在你想击中的位置
you were on the location you wanted to hit
或接近与否  这是开环
or close to it or not, that's open loop.
如果是平常的情况  那就是闭环
Closed loop would be if you're in a regular can.
所以也许你正在学习游泳
So maybe you're learning a swim stroke,
或者也许你正在尝试学习特定的节奏
or maybe you're trying to learn a particular rhythm
在鼓上
on the drum.
所以也许你正在尝试学习特定的节拍
So maybe you're trying to learn a particular beat.
我不是很喜欢音乐  所以我不会让自己难堪
I'm not very musical, so I'm not going to embarrass myself
通过举一个例子  虽然稍后我会
by giving an example of this, although later I will,
你试图降低特定节奏的地方
where you're trying to get a particular rhythm down.
如果你没有得到它  你可以实时调整
And if you're not getting it, you can adjust in real time
并尝试赶上或减速或加速  等等
and try and catch up or slow down or speed up, et cetera.
所以希望你能理解开环​​和闭环
So hopefully you'll understand open loop and closed loop.
在尝试学习一项技能之前  你应该始终知道
You should always know before you try and learn a skill,
无论是开环还是闭环
whether or not it's open loop or closed loop
我很快就会回到为什么这很重要
and I'll return to why that's important shortly.
但是如果你想学点东西
But if you want to learn something,
请问是开环还是闭环
ask is it open loop or closed loop.
任何技能基本上都包含三个组成部分
There are essentially three components of any skill
这涉及运动
that involves motor movement.
而那些是感官知觉  实际上是感知
And those are sensory perception, actually perceiving
你在做什么以及你周围正在发生什么
what you are doing and what's happening around you.
所以你所看到的  你所听到的
So what you see, what you hear,
有时你会注意你在做什么
sometimes you're paying attention to what you're doing
特别喜欢你手臂的轨迹
specifically like the trajectory of your arm
或者你如何移动你的脚
or how you're moving your feet.
如果你正在学习跳舞  有时你会更专注
If you're learning to dance, sometimes you're more focused
发生在你之外的事情
on something that's happening outside of you,
就像你在听音乐一样
like you're listening for something in music
或者你正在关注
or you're paying attention
你的伴侣移动的方式  等等
to the way your partner is moving, et cetera.
所以有感官输入
So there's sensory input.
然后是实际的动作
Then there are the actual movements.
所以它们是你的四肢和身体的运动
So they're the movements of your limbs and body.
然后有一种叫做本体感觉的东西
And then there's something called proprioception
和本体感觉经常被讨论
and proprioception is often discussed
作为一种知道你的四肢在哪里的第六感
as kind of a sixth sense of knowing where your limbs are
相对于你的身体
in relation to your body.
所以本体感觉非常重要
So proprioception is vitally important.
如果我伸手拿起这支笔并捡起来
If I reached down and pick up this pen and pick it up,
我没有去想我手里的笔在哪里
I'm not thinking about where the pen in my hand is
相对于我的身体  但在本体感觉上  我意识到了
relative to my body, but proprioceptively, I'm aware of it
在一种六感更深的潜意识层面
at kind of a six sense deeper subconscious level.
我也可以让自己知道我的四肢在哪里
I can also make myself aware of where my limbs are.
通常当我们学习时  我们会更加关注本体感觉
And typically when we learn, we are placing more focus
比平时更加关注
on proprioception than we do ordinarily.
所以如果我从这把椅子上站起来 我碰巧走路
So if I get up from this chair and I happen to walk
走出房间  我不去想我的脚在哪里
out of the room, I don't think about where my feet
相对着陆
are landing relative to one another.
但如果我的腿处于休眠状态
But if my leg had fallen asleep
因为我一直靠在我腿的一根神经上
because I had been leaning on one of the nerves of my leg
或类似的东西  我的腿感觉刺痛或麻木
or something like that, and my leg feels all tingly or numb.
我和你  如果这发生在你身上
I and you, if this were to happen to you,
会立即注意到步态的变化
would immediately notice a shift in gait.
感觉怪怪的  我得注意了
It would feel strange, I'd have to pay attention
我的脚步
to how I'm stepping.
原因是我没有得到
And the reason is I'm not getting
任何本体反馈
any proprioceptive feedback.
那么  技能学习也有很多其他维度
Now, skill learning has a lot of other dimensions too,
但这些是我们要关注的主要问题
but those are the main ones that we're going to focus on.
所以只是提醒你  你需要知道开环
So just to remind you, you need to know open loop
或闭环  你需要知道是否
or closed loop and you need to know whether or not,
对不起  你需要知道有感官知觉
excuse me, you need to know that there's sensory perception
你在关注什么
what you're paying attention to,
运动本身和本体感觉
movements themselves and proprioception.
还有一件重要的事情你需要知道
And there's one other important thing that you need to know
即产生任何类型的运动
which is that movement of any kind is generated
来自你神经系统内的一个、两个或三个来源
from one, two or three sources within your nervous system,
在你的大脑和身体内
within your brain and body.
这些是中央模式生成器
These are central pattern generators
有时被称为 CSPG  对不起  CPGS
which are sometimes called CSPGs, excuse me, CPGSs,
CSPG 在生物学上是完全不同的东西
CSPGs are something entirely different in biology.
CPGS  这只是表明我有一个模块
CPGSs, this just goes to show that I have a module.
CSPG 是软骨样和硫酸盐蛋白聚糖
CSPGs are chondroid and sulfate proteoglycans.
与这个话题完全没有关系
They have nothing to do with this topic.
CPGS 是中央模式发生器
CPGSs are central pattern generators or CPGs,
或它们有时被称为 CPG
they're sometimes called.
这些 CPG 在你的脊髓中  我的和你的
These CPGs are in your spinal cord, mine and yours,
不同的  它们会产生重复的动作
different ones and they generate repetitive movements.
所以如果你在走路  如果你在跑步  如果你在骑自行车
So if you're walking, if you're running, if you're cycling,
如果你在呼吸  大概你是
if you're breathing, which presumably you are
你以有规律的节奏做这件事
and you're doing that in a regular rhythmic cadence,
中央模式发生器正在控制这种运动
central pattern generators are controlling that movement.
在你学会如何走路、跑步、游泳、骑自行车后
After you learn how to walk, run, swim, cycle,
做任何事情  大部分工作都交给了
do anything really, much of the work is handed off
中央模式发生器
to the central pattern generators.
并且有一些实验
And there were experiments that were done
在 60 、70 、80 年代做的  阐明了
in the 60s, 70s and 80s that actually looked
在去脑动物甚至去脑人类
at decerebrate animals and even decerebrate humans.
就是些缺乏大脑皮层的人类和动物
These are humans and animals that lack a cerebral cortex.
他们缺乏很多大脑  但他们可以参与
They lack much of the brain and yet they can engage
在所谓的虚构运动中
in what's called a fictive movement.
所以这听起来像是一种野蛮的实验
So it sounds like a kind of barbaric experiment.
我很高兴我不是真正做实验的人
I'm glad I wasn't the one to have to do them
但这是神经科学教科书的内容
but this is the stuff of neuroscience textbooks
去除了新皮质的猫、狗或老鼠
that cats or dogs or mice that have their neocortex removed
把他们放在跑步机上  它们会走路
put them on a treadmill, they'll walk just fine.
它们会很好地调整他们的步行速度
And they will adjust their speed of walking just fine
即使他们基本上缺乏所有的思考
even though they basically lack all their thinking
和决策大脑
and decision-making brain.
事实证明  人类有
And it turns out humans that have,
不幸的是  对他们的皮层的大量打击
unfortunately, massive strokes to their cortex
并没有任何新皮质
and lack any neocortex but preserve
但保留了中央模式生成器也可以正常行走
the central pattern generators will also walk just fine,
即使他们的大脑中缺乏任何其他东西
even though they lack any of the other stuff in the brain.
所以这些 CPG 或 CPGS 很惊人
So these CPGs or CPGSs are amazing,
它们控制了我们很多已经学会的行为
and they control a lot of our already learned behavior.
当你真的擅长某件事时
When you're really good at something,
CPG 控制了很多这种行为
CPGs are controlling a lot of that behavior.
高尔夫挥杆也是如此
And that's true also for a golf swing.
即使不是真的重复
Even if it's not really repetitive,
一个非常擅长打高尔夫球的人
somebody who's really good at golf it's going to,
我猜叫T
I guess you call it a T.
你把球放在 T 上
You put the ball on the T.
我展示了我对高尔夫的了解
I show with my knowledge of golf.
坦率地说  我只打过迷你高尔夫球
I've only done mini golf, frankly,
但也许有一天我会学会打高尔夫球
but someday maybe I'll learn how to golf,
但是你放下高尔夫球并挥动
but you set the golf ball down and swing,
放下高尔夫球  挥杆
set the golf ball down, swing.
中央模式生成器将处理
Central pattern generators are going to handle
很多
a lot of that.
如果我去高尔夫球场
If I were to go to the golf course.
斯坦福有一个漂亮的高尔夫球场
Stanford has a beautiful golf course.
如果我出去在T上放一个球
If I were to go out there and put a ball on the T,
我的中央模式生成器不会参与
my central pattern generators would not be involved
根本不会
in that at all.
当我把球杆带回挥杆的那一刻
The moment I bring the club back to swing,
它会涉及其他事情
it's going to engage other things.
以及其他需要参与的事情
And the other things that's going to engage
因为我现在不知道那种行为
because I don't know that behavior now or then
是上运动神经元
is upper motor neurons.
我们的皮层有运动神经元
We have motor neurons in our cortex,
在我们控制刻意行动的新皮层中
in our neocortex that control deliberate action.
那些在你学习的时候
And those are the ones that you're engaging
都会参与进去的
when you are learning.
这些才是你要注意的
Those are the ones that you have to pay attention
为了参与进去
in order to engage.
这就是正在发生的事情  例如
And that's what's happening, for instance,
如果我决定伸手拿起我的笔
if I decide I'm going to reach down and pick up my pen,
我很少考虑  但现在我正在考虑
which I rarely think about, but now I'm thinking about it
我将以一种非常深思熟虑的方式来做这件事
and I'm going to do this in a very deliberate way.
我要用这两个手指抓住并抬起
I'm going to grab with these two fingers and lift.
我的上运动神经元现在参与其中
My upper motor neurons are now involved.
所以上运动神经元非常重要
So upper motor neurons are very important
因为在这一集的后面
because a little bit later in the episode
当我们谈论如何使用可视化时
when we talk about how to use visualization
为了加速技能学习
in order to accelerate skill learning,
它将利用这些上运动神经元
it's going to leverage these upper motor neurons
以非常特殊的方式
in very particular ways.
所以我们有节奏运动的CPG
So we have CPGs for rhythmic movement,
上运动神经元用于故意未学习的运动
upper motor neurons for deliberate unlearned movements
或我们正在学习的动作
or movements that we are in the process of learning.
然后我们有了所谓的下运动神经元
And then we have what are called lower motor neurons.
下运动神经元是我们脊髓中的神经元
Lower motor neurons are the ones in our spinal cord
将小电波发送到我们的肌肉
that send little wires out to our muscles
这实际上导致了这些肌肉纤维的燃烧
which actually caused the firing of those muscle fibers.
所以你要这么想
So the way to think about this as you've got
与 CPG 对话的上运动神经元
upper motor neurons which talk to CPGs
和下运动神经元
and the lower motor neurons.
所以这真的很简单
So it's really simple.
而那么  你知道所有要知道的东西
And now, you know most everything there is to know
关于控制运动的神经通路
about the neural pathways controlling movement,
至少为了这次讨论
at least for sake of this discussion.
所以每当我们学到东西时  我们必须决定
So anytime we learn something, we have to decide
把我们的感官知觉放在什么地方
what to place our sensory perception on,
意味着我们要关注什么
meaning what are we going to focus on.
如果你正在听这个  这很重要
That's critical if you're listening to this
而你是那种喜欢记笔记的人
and you're the type of person who likes taking notes,
这应该是你问的第二个问题
this should be the second question you ask.
记住第一个问题是  它是开环
Remember the first question is, is it open loop
还是闭环？
or closed loop?
第二个问题应该是
The second question should be,
我应该把注意力集中在什么上  听觉上的注意力
what should I focus my attention on, auditory attention,
视觉注意力或本体感觉
visual attention or proprioception.
我应该专注于我的四肢相对于我的身体的位置吗
Should I focus on where my limbs are relative to my body
还是应该关注结果？
or should I focus on the outcome?
这是一个关键的区别
This is a critical distinction.
你可以决定学习如何挥杆
You can decide to learn how to do a golf swing
或学习如何罚球
or learn how to shoot free throws
或学习如何跳探戈
or learn how to dance tango
并决定你要专注
and decide that you are going to focus
关于你伴侣的动作
on the movements of your partner
或者你的脚的位置
or the positions of your feet.
你也许会看看它们
You maybe are going to look at them,
也许你会感觉到它们
maybe you're going to sense them.
你会真正感觉到他们在哪里
You're going to actually feel where they are,
或者也许你会感觉到这个位置
or maybe you're going to sense the position
和你身体的姿势  这更像是本体感觉
and posture of your body, which is more proprioception.
所以你必须分配你的注意力
So you have to allocate your attention.
我会告诉你如何最好地分配你的注意力
And I'm going to tell you how to allocate your attention
为了学得更快
best in order to learn faster.
所以这些是你必须做出的决定
So these are the sorts of decisions that you have to make.
对你来说幸运的是  你不必考虑
Fortunately for you, you don't have to think
关于你是否要使用
about whether or not you're going to use
你的上运动神经元和你的下运动神经元
your upper motor neurons and your lower motor neurons
或者不用  因为如果你不知道如何做某事
or not, because if you don't know how to do something,
你会自动参与
you're automatically going to engage
你的上运动神经元
your upper motor neurons.
如果你这样做了  那么你就不会使用
And if you do, then you're not going to use
你的上运动神经元
your upper motor neurons.
你将主要依赖中央模式生成器
You're mainly going to rely on central pattern generators.
你总是在使用你的下运动神经元
You are always using your lower motor neurons
移动肌肉
to move muscle.
所以我们现在可以真正简化事情
So we can really simplify things now.
我已经给了你很多信息  但我们可以简化它
I've given you a lot of information but we can simplify it.
基本上是开环或闭环  这是一个问题
Basically open loop or closed loop, that's one question
我要关注什么？
and what am I going to focus on?
然后你的神经会处理剩下的
And then your neurology will take care of the rest.
所以现在我想谈谈现实的期望
So now I want to talk about realistic expectations.
大概在好莱坞的某个地方
Somewhere in Hollywood presumably,
它已嵌入某人的脑海中
it got embedded in somebody's mind
即时获得技能是可能的
that instant skill acquisition was possible,
你可以服用特定的药丸
that you could take a particular pill
或者你可以触摸一个特定的物体
or you could touch a particular object
或者你可以用魔杖挥动你
or you could have a wand wave over you
你会突然拥有一项技能
and you would suddenly have a skill.
这就是好莱坞的结果
And so that is the result of Hollywood at all.
它不存在  至少在现实中不存在
It doesn't exist, at least not in reality.
我喜欢电影  但它根本不存在
And I love movies, but it simply doesn't exist.
然后鸡汤文创造了另一个规则
Then the self-help literature created another rule
称为 10,000 小时规则
called the 10,000 hours rule.
坦率地说  这与文献并不相符
And frankly, that doesn't really match the literature,
至少与科学文献不相符
at least the scientific literature either.
我喜欢它  因为它意味着学习需要时间
I like it because it implies that learning takes time,
这比好莱坞更准确
which is more accurate than the Hollywood at all
即时技能获取规则
instant skill acquisition rule,
这不是一个真正的规则  这是一个神话
which isn't really a rule, it's a myth.
但是 10,000 小时规则忽略了一些关键的东西
But the 10,000 hours rule overlook something crucial,
这不是关于小时
which is that it's not about hours,
这是关于重复
it's about repetitions.
那么  当然有时间之间的关系
Now, of course there's a relationship between time
和重复  但有一些美丽的实验
and repetitions, but there are some beautiful experiments
这表明通过简单的调整
that point to the fact that by simple adjustment
当你试图学习时你所关注的新技能时
of what you are focused on as you attempt to learn
可以调整重复次数
a new skill, you can adjust the number of repetitions
来调整你的学习动机
that you do, you adjust your motivation for learning
你可以大大加快学习速度
and you can vastly accelerate learning.
你们中的一些人可能会通过它的互联网名称认识到这一点
Some of you may recognize this by its internet name,
这不是一个科学术语
which is not a scientific term,
这就是“超级马里奥效应”
which is the super Mario effect.
实际上 YouTube 上有一个很好的视频
There's actually a quite good video on YouTube
描述超级马里奥效应
describing the super Mario effect.
我认为这是一个拥有我认为有科学背景的 YouTuber
I think it was a YouTuber who has I think a background
他做了一个有趣的实验
in science and he did an interesting experiment.
我先说说他的实验
And I'll talk about his experiment first
然后我会谈谈神经生物学
and then I will talk about the neurobiology
这支持他得到的结果
that supports the result that he got.
超级马里奥效应与游戏有关
The super Mario effect relates to the game
超级马里奥兄弟  但你会在最后看到原因
super Mario brothers, but you'll see why at the end.
但基本上他们所做的是他们有 50,000 个试验者
But basically what they did was they had 50,000 subjects,
这是大量的试验者  他们学习一个程序
which is a enormous number of subjects learn a program,
基本上是从计算机程序中获取单词
essentially taking words from a computer program
或计算机程序的命令
or the commands for a computer program
有点聚集在右侧的列中
that were kind of clustered in a column on the right.
所以这些是计算机程序员需要做  会熟悉的事情
So these are the sorts of things that computer programmers
但其他人不会
will be familiar with but other people won't.
这些命令本质上是
And those commands are essentially,
它们基本上可以转化为“前进”之类的东西
they essentially translate to things like go forward.
然后如果是在迷宫中右转
And then if it's a right hand turn in the maze,
然后向右走并继续直到你到达一个选择点
then go right and continue until you hit a choice point,
等等
et cetera.
所以这是一堆指令  但受试者的工作
So it's a bunch of instructions, but the job of the subjects
在这些实验中组织这些指令
in these experiments were to organize those instructions
以一种特殊的方式允许一个小光标
in a particular way that would allow a little cursor
成功通过迷宫
to move through the main successfully.
所以基本上目标是  或者至少受试者们都被告知
So basically the goal was, or at least what the subjects
被告知的是  任何人都可以学习计算机编程
were told is that anyone can learn to computer program.
如果有人可以组织说明
And if somebody can just organize the instructions
以正确的方式  那么他们可以编程
in the right way, then they can program
让这个小光标移动通过迷宫  很简单
this little cursor to move through amaze, very simple.
然而  如果你没有任何背景
And yet, if you don't have any background
在计算机编程中  或者即使你这样做
in computer programming, or even if you do,
这需要一些技巧
it takes some skill.
你必须知道要发出什么命令
You have to know what commands to give
以什么特定的顺序
in what particular order.
他们让这一切变得非常容易
And they made that very easy.
你可以把它们组合成一个列表
You could just assemble them in a list
在右边
over onto the right.
于是人们开始这样做
So people started doing this.
现在有两组和大约一半的受试者
Now there were two groups and some one half of the subjects,
如果他们弄错了  这意味着他们输入了命令
if they got it wrong, meaning they entered a command
光标会移动  这是错误的命令
and the cursor would move and it was the wrong command
为了让这个小光标在迷宫中移动
for this little cursor to move through the maze,
他们看到屏幕上跳出一个信号  上面写着
they saw a signal jump up on their screen that said,
这不起作用  请重试
that did not work, please try again.
就是这样  如果他们输入了错误的命令
That's it, if they put in the wrong command
或者语句错误  它会说没有用
or is in the wrong sequence, it'll say that did not work
请再试一次
please try again.
然后受试者会重新组织指令
And then the subjects would reorganize the instructions
然后小光标会继续
and then the little cursor would continue.
如果他们又弄错了
And if they got it wrong again,
它会说不起作用  请再试一次
it would say that does not work, please try again.
另一半的受试者  如果他们做错了什么
The other half of the subjects, if they got something wrong
被告知你刚刚丢掉了5分  请继续
were told you just lost five points, please continue.
所以  这是他们得到的反馈​​的
So, that's the only difference in the feedback
唯一区别
that they got.
现在我不得不承认  我早就预料到了
Now I have to confess, I would have predicted
基于我对多巴胺电路的了解
based on my knowledge of dopamine circuitry
奖励应急和肾上腺素和压力
and reward contingency and epinephrin and stress
和积极的学习
and motivated learning.
我们被告知的另一件事
And this other thing that we've been told
在许多关于行为经济学的书中
in many many books on behavioral economics
在自助文献中
and in the self-help literature,
那就是人们会更加努力地工作
which is that people will work much harder
以防止丢失某些东西
to prevent losing something than they will
而不是去获得一些东西  你一直听到这种理论
to gain something, that you hear all the time.
事实证明  这根本不是实际发生的
And it turns out that that's not at all what happened.
如果他们看受试者的成功率
If they looked at the success rate of the subjects,
他们发现被告知的对象
what they found was that the subjects that were told
没有用  请再试一次  成功率为 68%
that did not work, please try again, had a 68% success rate.
68% 的人继续成功地编程了这个光标
68% of them went on to successfully program this cursor
穿过迷宫
moving through the maze.
而那些被告知你失去了五分
Whereas the ones that were told you lost five points
有 52% 的成功率  这是一个显着的差异
had a 52% success rate, which is a significant difference.
但成功的源头还是缺乏成功
But the source of the success or the lack of success
真的很有趣
is really interesting.
被告知“不对  请重新再试一遍”的受试者
The subjects that were told that did not work,
每单位时间中  会尝试很多很多次
please try again, tried many, many more times per unit time.
换句话说  他们在编程方面做了更多尝试
In other words, they made more attempts at programming
这个东西允许这个光标在迷宫中移动
this thing to allow this cursor to move through the maze.
而被告知你的人失去了五分
Whereas the people that were told you lost five points
提前放弃或完全放弃
gave up earlier or gave up entirely.
好的  让我们退后一步
Okay, so let's just step back from this
因为对我来说  这是非常令人惊讶的
because to me, this was very surprising.
它违反了很多我听说过的东西
It violates a lot of things that I'd heard
在那种流行文化或营销号中
in the kind of popular culture or the self-help literature
人们会更加努力地工作以避免丢失某些东西
that people will work much harder to avoid losing something
比他们会得到一些东西
than they will to gain something.
它并不符合我的理解
And it didn't really fit with what I understood
关于奖励意外事件和多巴胺
about reward contingencies and dopamine,
但它确实适合另一组实验
but it did fit well with another set of experiments
我非常熟悉
that I'm very familiar with
来自神经科学文献
from the neuroscience literature.
我会先给你点睛之笔
And I'll give you the punchline first.
然后我们将了解这些数据的含义
And then we're going to take what these data mean
我们将讨论一个学习工具方法
and we're going to talk about a learning protocol
你可以使用  可以让你更快地学习技能
that you can use that will allow you to learn skills faster
通过自愿参与更多的重复
by willingly participating in more repetitions
技能学习  这意味着你会想要
of the skill learning, meaning you will want
做更多的重复  即使你做错了
to do more repetitions even if you're getting it wrong
部分或大部分时间做错
some or most of the time.
所以我想告诉你的实验
So the experiment that I want to tell you about
称为试管
is called the tube test.
这通常是在老鼠身上完成的
And this is generally done in mice,
虽然有时是在老鼠身上完成的
although it's sometimes been done in rats
它与某些事情有很多相似之处
and it has a lot of parallels to some things
你甚至可能见过和经历过
that you've probably seen and experienced even
在人类生活中  在正常生活中  甚至在你的生活中
in human life, in regular life, maybe even in your life.
所以这是实验
So here's the experiment.
你拿两只老鼠  把它们放在一个管子里或两只老鼠里
You take two rats, you put them in a tube or two mice,
你把它们放在管子里
you put them in a tube.
老鼠  它们不喜欢共用一个管子
And mice and rats, they don't like to share the same tube.
所以他们会做的是他们会开始互相推动
So what they'll do is they'll start pushing each other
来回  来回
back and forth, back and forth.
迟早  其中一只老鼠
Sooner or later, one of the rats or mice
将另一个推出
pushes the other one out.
被淘汰的就是输家
The one that got pushed out is the loser,
得到管子的是赢家
the one that gets the tube is the winner.
然后把赢家放入  你给了它一个新的竞争对手
Now you take the winner, you give it a new competitor.
你发现的是老鼠
And what you find is that the mouse or rat
以前赢过的那只老鼠
that won previously has a much higher
第二次获胜的机会概率会更高
than chance probability of winning the second time.
换句话说  之前获胜会导致再次获胜
In other words, winning before leads to winning again.
反过来也是如此
And the reverse is also true.
如果你接受失败者  然后把那个失败者放进去
If you take the loser and you put that loser in
用另一只老鼠  新老鼠  新老鼠
with another mouse, fresh mouse, new mouse,
失败者通常会以更大的概率失败
the loser typically will lose at much greater probability than chance.
而这与力量或大小的差异无关
And this is not related to differences in strength or size
或睾丸激素或任何其他东西
or testosterone or any other things
可能会让人想到的作为对此的解释
that might leap to mind as explanations for this
因为这些都被控制了
because those were all controlled for.
现在这个结果已经知道了几十年
Now that results have been known about for decades.
但是三年前  有一篇论文发表
But three years ago, there was a paper published
在 Journal Science 中  现象级期刊
in the Journal Science, phenomenal journal.
它是三大顶级期刊之一
It's one of the three apex journals,
检查了与此相关的大脑区域
that examined the brain area that's involved in this.
变成额叶皮层的特定区域
Turns out a particular area of the frontal cortex
对于那些想知道的人
for those of you that want to know.
他们做了一个简单的实验  实验者
And they did a simple experiment where the experimenters
增加或减少这个大脑区域的活动
increased or decreased the activity of this brain area
在前额叶皮层
in the prefrontal cortex,
前额叶皮层的小亚区
little sub region of the prefrontal cortex.
他们发现如果他们刺激这个大脑区域
And what they found is if they stimulated this brain area,
小鼠或大鼠  无论是否
a mouse or rat, regardless of whether or not
它以前是赢家或输家
it had been a winner or loser before,
每次都成为赢家
became a winner every single time.
他们表明  如果他们阻止了该活动
And they showed that if they blocked the activity
这个大脑区域  无论是否
of this brain area, regardless of whether or not
这只老鼠曾经是赢家或输家
the mouse or rat had been a winner or loser,
它每次都成为失败者
it became a loser every single time.
这转化为其他场景
And this translated to other scenarios,
他们放置一堆老鼠的其他竞争场景
other competitive scenarios where they'd put a bunch of mice
在一种凉爽的房间里
or rats in a kind of cool chamber,
他们会在角落里放一个小加热灯
they'd have a little heat lamp in the corner
老鼠喜欢热
and mice like heat.
并且只有一只老鼠的足够空间
And there was only enough space for one mouse
处于高温之下
to be under the heat.
以及在试管测试中获胜的那个
And the one that had won in the tube test
或者大脑区域受到刺激
or that had the brain area stimulated
总是能得到很好的温暖的地方
always got the nice warm spot.
那么这个神奇的大脑区域是什么  它在做什么呢？
So what is this magic brain area, what is it doing?
好吧  我今天提出这个的原因
Well, the reason I'm bringing this up today
以及我紧随其后的原因
and the reason I'm bringing it up on the heels
超级马里奥效应的关键在于
of the super Mario effect is that stimulation
刺激这个大脑区域   有一个非常简单的
of this brain area had a very simple
和非常重要的作用
and very important effect,
也就是说  它导致了更多的前进的动作  更多的重复
which was, it led to more forward steps, more repetitions,
更多的努力  但不是纯粹的力量和意志
more effort, but not in terms of sheer might and will,
不是挖得更深  只是单位时间内的重复次数更多
not digging deeper, just more repetitions per unit time.
失败者单位时间内的重复次数更少
And the losers had fewer repetitions per unit time.
所以超级马里奥效应  这个在线实验
So the super Mario effect, this online experiment
以及试管测试
and the tube test, which has been done
已经通过各种实验室并一次又一次地重复
by various labs and repeated again and again
指出一个简单但非常重要的规则
point to a simple but very important rule,
这既不是 10,000 小时规则
which is neither the 10,000 hours rule
也没有好莱坞版魔法棒的学习
nor the magic wand Hollywood version of learning.
而是神经生物学的解释
But rather the neuro-biological explanation
学习一项技能是你想要执行的
for learning a skill is you want to perform
单位时间内尽可能多地重复
as many repetitions per unit time, as you possibly can.
至少当你第一次尝试学习一项技能时
At least when you're first trying to learn a skill.
我想重复一遍  你要尽可能多地尝试
I want to repeat that, you want to perform as many repetitions
至少在你第一次尝试学习一项技能时
as you possibly can at least when you're first trying
要这么做
to learn a skill.
现在这听起来像是废话  只是更多的重复
Now that might sound like a duh, it just more reps,
但它不是那么明显
but it's not so obvious.
没有理由说  重复更多
There's no reason why more repetitions
必然会导致更快的学习
should necessarily lead to faster learning
因为你也可以说  嗯  更多的重复
because you could also say, well, more repetitions,
你可以犯更多错误
you can make more errors
这些错误会导致性能不佳
and those errors would lead to poor performance
就像多次失误
like misstepping a number of times.
在这些情况下  反馈很少
And in these cases, there's very little feedback.
不是每次老鼠都往前推  或移回
It's not like every time the rat pushes forward
它都在感应
or moves back that it is sensing,
哦  我赢了  我输了  我赢了  我输了
oh I'm winning, I'm losing, I'm winning, I'm losing
在微观层面
on a micro level.
它可能会这样做  因为它开始将另一个推出
It probably does that as it starts to push the other one out
老鼠可能会想  “我赢了”
the rat or mouse probably thinks, "I'm winning."
当它倒退时  它可能会想  “我输了”
And as it's backing up, it probably thinks, "I'm losing."
当你玩这款超级马里奥游戏时
As you play the game, the super Mario game,
你被告知  不  那没有用
you are told, nope, that didn't work.
不  这不起作用  请重试
Nope, that didn't work, please try again.
但重要的是获胜者
But the important thing is that the winners
每单位时间总是产生更多的重复
are always generating more repetitions per unit time.
这只是表现的重复
It's just a repeat of performance, repeat of performance
即使有错误
even if there are errors.
这指出了一些非常重要的事情
And that points to something vitally important,
重复很重要  但重复犯错误
which is reps are important but making error reps
也很重要
is also important.
事实上  这可能是最重要的因素
In fact, it might be the most important factor.
那么让我们来谈谈错误以及为什么它们可以解决问题
So let's talk about errors and why those solve the problem
决定我们要关注什么
of what to focus on.
因为正如我之前所说  如果你想学习一些东西
Because as I said earlier, if you want to learn something,
你需要知道它是开环还是闭环
you need to know if it's open loop or closed loop
你需要知道要关注什么
and you need to know what to focus on,
在哪里放置你的感知
where to place your perception.
这似乎是一项艰巨的任务
And that seems like a tough task
但是错误会告诉你确切地关注什么
but errors will tell you exactly what to focus on.
那么让我们来谈谈错误以及为什么可以利用错误
So let's talk about errors and why you can leverage errors
以加快技能学习
to accelerate skill learning.
好的  所以我们已经确定了表演
Okay, so we've established that performing
每节训练的最大重复次数
the maximum number of repetitions per training session
将是有利的
is going to be advantageous.
这可能看起来很明显  但也有阴暗的一面
And that might seem obvious but there's a shadowy side
那个  也就是说  我为什么要重复
to that, which is, well why would I want to just repeat
如果我弄错了  一遍又一遍地重复同样的事情
the same thing over and over again if I'm getting it wrong,
90%的时间
90% of the time.
原因是错误实际上提示
And the reason is that the errors actually cue
你的神经系统有两件事；
your nervous system to two things;
一是纠错  二是打开了
one to error correction and the other is it opens the door
神经可塑性的窗口
or the window for neuroplasticity.
神经可塑性是大脑和神经系统的能力
Neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous system's ability
根据经验而改变
to change in response to experience,
本质上是自定义修改自己
essentially to custom modify itself
为了更好地执行任何事情
in order to perform anything better.
我们做了整整一个月的神经可塑性研究
We did an entire month on neuroplasticity
我谈了一点错误
and I talked a little bit about errors
以及为什么它们很重要
and why they're important.
现在我们要把它变得非常具体
Now we're going to make this very concrete
并对其进行操作  使其非常具有可操作性
and operationalize it, make it very actionable.
有一篇论文是2021年发表的
There was a paper that was published in 2021
来自诺曼等人
from Norman at all.
这是一篇非常重要的论文
This is a very important paper.
它发表在神经元杂志上
It was published in the Journal Neuron
这是细胞出版社期刊  优秀期刊
which is a cell press journal, excellent journal.
论文的标题基本上讲述了其内容
The title of the paper gives it away essentially,
犯错后补充额叶感觉的皮层投射
which is post error recruitment of frontal sensory
会促进注意力
cortical projections promotes attention.
那么  这意味着当你犯错时
Now, what that says is that when you make an error,
它会激活大脑区域
it causes an activation of the brain areas
锚定你的注意力
that anchor your attention.
记住我们需要知觉、注意力
Remember we need perception, attention,
它们本质上是一样的
which they're essentially the same thing.
我们需要本体感觉  我们需要上部
We need proprioception and we need the upper
和下运动神经元以正确的方式进行交流
and lower motor neurons to communicate in the proper ways.
这个至关重要的问题是要注意什么
And this vital question is what to pay attention to.
错误告诉你的神经系统
Errors tell your nervous system
有些事情需要改变
that something needs to change.
所以如果你正在执行一项任务或一项技能
So if you are performing a task or a skill
就像你正在学习如何跳舞
like you're learning how to dance and you're stepping
踩到别人脚了  或者你动作不稳
on the other person's toes or you're fumbling
或者你没有做对
or you're not getting it right,
这些错误打开了可塑性的可能性
those errors are opening the possibility for plasticity.
如果你在那个时候停下来
If you walk away at that point,
你做出了完全错误的选择
you've made the exact wrong choice.
除非这些错误对你的健康有害
Unless the errors are somehow hazardous to your health
或其他人的幸福  你想继续
or somebody else's wellbeing, you want to continue
以高重复率参与
to engage at a high repetition rate.
这才是真正可以学习的地方
That's really where the learning is possible.
没有错误  大脑不在一个
Without errors, the brain is not in a position
改变自己的位置
to change itself.
错误实际上刺激了额叶皮层网络
Errors actually cue the frontal cortex networks,
我们所说的自上而下的处理和神经调节器
what we call top-down processing and the neuromodulators,
诸如多巴胺、乙酰胆碱和肾上腺素之类的东西
things like dopamine and acetylcholine and epinephrin
这将允许可塑性
that will allow for plasticity.
所以当超级马里奥实验时
So while the super Mario experiment,
迷宫实验只关注产生错误
the maze experiment was only focused on generating errors,
告诉人们这是不对的  请再试一次
telling people that wasn't right, please try again
或者那是不对的  你失去了五分
or that wasn't right, you lost five points.
关键区别在于错误本身
The key distinction is that the errors themselves
提示人们  他们需要
cued people to the fact that they needed
改变某些事情
to change something.
所以如果你想学习一项新技能
So if you're trying to learn a new skill
你搞砸了  你在犯错误
and you're screwing up and you're making mistakes,
你犯的错误越多
the more mistakes you make, the more plastic
你的大脑的可塑性就越强  以至于当你做对了的时候
your brain becomes such that when you get it right,
正确的模式将得到奖励和巩固
that correct pattern will be rewarded and consolidated.
你可以相信它会这样发展
And you can trust that it will
因为正确地表现某事
because the performance of something correctly
与多巴胺的释放
is associated with the release
这种神经调节剂有关
of this neuromodulator dopamine.
多巴胺与渴望和动机有关
Dopamine is involved in craving and motivation.
它涉及很多事情
It's involved in a lot of things,
但它也涉及学习
but it's also involved in learning.
我们将制作一整集关于多巴胺和学习的内容
We will do an entire episode on dopamine and learning
但因为你们中的一些人可能想知道
but because some of you are probably wondering,
这并不意味着仅仅增加你的多巴胺水平
this does not mean that just increasing your dopamine levels
在学习之前会让你学得更快
before learning will allow you to learn faster.
事实上  在学习之前增加你的多巴胺水平
In fact, increasing your dopamine levels before learning
使用药理学的术语来讲  实际上会减少
using pharmacology will actually reduce
所谓的信噪比
what's called the signal to noise.
它将使多巴胺增加
It will make these increases in dopamine
突然出现在你的大脑中  让你意识到
that pop up in your brain that suddenly make you realize,
“哦  我对了”
"Oh, I got that one right."
相对于多巴胺的水平
It will make those smaller relative
它将使这些”声音“变小
to the background levels of dopamine.
多巴胺什么时候该大幅飙升呢
You want a big spike in dopamine when you perform
就是在有正确的运动模式的时候  并且你得犯很多错误
a motor pattern correctly and you want to make lots of errors,
很多很多重复的错误
many, many repetitions of errors
才能达到正确的表现
in order to get to that correct performance.
那么  如果你和大多数人一样  你会这样做
Now, if you're like most people you're going to do this
在某种程度上是随机的
in a way that's somewhat random.
意思是让我们说这是一个网球发球
Meaning let's say it's a tennis serve.
我不会打网球
I can't play tennis,
我想我可能打过两次网球
I think I've probably played tennis twice.
所以如果我把球扔到空中然后击中它
So if I throw the ball up in the air and hit it,
我会弄错  可能会上网
I'm going to get it wrong and probably hit the net,
然后它击中了网
then it hit the net.
那我可能会走太久
Then I'll probably go too long
那么我可能会越过栅栏
then I'll probably go over the fence.
在某些时候  我喜欢认为我会得到正确的
At some point, I like to think I'll get it correct.
多巴胺信号会很大
The dopamine signal for that is going to be quite big
我会想  “好吧  我在那里做了什么？
and I'll think, "Okay, what did I do there?
“我实际上不知道  我没有注意
"I actually don't know, I wasn't paying attention.
“我关注的是
"What I was paying attention to is whether or not
“球是否到了正确的位置
"the ball went to the correct location
“也就是在网的对面”
"on the opposite side of the net."
记住这是一个开环动作
Remember it's an open loop move,
所以我实际上不知道我做对了什么
so I don't actually know what I did correctly.
但你的神经系统会照顾到这一点
But your nervous system will take care of that
如果我在这种情况下完成越来越多
provided I in this case complete more and more
和更多的重复
and more repetitions.
那么  如果我只是提高我的多巴胺水平
Now, if I were to just elevate my basil level of dopamine
通过服用  比如说  1500 毫克 L 酪氨酸
by taking, I don't know, 1500 milligrams L tyrasine
或者什么  那会很糟糕  因为增加
or something, that would be bad because the increase
多巴胺实际上会低得多
in dopamine would actually be much lower.
我们会说增量较小
We would say the delta is smaller.
信噪比更小
The signal to noise is smaller
如果我的多巴胺总体水平非常非常高
if my overall levels of dopamine are very, very high.
所以我实际上会学得不太好
So I'm actually going to learn less well.
所以对于技能学习  运动技能学习
So for skill learning, motor skill learning,
事先增加你的多巴胺水平不是一个好主意
increasing your dopamine levels prior is not a good idea.
它可能有助于激发学习的动力
It might help with motivation to get to the learning
但它不会改善可塑性过程本身
but it's not going to improve the plasticity process itself
它很可能会阻碍它
and it's likely to hinder it.
所以这是非常重要的
And so that's very important.
所以这些错误提示大脑出了问题
So these errors cue the brain that something was wrong
它们开辟了可塑性的可能性
and they open up the possibility for plasticity.
这就是有时被称为框架效应的东西
It's what sometimes called the framing effect,
它勾勒出重要的东西
it frames what's important.
所以我认为这是我们听说过的转变
And so I think this is a shift that we've heard about,
成长型思维是令人难以置信的发现和理论
growth mindset which is the incredible discovery and theory
我的同事 Carol Dweck 在斯坦福大学的实践
and practice of my colleague, Carol Dweck at Stanford.
这与那不同
This is distinct from that.
这不是关于学习的动机
This isn't about motivation to learn,
这是关于你如何实际学习
this is about how you actually learn.
所以关键是指定一个特定的时间块
So the key is designate a particular block of time
你将要进行重复
that you are going to perform repetitions.
所以也许那是 30 分钟  也许那是一个小时
So maybe that's 30 minutes, maybe that's an hour.
争取时间  然后尝试执行
Work for time and then try and perform
你可以安全完成的最大重复次数
the maximum number of repetitions that you can do safely
为你和其他人单位时间
for you and others per unit time.
这将是学习的最佳方式
That's going to be the best way to approach learning
对于大多数事情
for most sessions.
我会谈谈人们可以做的其他事情
I will talk about other things that one can do,
但犯错是关键
but making errors is key.
这不是鸡汤演讲
And this isn't a motivational speech.
我不是说  “哦  去犯错误
I'm not saying, "Oh, go make errors,
“错误对你有好处
"errors are good for you.
“你必须失败才能获胜”
"You have to fail in order to win."
不  你必须失败才能打开
No, you have to fail in order to open up the possibility
可塑性的可能  但你必须失败很多次
of plasticity, but you have to fail many times
在同一个时间段中
within the same session.
而那些失败会引起你的注意
And those failures will cue your attention
到适当的感官事件
to the appropriate sensory events.
那么  有时我们会和教练一起工作
Now, sometimes we're working with a coach.
所以这是对所有教练想说的
And so this is a shout out to all the coaches,
谢谢你做你所做的
thank you for doing what you do.
但是  至少需要有
However, there needs to be at least
至少科学文献是这么说的
what the scientific literature say.
每次训练都需要有一段时间
There needs to be a period of each training session
运动员或任何种类的人
whereby the athlete or the person of any kind
可以简单地注意他们的错误
can simply pay attention to their errors
没有将他们的注意力转移到别的东西上
without their attention being cued to something else.
训练有素的教练会说
A really well-trained coach will say,
“哦  你的肘部摆动得太高了
"Oh, your elbows swinging too high,
“或者你没有抓住球拍
"or you're not gripping the racket
“以适当的方式  ”等等
"in the appropriate way," et cetera.
他们可以看到练习者看不到的东西
They can see things that the practitioner can't see.
当然  这是至关重要的
And of course that's the vitally important.
但是练习者也需要使用
But the practitioner also needs to use
这个错误识别信号
this error recognition signal,
他们需要基本上专注于这个事情
they need to basically focus on something
而 这个错误会告诉他们应该关注什么
and the errors are going to tell them what to focus on.
所以简单地说需要一段时间
So put simply there needs to be a period of time
它只是一个又一个的重复
in which it's just repetition after repetition,
重复后
after repetition.
我想很多人包括教练
I think many people including coaches
害怕坏习惯会根深蒂固
are afraid that bad habits will get ingrained.
虽然这确实是可能的
And while indeed that's possible,
发生这些错误非常重要
it's very important that these errors occur
为了提示注意系统
in order to cue the attentional systems
并为可塑性打开大门
and to open the door for plasticity.
所以如果有人告诉我  “看  我站得有点宽
So if I'm told, "Look, I'm standing a little wide,
“我需要稍微收紧我的站姿”
"I need to tighten up my stance a little bit."
很好  但是我需要产生很多重复
Great, but then I need to generate many repetitions
从那个收紧的站姿
from that tighten stance.
所以如果我经常被外界暗示
So if I'm constantly being cued from the outside
关于我的错误
about what I'm incorrectly,
那不会那么有效
that's not going to be as efficient.
所以对于一些人来说  这些学习时间
So for some people, these learning sessions
可能是 10 分钟  对某些人来说  可能是一个小时
might be 10 minutes, for some people, it might be an hour.
你可以分配的任何东西  因为你的生活方式
Whatever you can allocate because your lifestyles
你是否会有所不同
will vary in your whether or not
你是一名职业运动员  等等会有所不同
you're a professional athlete, et cetera will vary.
你想获得最大的重复次数
You want to get the maximum number of repetitions in
你想犯错误
and you want to make errors.
这允许可塑性
That's allowing for plasticity.
所以科学指出了事实
So science points to the fact
有特定的学习课程顺序
that there's a particular sequencing of learning sessions
这会让你学得更快
that will allow you to learn faster
并保留技能学习
and to retain the skill learning
并且完全按照我刚刚描述的方式去做
and involves doing exactly as I just described,
这是尽可能多的重复
which is getting as many repetitions as you can
在学习过程中  注意你犯的错误
in the learning session, paying attention to the errors that you make.
然后将产生的奖励
And then the rewards that will be generated,
再次  这些是神经化学奖励
again, these are neurochemical rewards
从成功的运动表现开始
from the successful performance of a movement
或近似的成功表现
or the approximate successful performance.
所以也许你的高尔夫挥杆更好但并不完美
So maybe you get the golf swing better but not perfect,
但这仍然会得到回报
but that's still going to be rewarded
与这种神经化学机制
with this neurochemical mechanism.
然后在这个阶段结束后
And then after the session,
你需要做一些非常具体的事情
you need to do something very specific
这没什么
which is nothing.
这是正确的
That's right.
有漂亮的数据描述了  神经元
There are beautiful data describing neurons
在我们的海马体中  我们大脑的这个区域涉及
in our hippocampus, this area of our brain involved
巩固新的记忆
in the consolidation of new memories.
这些数据表明  在睡眠中
Those data points to the fact that in sleep,
有一个神经元对连环动作进行重播
there's a replay of the sequence of neurons
与前一天某些行为有关
that were involved in certain behaviors the previous day
有时在前两天
and sometimes the previous day before that.
不过也有数据显示
However, there are also data that show
在技​​能学习这个阶段之后
that after a skill learning session,
任何类型的运动  只要你不带进来
any kind of motor movement provided you're not bringing in
更多额外的新感官刺激
a lot more additional new sensory stimuli,
有一个你表现正确的连环动作的重播
there's a replay of the motor sequence that you performed correctly
并且有一个消除步骤
and there's an elimination
消除你执行错误的连环动作
of the motor sequences that you performed incorrectly
它们在时间上是向后运行的
and they are run backward in time.
所以要非常清楚这一点  如果我要学习
So to be very clear about this, if I were to learn
新技能或探索新城市
a new skill or navigate a new city
或者让我们保持运动技能
or let's just stay with the motor skill,
比方说罚球、高尔夫挥杆或网球发球
let's say the free-throw or a golf swing or a tennis serve,
跳舞  新手
dance move, novice.
所以我还是会犯很多错误
So I'm still going to make a lot of errors,
不完全明白
don't get it perfectly,
但也许我会好一点
but maybe I get a little bit better
或者我在 1000 次中正确执行了 3 次
or I perform it correctly three times out of 1000.
这听起来像是我可能会做的事情
And it sounds like something I might do
那我可能对自己很欣慰了
and there I'm probably being generous to myself.
在我完成培训课程后
After I finished the training session,
如果我什么都不做  我就不会专注
if I do nothing, I'm not focused
关于一些额外的学习
on some additional learning.
我不会带来很多感官信息
I'm not bringing a lot of sensory information in.
如果我只是坐在那里闭上眼睛
If I just sit there and close my eyes
五到十分钟  甚至一分钟
for five to 10 minutes, even one minute,
大脑开始重放连环动作
the brain starts to replay the motor sequence
对应正确的运动模式
corresponding to the correct pattern movement,
但它向后播放该连环动作
but it plays that sequence backward.
现在为什么它向后播放  我们不知道
Now why it plays it backward, we don't know.
如果我要等到睡觉或不管
If I were to wait until sleep or regardless
那天晚上我睡得很晚的时候
of when I sleep later that night,
连环动作将向前重播
the sequence will be replayed forwards
以正确的顺序
in the proper sequence.
紧接着它向后播放
Immediately afterward it's played a backward
原因尚不清楚
for reasons that are still unclear.
但该连环动作向后重播
But the replay of that sequence backwards
似乎对整合技能学习
appears to be important for the consolidation
很重要
of the skill learning.
那么  这很重要  因为很多人
Now, this is important because many people
正在完成他们的柔术课
are finishing their jujitsu class
或者他们正在完成他们的瑜伽课
or they're finishing their yoga class
或者他们正在完成他们的舞蹈课
or they're finishing their dance class
或者他们正在完成一些技能学习
or they're finishing some skill learning
然后他们立即投入了他们的注意力
and then they're immediately devoting their attention
到别的东西
to something else.
你听到了很多关于可视化的信息
You hear a lot about visualization
我们将讨论可视化
and we are going to talk about visualization.
但在那种对想法的痴迷中
But in the kind of obsession with the idea
我们可以学习东西  只是坐在那里
that we can learn things, just sitting there
闭上眼睛无需做任何动作
with our eyes closed without having to perform a movement,
我们忽略了一些可能更重要的东西
we've overlooked something perhaps even more important
或者至少同样重要
or at least equally important,
就是在技能学习之后  在努力之后
which is after skill learning, after putting effort
闭目静坐
into something, sitting quietly with the eyes closed
一到五到十分钟可以让大脑
for one to five to 10 minutes allows the brain
重播连环动作

这是在 2011 年发表的  但是已经有
And this was published in 2011, but there've been
我描述的一些更新和文献
a number of updates and the literature that I've described
在今天播客的其他部分
in other portions of today's episode
来自最近的文献
come from the more recent literature
例如最近的 2021 年论文
such as the more recent 2021 paper.
所以你有这个基本的学习阶段
So you have this basic learning session
然后一段时间后
and then a period of time afterwards
大脑可以在其中排练它刚刚做了什么
in which the brain can rehearse what it just did.
我们听到了很多关于心理彩排
We hear so much about mental rehearsal
我们总是考虑心理排练
and we always think about mental rehearsal
作为你在训练之前或代替训练所做的事情
as the thing you do before you train or instead of training.
但这是后来的排练
But this is rehearsal that's done afterward
大脑是自动的
where the brain is just automatically
通过连环动作编写脚本
scripting through the sequence.
出于某种原因  这仍然不清楚
And for some reason, that's still not clear
至于为什么会出现这种情况  它会向后运行
as to why this would be the case it runs backward.
然后在睡眠中  它向前跑  当然绝对
Then in sleep, it runs forwards and certainly absolutely,
适当时长的睡眠和优质睡眠
sleep and quality sleep of the appropriate duration,
等等将是重要的
et cetera is going to be important
用于各种学习  包括技能学习
for learning of all kinds, including skill learning.
我们在睡眠上做了整整四集
We did an entire four episodes on sleep
以及如何改善睡眠
and how to get better at sleeping.
这些是一月份的播客
Those are the episodes back in January episodes,
基本上是第一、二、三和四期
essentially one, two, three, and four
甚至可能是第五集  我不记得了
and maybe even episode five, I don't recall.
但是你可以去那里了解一下
But you can go there to find out
所有关于如何更好地睡眠
all about how to get better at sleeping.
现在还有其他培训课程
Now there are other training sessions involved.
我不会在一次训练中  就学到完美的高尔夫挥杆
I'm not going to learn the perfect golf swing
或网球发球或如何跳舞
or the tennis serve or how to dance in one session
我估计你应该也不会
and I doubt you will either.
所以问题是什么时候回来
So the question is when to come back
以及当你回到训练阶段时该怎么做
and what to do when you come back to the training set.
那么  首先  这个原则
Now, first of all, this principle of errors
对错误的关注  并打开可塑性的机会
queuing attention and opening the opportunity
这永远不会改变
for plasticity, that's never going to change.
即便对于技术精湛的人来说  这将是正确的
That's going to be true for somebody who is hyper skilled
谁甚至精通或精通某项技能
who's even has mastery or even virtuosity in a given skill.
记住  当你不擅长某事时
Remember, when you're unskilled at something,
不确定性非常高
uncertainty is very high.
随着你变得更加熟练  确定性就会增加
As you become more skilled, certainty goes up.
然后最终你达到精通水平
Then eventually you achieve levels of mastery
你的表现能力的确定性非常高
where certainty is very very high about your ability
你的确定性和其他人的确定性
to perform, yours certainty en that of other people.
然后是第四种精湛技艺
And then there's this fourth category of virtuosity
也就是有人  也许你自己  会带来不确定性
where somebody, maybe you invites uncertainty
带回到实践中  因为只有那种不确定性
back into the practice because only with that uncertainty,
才能表达你全方位的能力
can you express your full range of abilities
你甚至自己都不知道
which you aren't even aware of
直到不确定性出现
until uncertainty comes into the picture.
我碰巧比较幸运
I happened to have the great privilege
与大浪冲浪者莱尔德·汉密尔顿 (Laird Hamilton) 成为朋友
of being friends with Laird Hamilton, the big wave surfer
他很厉害
who's phenomenal.
我不冲浪  我当然不和莱尔德一起冲浪
I don't surf, I certainly don't surf with Laird,
但是他和另一个他从卢卡·帕图亚开始的人
but he, and another guy that he starts with Luca Patua,
这些家伙  他们是冲浪高手
these guys, they're virtuosos at surfing.
他们不只是想要他们可以掌握的波浪
They don't just want the wave that they can master,
他们想要不确定性
they want uncertainty.
他们正处于实践的关键时刻
They're at the point in their practice
当不确定性出现时
where when uncertainty shows up like a wave
比如  波浪要么太大要么正在以特定的方式移动
that's either so big or is moving in a particular way
它给他们带来了不确定因素
that it brings an element of uncertainty for them
关于他们将要做什么  他们认识到
about what they're going to do that they recognize that
作为表现更好的机会
as the opportunity to perform better
比他们否则
than they would otherwise.
所以他们实际上是在试图消除不确定性
So they're actually trying to eliminate uncertainty.
在开始学习任何技能时
At the beginning of learning any skill
当我们从不确定到熟练再到精通时
and as we approach from uncertain to skilled to mastery,
我们想减少不确定性
we want to reduce uncertainty.
这就是神经系统真正在做的事情
And that's really what the nervous system is doing,
它试图消除错误并磨练
it's trying to eliminate errors and hone in
在正确的轨迹上
on the correct trajectories.
如果你重复很多次
If you perform a lot of repetitions
然后你立即使用一段时间
and then you use a period immediately after,
我们还没有进行命名
we don't really have a name for this,
也许有人会想出它
maybe someone will come up with it
请放在评论区
and put it in the comment section
如果你在 YouTube 上  如果你在 YouTube 上看这个
if you're on YouTube, if you're watching this on YouTube,
给这个学习后  属于大脑的空闲时间取个名字
a name for this post learning kind of idle time for the brain.
大脑根本就是一个偶像  它实际上是脚本
The brain is an idol at all, it's actually scripting
所有这些相反的东西允许更深入的学习
all these things in reverse that allow for deeper learning
和更快的学习
and more quick learning.
但如果我们用其他东西填充它
But if we fill that with other things,
如果我们专注于我们的手机或者我们专注于
if we are focused on our phones or we're focused
在学习其他东西时
on learning something else,
我们专注于我们的表现
we're focusing on our performance,
那不会很好地为我们服务
that's not going to serve us well,
至少它不会很好地为技能学习服务
it's at least it's not going to serve the skill learning well.
所以  如果你对更快速的技能学习感兴趣
So please, if you're interested in more rapid skill learning
尝试这种方法   它们可能非常强大
try introducing these sessions, they can be quite powerful.
然后在随后的阶段中
And then on subsequent sessions,
大概是在睡了一夜之后
presumably after a night's sleep
或者也许你每天做两个阶段
or maybe you're doing two sessions a day,
虽然一天两个学习阶段还挺多的
although two sessions a day is going to be a lot
对于大多数人来说  除非你是专业人士
for most people, unless you're a professional
或高水平运动员  随后的阶段
or a high-level athlete, the subsequent sessions
是你表达前一个阶段收获的地方
are where you get to express the gains
这个阶段你会表现得很好
of the previous session, where you get to perform well,
大部分情况下  即使它只是微妙的
presumably more often even if it's just subtle.
有时性能会下降
Sometimes there'll be a decrease in performance,
但大多数时候你会表现得更好
but most often you're going to perform better
在随后的训练阶段中
on subsequent and subsequent training sessions.
并且有机会专心致志
And there is the opportunity to devote attention
以非常具体的方式  而不仅仅是让错误告诉你
in very specific ways, not just let the errors inform you
让把你的注意力放在哪里
where to place your attention, but rather to direct
而是引导你对运动特定元素的看法
your perception to particular elements of the movement
以进一步加快学习速度
in order to accelerate learning further.
所以要非常清楚  因为我认识你们很多人
So to be very clear, 'cause I know many of you
对具体工具方法感兴趣
are interested in concrete protocols.
不仅仅是第一个阶段中  你让错误
It's not just that you would only let errors
提示你把注意力放哪里
cue your attention on the first session.
你可以在一个或五个阶段中这样做
You might do that for one session or five sessions,
这不一定
is going to depend.
但是一旦你熟悉了一些东西
But once you're familiar with something
而且你每隔一段时间就会表现得很好
and you're performing it well every once in a while,
你每隔一段时间就会做得更好
you're accomplishing it better every once in a while,
然后你就可以开始引起你的注意了
then you can start to cue your attention
以非常刻意的方式
in very deliberate ways.
因此问题就变成了
And the question therefore becomes
提示你注意什么
what to cue your attention to.
好消息是这并不重要
And the good news is it doesn't matter.
有一组漂亮的实验已经完成
There is a beautiful set of experiments that have been done
查看在钢琴上弹奏的琴键连环动作
looking at sequences of keys being played on a piano.
这是几年前发表的作品
This is work that was published just a couple of years ago.
现在其实有好几篇论文
There are actually several papers now
专注于此
that are focused on this.
其中之一于 2018 年出版
One of them was published in 2018.
这是来自 Claudia Lappe 及其同事 LAPPE
This is from Claudia Lappe and colleagues, L-A-P-P-E.
她做了一些非常好的工作  其中谈到
She's done some really nice work, which talks about
音高反馈的影响
the influence of pitch feedback
关于学习运动时间和顺序
on learning of motor timing and sequencing.
这是用钢琴完成的
And this was done with piano
但它也适用于运动表现
but it carries over to athletic performance as well.
所以我要向你描述这项研究
So I'm going to describe the study to you,
但在我描述它之前
but before I describe it, what is so interesting
我想让你知道  这项研究中非常有趣的是
about this study that I want you to know about
事实证明
is that it turns out it doesn't matter so much
你在学习阶段中注意什么  这并不重要
what you pay attention to during the learning sequence
只要它与你正在进行的运动行为有关
provided it's something related to the motor behavior that you're performing.
这似乎不可思议
That seems incredible.
我不擅长网球发球
I'm not good at a tennis serve.
所以如果我已经完成了  比如说一千次重复
So if I've done let's say a thousand repetitions
网球发球
of the tennis serve.
也许我做对了三到十次
Maybe I got it right three to 10 times.
现在我把自己想得更好了
Now I'm being even more generous with myself.
我做这个训练后阶段
And I do this post-training session
让我的大脑闲置并睡个好觉
where I let my brain idle and I get some good sleep
然后回来  现在我又开始产生错误了
and I come back and now I start generating errors again,
大概或希望更少的错误
presumably or hopefully fewer errors,
但我决定要引起我的注意
but I decide I'm going to cue my attention
非常具体的东西  比如可能
to something very specific, like maybe how tightly
我拿着球拍有多紧 或者可能是我的站姿
I'm holding the racket or maybe it's my stance,
或者也许是当我击球时
or maybe it's whether or not I rotate my right shoulder in
我是否旋转了我的右肩
as I hit the ball across.
我瞎说的  我又不打网球
And I'm making this up, again I don't play tennis.
原来只要是在整个阶段期间
Turns out that it as long as it's the same thing
关注同一个东西  学习速度将会加快
throughout the session, learning is accelerated.
稍后我将解释为什么这有意义
And I'll explain why this make sense in a moment.
但要明确地说  你能够而且应该要
But just to be really clear, you can and one should
用你的注意力来引导你
use your powers of attention to direct your attention
在运动特定方面的注意力
to particular aspects of a motor movement
一旦你熟悉了运动的总体主题
once you're familiar with the general theme of the movement.
但你究竟关注什么并不重要
But what you pay attention to exactly is not important.
重要的是你要注意到
What's important is that you pay attention
一件特定的事情
to one specific thing.
所以 Claudia Lappe 和同事们展示的
So what Claudia Lappe and colleagues showed
是如果人们试图学习一系列琴键
was that if people are trying to learn a sequence of keys
在钢琴上  有多种形式的反馈
on the piano, there are multiple forms of feedback.
有错误信号  例如
There are error signals if for instance,
他们听到一段音乐  然后他们被告知
they hear a piece of music and then they're told
以特定顺序按下按键
to press the keys in a particular sequence
和发出的噪音  发出钢琴的声音
and the noise that comes out, the sound that comes out
听起来不像他们刚听到的那首歌
of the piano does not sound like the song they just heard.
所以  而不是  在这里  原谅我
So instead of, and here, forgive me
因为我既不会音乐  也不会唱歌
because I'm neither musical, nor can I sing.
但是他们听到的不是哒  哒  哒  哒
But instead of dah, dah dah, dah, they hear that,
哒哒哒哒哒
dah, dah dah, dah
然后当他们弹的时候
and then instead when they play.
如果是我  听起来像是
If it were me, it sounds something like,
......  这听起来不对
dah, dah dah [indistinct], it wouldn't sound right.
听起来不太对  因为我弹的顺序错了
It wouldn't sound right, because I likely got the sequence
或者我按键太用力了
wrong, or I was pressing too hard on the keys
或太轻的键  等等
or too lightly on the keys, et cetera.
他们展示的是如果他们只是指导人们
What they showed was if they just instruct people
关于按下按键的正确顺序
about the correct sequence to press on the keys,
实际上  返回什么声音并不重要
it actually doesn't matter what sound comes back,
只要它是正确的声音或相同的声音
provided it's the correct sound or it's the same sound.
好的  下面是实验
All right, so here's the experiment.
他们让人们按下这些键
They had people press on these keys
这是一架典型的钢琴  它产生了
and it was a typical piano and it generated
将产生的特定声音连环动作
the particular sequence of sounds that would be generated
通过按下钢琴上的琴键
by pressing the keys on the piano.
或者他们在这种情况下修改了键盘或钢琴
Or they modified the keyboard in this case or piano
这样当人们按下按键时
such that when people pressed on the keys,
一个随机的音调播放了不同的音调
a random tone different tones were played
每次他们按下按键
each time they pressed on the keys.
所以听起来很疯狂  听起来像噪音
So it sounded crazy, it sounded like noise,
但运动顺序是一样的
but the motor sequence was the same.
或者他们每次都播放一个单一的音调
Or they had a single tone that was played every time
他们按下了一个琴键   工作或任务
they pressed a key and the job or the task of the subject
只是按正确的顺序按下了按键
was just oppressed the keys in the proper sequence.
所以  其实不是......
So instead of dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,
而是 ......
it it was just dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt.
而不是哒  哒  哒  哒  哒  哒
Instead of dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,
是哒  哒  哒  哒  哒
it's dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
我连音都发不准
It's even hard for me to say it in even a tone,
但你懂我什么意思
but you get the idea.
所以一个单一的音调  想想门铃正在响起
So a singular tone, just think a doorbell being rung
每次按下这个键都会很烦人
with each press of the key will be really annoying.
但事实证明  运动学习的速度
But it turns out that the rate to motor learning
是一样的  无论他们是否得到反馈
was the same, whether or not they were getting feedback
那是准确的钢琴键
that was accurate to the keys of the piano
或者它是否是一个恒定的音调
or whether or not it was a constant tone.
表现很糟糕  学习率
Performance was terrible and the rates of learning
如果他们恢复随机音调  那就会非常难听
were terrible if they were getting random tones back.
所以这意味着学习弹钢琴
So what this means is that learning to play the piano
至少在这些早期阶段
at least at these early stages
实际上只是关于生成运动命令
is really just about generating the motor commands.
不是要注意声音
It's not about paying attention to the sound
那是从钢琴里传出来的
that's coming out of the piano.
这是有道理的 因为当我们是初学者时
And this makes sense because when we are beginners,
我们正在努力将注意力集中在
we are trying to focus our attention on the things
我们可以控制的事情上
that we can control.
如果你考虑这个  如果你把这个概念化
And if you think about this, if you conceptualize this,
按下钢琴上的琴键并注意
pressing the keys on the piano and paying attention
发出的声音有两件事
to the sounds that are coming out are two things.
所以这意味着随着你深入
So what this means is that as you get deeper
深入练习
and deeper into a practice,
只关注运动执行可能是有益的
focusing purely on the motor execution can be beneficial.
那么  这将在开环类型的运动中更难做到
Now, this is going to be harder to do
因为你会得到反馈
with open loop type things where you're getting feedback.
我猜是开环的一个很好的例子
I guess a good example of open loop
就是后空翻的尝试
would be the attempt at a back flip.
如果你弄错了  你会立刻知道
If you get it wrong, you will immediately know,
如果你做对了  你会立即知道
if you get it right, you'll immediately know.
请不要出去尝试做后空翻
Please don't go out and try and do a back flip
在坚实的地面上  甚至在蹦床上
on the solid ground, or even on a trampoline
如果你不知道你在做什么
if you don't know what you're doing
因为很可能你会弄错
because very likely you'll get it wrong
你会受伤
and you'll get injured.
但如果它是闭环的东西
But if it's something that is closed loop
在那里你可以一次又一次地重复  一次又一次
where you can repeat again and again, and again and again,
这是有利的  因为你可以执行
that is advantageous because you can perform
多次重复  你就可以开始集中注意力
many many repetitions and you can start to focus
或学会集中注意力
or learn to focus your attention
只是在运动模式上
just on the pattern of movement.
换句话说  你可以学习弹钢琴
In other words, you can learn to play the piano
一样快  甚至更快
just as fast or maybe even faster
只关注你移动手指的顺序
by just focusing on the sequence that you are moving
你的手指  而不是声音的反馈
your digits, your fingers and not the feedback.
那么  我确定会有音乐老师
Now, I'm sure there are music teachers out there
钢琴老师会反对
and piano teachers that are screaming,
“不  你会破坏练习
"No you're going to ruin the practice
“我们所有人都深深植根于我们的脑海中
"that all of us have embedded in our minds
“还有我们的学生”
"and in our students."
我同意  在某些时候你需要开始
And I agree, at some point you need to start
收集反馈
including feedback about whether or not
音乐听起来是否正确的反馈
things sound correct.
但是技能学习的好处之一
But one of the beauties of skill learning
是你可以选择参数化它
is that you can choose to parameterize it,
这意味着你可以选择只关注运动连环动作
meaning you can choose to just focus on the motor sequence
或者只专注于返回的声音
or just focus on the sounds that are coming back
然后整合这些
and then integrate those.
所以我们听到了很多关于分块的信息
And so we hear a lot about chunking,
关于将事物分解成它们的组成部分
about breaking things down into their component parts.
但技能学习的最大挑战之一
But one of the biggest challenges for skill learning
是知道将注意力放在哪里
is knowing where to place your attention.
所以再次提醒  我们正在建立一个工具方法
So to dial out again, we're building a protocol
在这一集中  早期的阶段
across this episode, early sessions,
也许是第一个  也许是前 10 个
maybe it's the first one, maybe it's the first 10,
也许是前100
maybe it's the first 100.
这取决于你打包的重复次数
It depends on how many repetitions you're packing in.
但在最初的阶段期间
But during those initial sessions,
关键是要犯很多错误才能让奖励过程
the key is to make many errors to let the reward process
控制可塑性  让错误打开可塑性
govern the plasticity, let the errors open the plasticity.
然后在学习阶段结束之后
And then after the learning sessions,
让大脑闲着
to let the brain go idle
至少在短时间内
at least for a short period of time
当然  为了最大限度地睡眠
and of course, to maximize sleep.
当你开始合并更多阶段时
As you start incorporating more sessions,
你开始获得一些技能水平
you start to gain some skill level,
学习利用和集中注意力
learning to harness and focus your attention
在动作的某些特征上
on particular features of the movement
独立于奖励和反馈
independent of the rewards and the feedback.
所以奖励不再是来自钢琴的音调
So the reward is no longer in the tone coming from the piano
或者你是否正确击中目标
or whether or not you struck the target correctly
而只是运动   集中在你的
but simply the motor movement focusing your,
例如在飞镖投掷中  在你手臂的动作上
for instance in a dart throw, on the action of your arm.
那就是在运动模式中深深嵌入可塑性的方式
That is embedding the plasticity in the motor pattern
这就是
most deeply, that's what's been shown
通过科学文献所表明的
by the scientific literature.
我确定肯定有教练和老师
I'm sure there are coaches and teachers out there
这将完全不同意我的观点  这很好
that will entirely disagree with me and that's great.
请让我知道你更喜欢什么
Please let me know what you prefer,
让我知道你认为这是错误的地方
let me know where you think this is wrong
它很少发生  但让我知道你的想法
and it rarely happens, but let me know where you think
这也可能是对的
this might be right as well.
所以我们打破了学习过程
So we're breaking the learning process down
进入其组成部分
into its component parts.
随着我们越来越熟练
As we get more and more skilled,
意思是我们犯的错误越来越少
meaning as we make fewer and fewer errors
每单位时间的给定一个阶段  这就是注意力
per a given session per unit time, that's when attention
可以开始从一项功能迁移
can start to migrate from one feature
例如一个习惯动作到另一个特征
such as the motor sequence to another feature
这可能是一个人的站姿
which is perhaps one's stance and another sequence,
另一个联动的组成部分  这将是结果
component of the sequence, which would be the result
这是一个试验到试验的基础上
that's one getting on a trial to trial basis.
所以每次都要换
So changing it up each time.
所以也许我送的是网球
So maybe I served the tennis ball
我专注于球落地的位置
and I'm focusing on where the ball lands
然后我专注于速度
and then I'm focusing on the speed,
然后我专注于我的抓地力  然后我专注于我的站姿
then I'm focusing on my grip, then I'm focusing on my stance
一次接着一次
from trial to trial.
但直到我们掌握了核心运动
But until we've mastered the core motor movements
也就是一个个阶段学下来
which has done session to session,
至少根据文献
that at least according to the literature
我可以访问这里  似乎不是最理想的
that I have access to here, seems to be suboptimal.
所以希望这开始变得有意义
So hopefully this is starting to make sense,
这就是上运动神经元之间的这些连接
which is that these connections between upper motor neurons,
下运动神经元和中枢模式发生器
lower motor neurons and central pattern generators,
你不能一下子捕获所有
you can't attack them all at once.
你不能尝试一下子改变它们
You can't try and change them all at once.
所以我们正在做的是我们正在分解事情
And so what we're doing is we're breaking things down
进入它们的组成部分
into their component parts.
你们中的一些人可能想知道运动的速度
Some of you may be wondering about speed of movement.
有一些数据  这意味着那里有一些不错的论文
There are some data, meaning some decent papers out there
显示超慢动作
showing that ultra slow movements,
基本上以慢动作进行动作
performing a movement essentially in slow motion
可以有利于提高技能学习率
can be beneficial for enhancing the rate of skill learning.
然而  至少从我对文献的阅读来看
However, at least from my read of the literature,
超慢动作
it appears that ultra slow movements should be performed
应该要在已经获得一定程度的熟练程度之后再做
after some degree of proficiency has already been gained
在那个特定的运动中
in that particular movement.
这不是我想的方式
Now that's not the way I would have thought about it.
我会想  好吧  如果你正在学习如何做
I would have thought, well, if you're learning how to do
武术中的正确踢腿或出拳
a proper kick or a paunch in martial arts
或者一开始超慢动作的东西
or something that ultra slow movements at first
将成为人们最好的
are going to be the way that one can best learn
学习如何进行运动的方式
how to perform a movement
然后你只是逐渐提高速度
and then you just gradually increase the speed.
事实证明并非如此
It turns out that's not the case
我可能应该知道这一点
and I probably should have known that.
你也应该知道  因为事实证明
And you should probably know that because it turns out
当你做超慢动作时
that when you do ultra slow movements,
有两样东西对你不可用
two things aren't available to you.
一是本体反馈  它不准确
One is the proprioceptive feedback is not accurate
因为四肢的快速运动
because of fast movements of limbs are very different
相比起四肢的缓慢运动  是非常不同的
than slow movements of limbs.
所以你没有机会
So you don't get the opportunity
建立本体感觉反馈
to build in the proprioceptive feedback.
但它不起作用的另一个原因
But the other reason why it doesn't work
是它太准确了  你不会产生错误
is that it's too accurate, you don't generate errors.
所以我能找到的数据
And so the data that I was able to find
表明非常缓慢的运动可能是有益的
show that very slow movements can be beneficial
如果一个人已经精通一种练习
if one is already proficient in a practice,
但开始时动作非常缓慢
but very slow movements at the beginning
不要让你学得更快
don't allow you to learn more quickly
因为你永远不会产生错误
because you never generate errors
因此大脑不会  它不会接受改变
and therefore the brain doesn't, it's not open for change.
可以这么说  可塑性的窗口从未打开过
The window for plasticity has never swung open, so to speak.
所以让我们回到这个主题
So it brings us back to this theme
错误开启可塑性
that errors allow for plasticity,
正确的动作表现
correct performance of movements
或半正确的动作表现
or semi correct performance of movements, cues the synapses
刺激  在需要改变的大脑区域和脊髓回路中的突触
in the brain areas and spinal circuits that need to change.
然后这些变化发生在
And then those changes occur in the period
在技​​能学习之后的紧接着的阶段  和睡眠的时候
immediately after skill learning and in sleep.
所以超慢动作可能是有益的
So super slow movements can be beneficial
前提是你已经掌握了一些技能
once you already have some proficiencies.
所以这可能是站在你的客厅里
So this might be standing in your living room
并且只是在超慢动作中
and just in ultra slow motion,
执行你的网球发球  学习
performing your tennis serve, learning to,
或考虑如何调整肘部
or thinking about how you're adjusting your elbow
你的手臂和轨迹正是你被教导的
and your arm and the trajectory exactly how you were taught
你的网球教练
by your tennis coach.
但是从一开始就试图以这种方式学习
But trying to learn it that way from the outset
似乎不是学习技能的最佳方式
does not appear to be the best way to learn a skill.
你应该什么时候开始引入慢速学习？
When should you start to introduce slow learning?
嗯  显然和你的教练谈谈这个
Well, obviously talk to your coaches about this,
但如果你这样做是为了消遣
but if you're doing this recreationally
或者你们没有教练  我知道你们很多人都没有
or you don't have a coach, I realize many of you don't.
我做任何事都没有教练
I don't have a coach for anything that I do.
我都是
I'm going to have just navigating it
通过使用科学文献
by using the scientific literature.
看来  一旦你达到成功率
It appears that once you're hitting success rates
大约 25% 或 30%  这就是超慢动作
of about 25 or 30%, that's where the super slow movements
可以开始有益的地方
can start to be beneficial.
但是如果你仍然以一定的速度做事
But if you're still performing things at a rate
5% 或 10% 正确  其余都是错误
of five or 10% correct and the rest are errors,
那么  超慢动作
then the super slow movements
可能不会给你带来那么多好处
are probably not going to benefit you that much.
超慢动作也不是真的适用
Also super slow movements are not really applicable
对很多事情
to a lot of things.
例如  你可以用超级慢动作想象投掷飞镖
For instance, you could imagine throwing a dart
但如果你真的尝试超级慢的
super slow motion, but if you actually try
扔出一个真正的飞镖
and throw an actual dart,
显然  飞镖会掉到地上
the dart's just going to fall to the floor, obviously.
所以有很多东西  比如棒球挥棒
So there are a number of things like baseball bat swing
你可以用超慢动作练习
which you can practice in super slow motion.
但是如果你尝试用真正的棒球来做到这一点
But if you try and do that with an actual baseball
或垒球或类似的东西
or softball or something like that,
那不会给你任何反馈
that's not going to give you any kind of feedback
关于它的效果如何
about how effective it was.
所以超慢动作或减速动作
So super slow movements or a decelerated movement
确实有一定的作用  但必须得到你比较精通的情况下
has its place but once you're already performing things
比如25% 到 30% 的成功率
reasonably well like maybe 25 to 30% success rate.
我试过这个  实际上  我试过这么打篮球
And I've tried this, I actually, I struggle with basketball
无论出于何种原因  我的罚球都很糟糕
for whatever reason and my free throw is terrible.
所以我用超慢动作练习罚球
So I practiced free throws in super slow motion
我每次都做的非常棒
and I nailed them every time,
唯一问题是没有球
the problem is there's no ball.
你们中的一些人已经有相当程度的熟练程度
Some of you already have a fair degree of proficiency,
在特定实践或运动或乐器的技能上
of skill in a given practice or sport or instrument.
如果你在这种高级中级
And if you're in this sort of advanced intermediate
或对某项技能有高级熟练程度
or advanced levels of proficiency for something,
有一种方法  可以在文献中找到有趣的支持数据
there is a practice that you can find interesting data for
这些都涉及节拍
in the literature, which involves metronoming.
所以你会意识到这与生成重复有关
So this you'll realize relates to generating repetitions
它与音调实验有关
and it relates to the tone experiment
你的注意力在哪里并不重要
where it doesn't really matter what your attention
只要你在做动作
is cued to as long as you are performing
有非常多的重复  就会被提示
many many reps of the motor sequence.
你可以使用节拍器  显然音乐家会这样做
You can use a metronome and obviously musicians do this,
但运动员也可以做到这一点
but athletes can do this too.
你可以使用节拍器来设置节奏
You can use a metronome to set the cadence
你的重复
of your repetitions.
现在对于游泳者来说  实际上有一个设备
Now for swimmers, there's actually a device.
我可以在网上找到
I was able to find online,
我忘记了品牌名称是什么
I forgot what the brand name was
这不是重点  但实际上是这样
and that's not what this is about, but that actually goes
在你的泳帽里  可以提示你
in the swim cap that can cue you
当你需要执行另一次游动时
to when you need to perform another stroke.
对于跑步者  还有其他节拍器类型的设备
And for runners, there are other metronome type devices
通过耳机或房间里的声音
that through headphones or through a tone in the room
如果你在室内或跑步机上跑步
if you're running indoors or on a treadmill
会提示你  什么时候需要
we'll cue you to when you basically
你需要抬起你的脚后跟
you need to lift your heels.
如果你这样做  运动员会发现什么
And if you do that, what athletes find
他们可以进行更多的重复
is they can perform more repetitions,
他们可以产生更多的输出  你可以提高速度
they can generate more output, you can increase speed.
许多非常有趣的事情
A number of really interesting things are being done
都与听觉节拍有关
with auditory metronoming.
然后我现在参与了一些工作
And then I'm involved in a little bit of work now
希望我能向你汇报
that hopefully I'll be able to report back to you
关于使用频闪节拍器
about using stroboscopic metronoming.
所以实际上改变了视觉环境的速度
So actually changing the speed of the visual environment.
这些是有趣的实验  基本上改变了
These are fun experiments, basically changing
一个人对他们在空间中移动的速度的看法
one's perception of how fast they're moving through space
通过使用视觉系统
by playing with the visual system,
将来讨论的东西
something for a future discussion.
但是你可以开始使用听觉节拍
But you can start to use auditory metronoming
用于在单位时间内产生更多运动
for generating more movements per unit time
并产生更多的错误  从而获得更多的成功
and generating more errors and therefore more successes
和更多的神经可塑性
and more neuroplasticity.
有许多不同的应用程序
There are a number of different apps out there.
我找到了几个免费的应用程序  你可以在其中进行设置
I found several free apps where you can set in
节拍器速度  或者它可能是滴答  滴答
a metronome pace, or it might be tick, tick,
滴答  滴答  滴答  滴答
tick, tick, tick, tick.
对于大多数事情来说  这有点快
That's a little fast for most things,
但你可以想象这是飞镖
but you can imagine if this were darts
或者这是高尔夫挥杆  它可能是滴答声
or this were golf swings that it might be tick,
滴答  滴答  滴答或更像滴答  滴答的东西
tick, tick, tick or something more like tick, tick.
每次节拍器响起时  你挥杆
And every time the metronome goes, you swing.
每次节拍器响起  你就扔一个飞镖
Every time the metronome goes, you throw a dart.
事实上  有一些疯狂的实验
Actually there's some wild experiments out there.
你知道   有一个世界叠杯锦标赛
You know there's a world championship of cup stacking.
我看到有一位年轻女士可以拿走所有这些杯子
There's a young lady who I saw could take all these cups
摊开在桌子上  基本上只是把它们叠起来
spread out on a table and basically just stack them
以最少的次数进入完美的金字塔
into the perfect pyramid in the least amount of times
所有的观众都疯狂了
and all the kids go wild.
这是我从未想过要追求的东西
This is something I'd never thought to pursue
坦白说永远不会追求
and frankly never will pursue
除非我的生活出于某种原因依赖于它
unless my life depends on it for some reason,
但它确实令人印象深刻
but it's really impressive.
如果你看看这个连环动作
And if you look at the sequence
因为这些都被记录下来了
'cause these have been recorded,
你可以在 YouTube 上查一下
you can look this up on YouTube.
你会发现这些专业的叠杯机
What you'll find is that these expert cup stackers,
这只是关于消除错误
it's just all about error elimination.
但它们是两个节拍和听觉线索
But they're two metronomic and auditory cues
实际上可以提示他们更快地拿起杯子
can actually cue them to pick up the cups faster
比他们通常会并学会这样做
than they would ordinarily and to learn to do that.
你可以为任何事情执行此操作
You can do this for anything.
我觉得叠杯可能不是什么
I think cup stacking is probably not a skill
你们中的大多数人都有兴趣去学的技能
most of you are interested in doing,
但对于任何技能  如果你弄清楚速度是多少
but for any skill, if you figure out at what rate
你在单位时间内进行重复
you are performing repetitions per unit time
你想稍微增加一点
and you want to increase that slightly,
你可以设置一个稍微快一点的节拍器
you set a metronome which is slightly faster
比你目前的速度  你刚刚开始产生
than your current rate and you just start generating
更多的重复
more repetitions.
那么  其中有趣的并且很酷的是
Now what's interesting about this and is cool
它与之前实验有关
is it relates back to the experiment
来自 Lappe 和他的同事们  也就是说你的关注点
from Lappe and colleagues, which is your attention
现在已经适应了音调  节拍器
is now harnessed to the tone, to the metronome,
不一定是你在做什么
not necessarily to what you're doing
在运动方面
in terms of the motor movement.
所以你真的需要一点熟练度
And so really you need a bit of proficiency.
同样  这适用于处于中级的人
Again, this is for people who are in intermediate
或中高级或高级
or advanced intermediate or advanced.
但你本质上所做的是你在创造
But what you're essentially doing is you're creating
一种外部压力  一种偶然性  这样你就会产生
an outside pressure, a contingency so that you generate,
再次  更多错误
again, more errors.
所以这都是关于你得到的错误
So it's all about the errors that you get.
那么  这些不是所有杯子都翻倒的错误
Now, these aren't errors where all the cups tumble
或者你必须停下来或者你跟不上
or you have to stop or you can't keep up,
你必须稍微调整一下节奏
you have to set the pace just a little bit
超出你目前所能做的
beyond what you currently can do.
当你这样做时  你基本上是在强迫
And when you do that, you're essentially forcing
神经系统会犯错误并纠正错误
the nervous system to make errors and correct the errors
这个阶段之中
inside of the session.
我觉得这很有趣  因为它意味着的是
I find this really interesting because what it means
你拥有的感官知觉
is, again you've got sensory perception,
你在关注什么
what you're paying attention to,
本体感觉  四肢在哪  以及运动神经元
proprioception where your limbs are and the motor neurons
在你的上下运动神经元
in your upper lower motor neurons
和中央模式发生器中
and central pattern generators.
而你无法关注
And you can't pay attention to,
“嗯  它们是我的上运动神经元
"Well, they're my upper motor neurons,
“它们是我的下运动神经元”
"they're my lower motor neurons."
别想了  你不会那样做
Forget that, you're not going to do that.
你不能太关注你的本体感受
You can't pay attention to your proprioception too much.
那将是超级慢动作
That would be the super slow motion
将是本体感受
would be the proprioception.
但是你必须把注意力集中在一些事情上
But you have to harness your attention to something.
如果你利用你的注意力
And if you harness your attention
为了这个外部的偶然性  这个节拍器
to this outside contingency, this metronome
一停不停的  现在去  现在去  现在去
that's firing off and saying, now go, now go, now go.
不仅可以增加重复次数  错误和成功的次数
Not only can you increase the number of repetitions, errors
但出于某种原因  我们不知道为什么
and successes, but for some reason and we don't know why,
节拍器音调的规律节奏
the regular cadence of the tone of the metronome
以及你正在锚定你的动作的事实
and the fact that you are anchoring your movements
对一些外力  对一些外部压力或提示
to some external force, to some external pressure
似乎能加速可塑性
or cue seems to accelerate the plasticity
以及技能的变化和获得
and the changes and the acquisition of skills
超出如果你只是做同样的数字会是什么
beyond what it would be if you just did the same number
没有外部压力的重复
of repetitions without that outside pressure.
我们不知道确切的机制是什么
We don't know exactly what the mechanism is.
大概是神经化学  好像有什么东西
Presumably it's neurochemical, like there's something
关于跟上计时器或步伐
about keeping up with a timer or with a pace
这大概是  在这里我是在推测啊
that presumably and I'm speculating here,
导致特定化学物质的释放
causes the release of particular chemicals.
但我觉得这真的很酷
But I think it's really cool.
节拍器  它们完全不贵
Metronomes, they're totally inexpensive,
至少你在水之外使用的那些
at least the ones that you use outside of water
非常便宜
are very inexpensive.
你可以找到这些免费的应用程序
You can find these free apps,
你可以使用音乐节拍器
you can use a musical metronome.
所以节拍器也是一个强大的工具
So metronomes are a powerful tool as well
特别是对于速度工作
in particular for speed work.
所以对于短跑或游泳或跑步
So for sprinting or swimming or running
目标是产生更多的重复动作
where the goal is to generate more strokes
或更有效的动作或更多的步骤  等等
or more efficient strokes or more steps, et cetera.
节拍器的速度
The rate of the metronome obviously
将是非常重要的
is going to be very important.
有时你试图延长你的步幅
Sometimes you're trying to lengthen your stride,
有时你想减少划水次数
sometimes you're trying to take fewer strokes
但例如在游泳池中继续漂浮
but glide further in the pool for instance.
但偶尔的价值
But the value of occasionally
只是重复的次数  划动的数量
just the number of repetitions, the number of strokes
或每单位时间的步数等等也是
or steps, et cetera per unit time is also
你正在训练中央模式生成器
that you're training the central pattern generators
以更高的速度运行
to operate at that higher speed.
其中一项运动对我来说有点有趣
One of the sports has kind of interesting to me
是速度步行
is speed walking.
这不是我参与或计划参与的
It's not one I engage in or ever planned to engage in,
但如果你曾经尝试过真正加速步行
but if you've ever tried to really speed walk,
实际上很难走得非常快
it's actually difficult to walk very very fast
并且不变成小跑
without breaking into a run.
所有动物都有这些交叉点
All animals have these kinds of crossover points
也就是
where you go.
比如说马  就像它们小跑
I think with horses it's like it was that they trot,
然后疾驰  或者接下来的事情
then they gallop on, or what's the next thing.
显然  我对马一无所知
Clearly, I don't know anything about horses
除了它们很漂亮而且我非常喜欢它们
except that they're beautiful and I liked them very much.
但它们将动作分成了多种不同的步伐
But they break into a different kind of stride.
那是因为你转移了
And that's because you shift over
到了不同的中央模式发生器
to different central pattern generators.
所以当你走路或马走得很慢时
So when you're walking or a horse is moving very slowly
然后它开始慢跑
and then it breaks into a jog
然后全力冲刺或疾驰
and then into a full sprint or gallop for the horse,
你实际上是在参与不同的
you're actually engaging different
中央模式发生器
central pattern generators.
还有那些中央模式发生器
And those central pattern generators
总是有它们最愿意去发挥作用的速度范围
always have a range of speeds that they're happiest to function at.
所以为了速度目的而使用节拍器
So with the metronoming for speed purposes,
你所做的是你基本上可以带来
what you do is you can basically bring the activity
那些中央模式发生器的活动
of those central pattern generators
进入它们的上限  甚至可能扩大它们的范围
into their upper range and maybe even extend their range.
还有一个迷人的生物学
And there's a fascinating biology
中央模式生成器如何协同工作
of how central pattern generators work together.
有中央模式生成器等的耦合
There's coupling of central pattern generators, et cetera
以达到最大速度等
in order to achieve maximum speeds and et cetera.
这是更高级的主题
It's a topic for a kind of an advanced session.
科斯塔喜欢这些内容  他在叫
Costa loves this topic, he just barked.
他非常喜欢这些内容  他又叫了
And he loves it so much, he barked again.
无论如何  节拍器是一个强大的工具
In any event, the metronome is a powerful tool,
再次申明  主要是为了更进阶的练习者
again for more advanced practitioners
或高级中级练习者
or for advanced intermediate practitioners.
但它很有趣  因为它把我们带回了一个重点
But it's interesting because it brings back
我们还在学习的时候
the point that what we put our attention to
注意力关注在哪里很重要
while we're still learning is important
关注在一个地方
to the extent that it's on one thing
至少是每次练习的当下  或者连续的练习中
at least for the moment or trial to trial,
但我们关注的可能是外在的
but that what we focus our attention on can be external,
它可以是内部的  最终是技能学习
it can be internal and ultimately the skill learning
是所有一切都汇集在一起​​的地方
is where all that is brought together.
那么让我们来谈谈技能学习发生的地方
So let's talk about where skill learning occurs
在神经系统中
in the nervous system.
然后我要给你一个真的
And then I'm going to give you a really,
我认为是一个非常酷的工具
what I think is a really cool tool
可以增加灵活性和运动范围
that can increase flexibility and range of motion
基于这个特定的大脑区域
based on this particular brain area.
这是我使用的一个工具  当我第一次听说时
It's a tool that I used and when I first heard about,
我不相信会起作用
I did not believe would work.
这不是什么玄学  这实际上是
This is not a hack, this is actually anchored deeply
在我们都拥有的特定大脑区域的生物学中 根深蒂固的东西
in the biology of a particular brain region that we all have
它的意思是迷你大脑
whose meaning is mini brain.
还有我们都有的那个迷你大脑
And that mini brain that we all have
被称为你的小脑
is called your cerebellum.
小脑被称为迷你大脑
The cerebellum is called the mini brain
因为它在你的大脑后面
because it's in the back of your brain.
它看起来像一个小迷你版
It looks like a little mini version
是大脑的其余部分
of the rest of your brain.
这是一个绝对令人难以置信的结构
It's an absolutely incredible structure
这与运动有关
that's involved in movement.
它还有很多非运动相关的功能
It also has a lot of non-movement associated functions.
简而言之  小脑从你的感官获得输入
In brief, the cerebellum gets input from your senses,
特别是你的眼睛和注意力
particularly, your eyes and pays attention
你的眼睛在空间中的位置  你在看什么
to where your eyes are in space, what you're looking at.
它基本上需要三个方面的信息
It basically takes information about three aspects
你的眼睛和正在发生的眼球运动
of your eyes and eye movements which are occurring
当你的头像这样  这叫做pitch
when your head goes like this, which is called pitch.
像这样
So this is pitch.
对于那些在听的人  我只是上下点头
For those of you that are listening I'm just nodding
然后有偏移
up and down then there's yaw,
这就像摇头   从一边到另一边
which is like shaking your head, no, from side to side.
然后是滚动  就像有时
And then there's roll, which is that like sometimes
如果你看到灵长类动物  比如狨猴之类的
if you see a primate, like a Marmoset or something,
当他们看着你时  他们会摇头
they will roll their head when they look at you.
实际上  他们这样做的原因是它有助于产生
Actually, the reason they do that is it helps generate
深度感知  它是一种运动视差形式
depth perception, it's a kind of form of motion parallax
如果你很好奇他们为什么这样做
if you're curious why they do that.
不是为了看起来可爱  他们这样做是因为当他们这样做时
It's not to look cute, they do it because when they do that,
即使你静止而他们静止
even if you're stationary and they're stationary,
他们获得了更好的深度感知
they get better depth perception
至于你离他们有多远
as to how far away from them you are.
所以你有俯仰、偏移和滚转
So you've got pitch, yaw and roll.
当你移动你的头和你的身体时
And as you move your head and as you move your body
你在空间中移动  你视网膜上的图像移动
and you move through space, the image on your retina moves,
俯仰、滚动偏移以某种组合
pitch, yaw on roll in some combination,
这些信息被传递到你的小脑
that information is relayed to your cerebellum.
所以它的视觉信息很丰富
So it's rich with visual information.
还有一张你的体表地图
There's also a map of your body surface
以及你在小脑中的动作和时间
and your movements and timing in the cerebellum.
所以这是一个令人难以置信的结构  汇集了
So it's an incredible structure that brings together
运动的时间  四肢正在运动
timing of movements, which limbs are moving
并有本体信息
and has proprioceptive information.
它真的是一个迷你大脑
It really is a mini brain,
它只是那里最酷的小结构
it's just the coolest little structure back there.
而在人类中  其实并没有那么少
And in humans, it's actually not that little,
这只是一个令人难以置信的结构
it's just an incredible structure.
那么  所有这些信息都集成在那里
Now, all this information is integrated there,
但大多数人没有告诉我们的是  很多学习
but what most people don't tell us is that a lot of learning
涉及时间的技能学习的运动连环动作
of motor sequences of skill learning that involves timing
发生在小脑
occurs in the cerebellum.
那么  你不能真正使用这些信息
Now, you can't really use that information
除了知道在你学得很好之后
except to know that after you learn something pretty well,
它由你的小脑传递或处理
it's handed off or kind of handled by your cerebellum,
但是你可以用你的小脑做一些事情
but there is something that you can do with your cerebellum
以增加运动范围和灵活性
to increase range of motion and flexibility.
很多我们的灵活性  信不信由你
Much of our flexibility, believe it or not
不是因为我们的肌腱特别长
is not because our tendons are particular length
或弹性  虽然它起到了一些作用
or a elasticity, although that plays some role,
这不是因为我们的肌肉短
it's not because our muscles are short.
我甚至不知道那意味着什么
I don't know what that would even mean.
有些人有更长的肌肉
Some people have longer muscle bellies
或较短的肌肉  但你的肌肉总是
or shorter muscle bellies, but your muscles always
基本上跨越骨骼的整个长度
essentially span the entire length of the bone
或肢体或靠近它  以及你的肌腱
or limb or close to it, along with your tendons.
但与肌肉的神经支配有关
But has to do with the neural innervation of muscle
事实上  当肌肉被拉长时
and the fact that when muscles are elongated,
会有一个点  它们不会再伸展更多了
there's a point at which they won't stretch out
这时候神经就会燃烧起来  它们就会关闭
any longer and the nerves fire, and they shut down
你实际上有抑制途径
that you actually have inhibitory pathways
阻止你收缩肌肉
that prevent you from contracting the muscles
或者从延伸它们  不再延伸它们
or from extending them, from stretching them out any more.
所以你现在就可以做到这一点
So you can do this right now.
如果你在开车  不要这样做  因为除非你有
If you're driving, don't do it because unless you have
一辆自动驾驶汽车  你需要自己动手
a self-driving car, you'll need to take your hands
关闭转向
off the steering.
但是因为视觉和肌肉的方式
But because of the way that vision and your muscles
在你的小脑中有代表
are represented in your cerebellum,
事实证明  你的视觉运动范围
it turns out that your range of visual motion
和你的视野范围  从字面上看  视野有多宽
and your range of vision, literally how wide a field of view
你可以将四肢伸展多远
you take impacts how far you can extend your limbs.
所以我们稍后会讨论这个
So we'll talk about this in a second
究竟如何做到这一点并探索这一点
exactly how to do this and explore this.
但是当你穿过空间  当你向前走
But as you move through space, as you walk forward
或者你向后走  或者你歪着头
or you walk backward, or you tilt your head
或者你学习了一项技能  或者你只是按照正常的方式操作
or you learn a skill, or you just operate in the normal ways
一整天  开车、骑自行车等等
throughout your day, driving, biking, et cetera,
你的眼睛正在产生自发的运动
your eyes are generating spontaneous movements
以抵消视觉滑动
to offset visual slip.
换句话说  你看世界并不模糊
In other words, you don't see the world as blurry
即使你在移动因为你的眼睛
even though you're moving because your eyes
正在产生低代偿性眼球运动
are generating low compensatory eye movements
抵消你的运动
to offset your motion.
所以如果我旋转  我们可以做这个实验
So if I spin, we could do this experiment.
我们对医学生做了一个有趣的实验
There's a fun experiment we do with medical students
在那里你闭着眼睛在椅子上旋转它们
where you spin them around in a chair with their eyes closed
然后你停下来让他们睁开眼睛
and then you stop and you have them open their eyes
他们的眼睛是这样的  是眼球震颤
and their eyes are going like this, is nystagmus.
我不建议你做这个实验
I don't suggest you do this experiment.
当我们还是孩子的时候  我们做了一个不同的实验
When we were kids, we did a different experiment
这是拿一根棍子看顶部
which was to take a stick and to look at the top
并在草坪上旋转
of the stick and to spin around on the lawn
看着棍子的顶部然后把它放下
looking at the top of the stick then put it down
并尝试跳过它
on the ground and try and jump over it.
而你最终就像跳到一边
And you ended up like jumping to the side,
你完全想念这件事
you miss the thing entirely.
我希望你不要做那两个“实验”的原因
The reason those two "experiments" which I hope you don't do
或让别人做
or for somebody else to do.
它们起作用的原因是因为通常你的眼球运动
The reason they work is because normally your eye movements
你的平衡和你的四肢运动是协调的
and your balance and your limb movements are coordinated.
但是当你转过身来仰望棍子时
But when you spin around looking up at the stick,
你在做的是盯着你的眼睛
what you're doing is you're fixating your eyes
在你移动时在一个位置
on one location while you're moving.
然后当你停止这两种机制时
And then when you stop those two mechanisms
完全解耦  就像被扔进入外太空了一样
are completely uncoupled and it's like being thrown into outer space.
我从未去过外太空
I've never been to outer space,
但可能是这样的  低重力  零重力
but probably something like that, low gravity, zero gravity.
如果你闭着眼睛在椅子上转来转去
If you spin around in your chair with your eyes closed,
你没有给出你正在旋转的视觉输入
you're not giving the visual input that you're spinning.
然后你睁开眼睛 然后眼睛只有
And then you open the eyes and then the eyes only have
我们所说的前庭  你的眼睛在颤抖
what we call the vestibular, your eyes jolting
来回  来回
back and forth, back and forth.
同样  这些不是你需要做的实验
Again, these aren't experiments you need to do
因为我刚刚告诉了你结果
'cause I just told you the result.
然而  如果你想扩大你的运动范围
However, if you want to extend your range of motion,
你可以这样做...
you can do that by...
这些东西总是看起来很傻  但在这一点上
These things always look goofy, but at this point
我只是有点习惯做这些事情
I'm just kind of used to doing these things.
如果我想扩大我的活动范围
If I want to extend my range of movement,
首先  我想测量我的运动范围
first, I want to measure my range of motion.
如果你在听我在做什么  我在伸展
If you're listening what I'm doing is I'm stretching out
我的手臂像两边的 T
my arms like a T on either side
我试图尽可能地把他们推到后面
and I'm trying to push them as far back as I can,
这对我来说感觉就像我的肩膀一样
which for me feels like it's in line with my shoulders
我不能走得更远
and I can't get much further.
我不是真的超级灵活
I'm not really super flexible
我也不是特别不灵活  至少在身体上
nor am I particularly inflexible at least physically.
所以我要做的就是停下来
So what I would then do is stop.
我会把眼睛移到远处的边缘
I would move my eyes to the far periphery.
所以我的眼睛一直向左移动
So I'm moving my eyes all the way to the left
同时保持我的头部和身体静止
while keeping my head and body stationary.
我试着尽可能地越过我的左肩看
I'm trying to look over my left shoulder as far as I can
然后向右走
then off to the right.
这样做有点尴尬  然后向上然后向下
It's a little awkward to do this, then up then down
但我主要会专注于左边
but I'm mostly going to just focus on left
然后对了
and then right.
现在它正在做的是发送信号
Now what that's doing is it's sending a signal
我的小脑  我的视野在那里
to my cerebellum that my field of view is way over to there
然后去那里
and way over to there.
记住你的视觉注意力有一个光圈
Remember your visual attention has an aperture.
它可以很窄  也可以很宽
It can be narrow, or it can be broad.
我已经谈到了一些好处
And I've talked about some of the benefits
采取广阔的视野
of taking a broad visual aperture
以放松神经系统
in order to relax the nervous system.
这只是移动我的眼睛  而不是我的头
This is just moving my eyes, not my head,
就像我刚才那样  从一边到另一边
like I just did for a second, from side to side.
现在我可以重新测试了
Now I can retest.
实际上你会增加大约 5 到 15 度
And actually you get about a five to 15 degree increase
在你的运动范围内
in your range of motion.
现在我正在为你做这件事
Now I'm doing this for you.
你可以说  “好吧  他玩这个游戏是因为他知道
You can say, "Well, he gamed it 'cause he knew
“他希望的结果”
"the result that he was hoping for."
但是你可以试试这个
But you can try this.
你也可以为腿做这个
And you can do this for legs too.
你基本上可以对任何肢体执行此操作
You can do this for any limb essentially.
这就是纯粹的小脑
And that's it's purely cerebellar.
这是因为本体视觉
And it's because the proprioceptive visual
和肢体运动反馈收敛
and limb movement feedback converge
以我们控制肌梭的方式
in the ways that we control our muscle spindles
以及我们控制肌肉纤维和肌腱的方式
and the way we control the muscle fibers and the tendons
基本上你可以获得更大的运动范围
and essentially you can get bigger range of motion.
所以实际上我们会在运动前热身
So actually we'll warm up before exercise
或在通过为我的身体做运动来学习技能之前
or before skill learning by both doing movements for my body
但也让我的眼睛左右移动
but also moving my eyes from side to side
为了产生更大的运动范围
in order to generate larger range of motion
如果运动范围是我感兴趣的东西
if range of motion is something that I'm interested in.
所以这是一个有趣的实践  你可以玩一下
So that's a fun one that you can play with a little bit
它纯粹是有关小脑的东西
and it's purely cerebellar.
之后我们可能会回到小脑功能
Some other time we'll get back into a cerebellar function.
有各种各样令人难以置信的东西
There's all sorts of just incredible stuff
你可以用小脑做的
that you can do with cerebellum.
我在较早的一集中谈到了神经可塑性
I talked in an earlier episode on neuro-plasticity
关于如何打乱你的前庭
about how you can disrupt your vestibular world.
换句话说  通过进入加速模式
In other words, by getting into modes of acceleration,
以某种方式在倾斜的空间中移动
moving through space where you're tilted in certain ways,
它可以打开可塑性的窗户
it can open up the windows for plasticity
还有其他方式
and yet other ways.
所以你可以看看  这是早期的播客之一
So you can check that out, it's one of the earlier episodes
关于神经可塑性的  都有时间戳
on neuroplasticity everything's timestamped.
但与此同时  如果你想扩大你的运动范围
But meanwhile, if you want to expand your range of motion
在学习技能之前或之后  这是一个有趣的
before doing skill learning or afterward, this is a fun one.
这也挺巧妙的  因为我有这种
It's also kind of neat because I have this kind of aversion
厌恶拉伸的感觉
to stretching work.
拉伸从来都不是我想做的事
It never seems like something I want to do
所以我总是不去做拉伸
and so I always put it off.
所以如果我从扩展的视觉实践开始
So if I start with the visual practice of expanding
我的视野偏向一侧或另一侧
my field of view to off to one side or the other side
或向上或向下  然后我发现我很自然的
or up or down, then what I find is I'm naturally
变得更灵活了
more flexible.
我天生就不是很灵活
I'm not naturally more flexible.
结果是  我通过这个可以扩大我的运动范围
What's happened is I've expanded my range of motion.
让我们来谈谈可视化和心理彩排
Let's talk about visualization and mental rehearsal.
我被问过很多这个问题
I've been asked about this a lot,
我认为这与那种好莱坞的想法有关
and I think it relates back to that kind of matrix
也就是我们可以嵌入一种技能
Hollywood idea that we can just be embedded with a skill.
虽然在这种情况下  公平地说
Although in this case, in fairness,
可视化涉及到一些这种功能
visualization involves some work.
我在之前的一集中谈过这个
And I've talked about this on an earlier episode
有些人觉得很难
that some people find it very hard
在心理上形象化事物
to mentally visualize things.
有些人觉得这很容易
And some people find it very easy.
1960 年代的科学家做了很多伟大的工作
There was great work that was done in the 1960s
斯坦福大学的 Roger Shepherd 和其他人
by Roger Shepherd at Stanford and by others,
观察人的一种能力
looking at people's ability to rotate
他们脑子里旋转三维物体
three-dimensional objects in their mind.
有些人真的很擅长这个
And some people really good at this
有些人不太擅长这一点
and some people are less good at this.
一个人可以通过重复它来做得更好
And one can get better at it by repeating it.
但是我们今天要解决的问题
But the question we're going to deal with today
它有帮助吗  它能让你学得更快吗？
is does it help, does it let you learn things faster?
事实上  答案似乎是肯定的  它可以
And indeed the answer appears to be yes, it can.
然而  不管你听到了什么  它都没有那么好
However, despite what you've heard, it is not as good.
这不是完全替代
It is not a total replacement
对于实际练习本身
for physical performance itself.
所以我将对此非常具体
So I'm going to be really concrete about this.
我一直听到  只是想象收缩肌肉
I hear all the time that just imagining
可以带来
contracting a muscle can lead to the same gains
和实际上收缩那块肌肉  相同的收益
as actually contracting that muscle.
只是想象一项技能可以导致同样的
Just imagining a skill can lead to the same increases
增长其实际执行该技能的表现
in performance as actually executing that skill.
而事实并非如此
And that's simply not the case.
但是  它可以补充或支持体育锻炼
However, it can supplement or support physical training
以及以非常强大的方式促进学习技能
and skill learning in ways that are quite powerful.
关于这个的更有趣的研究之一
One of the more interesting studies on this
来自Rang Ganason等人
was from Rang Ganason at all,
请原谅我的发音
forgive me for the pronunciation.
这是一篇稍旧的论文  2004 年
This was a slightly older paper, 2004,
但仍然是我认为的
but nonetheless was one that I thought
取得了特别令人印象深刻的结果
had particularly impressive results
并包括所有适当的控制变量等
and included all the appropriate controls, et cetera.
他们所做的是研究了 30 个对象
And what they did is they looked at 30 subjects.
他们将他们分成不同的组
They divide them into different groups.
他们让一组去实现  基本上是手指弯曲
They had one group perform essentially finger flection.
所以它实际上有点像如果你只是在听
So it actually sort of the imagine if you're just listening
就是这个“来吧” 的手指动作
to this, the come here a finger movement.
他们也有肘部弯曲  所以二头肌卷曲式运动
They also had elbow flection, so bicep curl type movement.
他们要么让受试者进行实际的身体运动
And they either had subjects do a actual physical movement
对抗阻力  或者想象移动他们的手指
against resistance, or to imagine moving their finger
或者他们的手腕朝向肩膀
or their wrist towards the shoulder,
肘部弯曲的意思
meaning at the bending at the elbow
再加上实际阻力
towards actual resistance.
长话短说
Just to make a long story short,
他们发现
what they found was that there were increases
在这个手指上  内收力量  外展力量 有增长
in this finger, adduction strength, abduction,
对不起  大约增长了35%的力量和肘部弯曲
excuse me, strength of about 35% and the elbow flection
这种力气增加了约 13.5%  这是相当可观的
strength by about 13.5%, which are pretty impressive
考虑到这只是精神上的
considering that was just done mentally.
所以他们让人们想象在负重的情况下移动
So they had people imagine moving against a weight,
一个非常重量级的人或曾想象人们移动他们的手腕
a very heavyweight or had imagined people moving their wrist
朝着他们的肩膀对抗一个非常重量级的人
towards their shoulder against a very heavyweight.
但同样  他们没有这样做
But again, they weren't doing it,
他们只是想象而已
they were just imagining it.
其他实验着眼于大脑
Other experiments looked at the brain
以及这段时间大脑中发生了什么
and what was happening in the brain during this time.
所以我们稍后会讨论这个
So we'll talk about that in a moment.
但基本上他们发现的是
But essentially what they found were improvements
力气增强了从 13.5% 到 35% 不等
in strength of anywhere from 13.5 to 35%.
然而  实际的体能训练组
However, the actual physical training group,
实际移动手腕的组
the groups that actually moved their wrist
或根据实际体重移动手指
or moved their finger against an actual physical weight
有大约 53% 的改进
had improvements of about 53%.
所以这在整个业界中一遍又一遍地被引用
So this repeats over and over throughout the literature
心理排练可以增加力量
mental rehearsal can cause increases in strength.
它可以增加技能的获取和学习
It can create increases in skill acquisition and learning,
但如果单独完成  它们永远不会那么棒
but they are never as great if done alone
与实际的物理执行相比
as compared to the actual physical execution
这些运动或身体运动
of those movements or the physical movement
但这其实不应该那么令人惊讶
of those weights, which shouldn't come as so surprising.
然而  如果我们退后一步  我们说
However, if we step back and we say,
“嗯  这种提升的源头是什么？”
"Well, what is the source of this improvement?"
你可能不在乎来源是什么
You might not care what the source is
因为我可以告诉你这是一个大脑区域
because I could tell you it's one brain area
或其他大脑区域
or another brain area.
它会有什么不同？
What difference would it make?
但同样  如果你能稍微了解一下机制
But again, if you can understand mechanism a little bit,
你有能力创造新的
you're in a position to create newer
甚至更好的工具方法
and even better protocols.
心理排练似乎要做的是参与
What mental rehearsal appears to do is engage the activity
我们谈到的那些上运动神经元的活动
of those upper motor neurons that we talked about
回到播客开头
way back at the beginning of the episode.
记住你有上运动神经元
Remember you have upper motor neurons
控制刻意的行动
that control deliberate action,
你有实际上的下运动神经元
you've got lower motor neurons that actually
连接到肌肉并移动这些肌肉
connect to the muscles and move those muscles
你有中央模式生成器
and you have central pattern generators.
心理排练  典型地闭上眼睛
Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically
并考虑特定的运动顺序
and thinking about a particular sequence of movement
并在一个人的“心灵之眼”中想象它
and visualizing it in one's "mind's eye"
激活上运动神经元
creates activation of the upper motor neurons
这与实际运动非常相似  如果不一样的话
that's very similar if not the same as the actual movement.
这是有道理的  因为上运动神经元
And that makes sense because the upper motor neurons
都是关于运动的命令
are all about the command for movement.
他们不是实际执行运动的人
They are not the ones that actually execute the movement.
记住  上运动神经元是那些
Remember, upper motor neurons are the ones
生成运动命令
that generate the command for movement,
不是实际的运动
not the actual movement.
产生实际运动的那些
The ones that generate the actual movement
是下运动神经元
are the lower motor neurons
和中央模式发生器
and the central pattern generators.
所以可视化是一个强大的工具
So visualization is a powerful tool.
如何使用可视化？
How can you use visualization?
好吧  在这项研究中  他们让人们执行此操作
Well, in this study, they had people perform this
一周五天
five days a week.
我相信它是15
I believe that it was 15.
是的  每周 5 天  每天 15 分钟
Yes, it was 15 minutes per day, five days a week
12 周
for 12 weeks.
所以这是很多心理排练
So that's a lot of mental rehearsal.
每天的时间不是很多  每天15分钟
It's not a ton of time each day, 15 minutes per day.
但是坐下来闭上眼睛
But sitting down, closing your eyes
并想象经历特定的技能练习
and imagining going through a particular skill practice
或移动重物
or moving a weight.
也许这是在钢琴上弹奏琴键  如果那是你想完成的事情
Maybe it's playing keys on a piano if that's your thing
或弹吉他  每天 15 分钟
or strings on a guitar, for 15 minutes a day,
每周 5 天持续 12 周是相当可观的
five days per week for 12 weeks is considerable.
我认为大多数人  鉴于事实
I think most people, given the fact
那实际的练习  身体的练习
that the actual practice, the physical practice
将导致更大的改进
is going to lead to larger improvements,
更大的改进  然后是心理训练
greater improvements then would the mental training
会促进实际的体能训练
would opt for the actual physical training.
当然  如果你在飞机上
But of course, if you're on a plane
并且你无法使用你的吉他
and you don't have access to your guitar
你也肯定不会
and you're certainly not going to be sprinting
在过道上跑来跑去
up and down the aisle or you are very serious
或者关于你的手艺  你很认真地想提高性能
about your craft and you want to accelerate performance
提高你的手艺或增加力量
of your craft or strength increases
或类似的东西  然后增加或添加
or something of that sort, then augmenting or adding in
可视化培训很可能会
the visualization training very likely will compound
与实际体能训练的效果结合在一起
the effects of the actual physical training.
没有很多研究着眼于如何可视化
There are not a lot of studies looking at how visualization
在纯粹的体能训练之上
on top of pure physical training
可以提高学习率
can increase the rates of learning
和巩固学习等
and consolidation of learning, et cetera.
这实际上是一项艰巨的研究  因为难以控制
It's actually a hard study to do because hard to control for
因为你会在它的位置做什么
because what would you do in its place.
你可能会添加实际的体能训练
You would probably add actual physical training
然后这总是会导致更大的影响
and then that's always going to lead to greater effects.
所以重点是如果你想使用可视化训练
So the point is if you want to use visualization training,
很棒  但不要觉得
great, but forget the idea that visualization training
可视化训练会与实际训练的效果一样好
is as good as the actual behavior.
你总是听到这个
You hear this all the time.
人们说  你知道吗  如果你想象一个经历
People say, do you know that if you imagine an experience
给你的大脑和你的身体
to your brain and to your body,
和实际体验完全一样
it's exactly the same as the actual experience.
绝对不是的
Absolutely not.
这不是神经系统的工作方式
This is not the way the nervous system works.
对不起  我不是要打破任何人的幻想
I'm sorry, I don't mean to burst anybody's bubble,
但你的幻想是由不切实际组成的
but your bubble is made of myths.
事实是大脑
And the fact of the matter is that the brain,
当它执行一个动作时
when it executes a movement is generating
它正在生成本体反馈
proprioceptive feedback.
并且关键地涉及本体感受反馈
And that proprioceptive feedback is critically involved
在产生我们的体验感
in generating our sense of the experience
以及学习之类的东西
and in things like learning.
所以我不说这个因为我不喜欢这个主意
So I don't say this because I don't like the idea
那个可视化行不通
that visualization couldn't work.
事实上  可视化确实有效
In fact visualization does work,
但它不会起那么大的作用
but it doesn't work as well,
它不会创造同样的效果
it doesn't create the same millu,
与实际练习同样的化学物质  同样的环境
the same chemical millu, the same environment
不能像实际的  身体上参与行为
as actual, physically engaging in the behavior,
技能、阻力训练等一样
the skill the resistance training, et cetera.
我愿意打赌下面说的这些也是真的
And I'd be willing to wager that the same is true
各种体验
for experiences of all kinds.
创伤后应激障碍是这种令人难以置信的不幸情况
PTSD is this incredibly unfortunate circumstance
其中经常重播创伤性事件
in which there's a replay often of the traumatic event
那感觉很真实
that feels very real.
但这并不是说重播本身
But that's not to say that the replay itself
与实际事件相同
is the same as the actual event.
当然  需要处理 PTSD
And of course, PTSD needs to be dealt with
更严重的情况  需要看医生
with the utmost level of seriousness, it should be treated.
事实上  我的实验室正在研究这类事情
In fact, my lab works on these sorts of things,
但我的观点是关于可视化和想象的东西
but my point about visualization and imagining something
与实际体验不一样
not being the same as the actual experience
是基于这种本体感觉的概念
is grounded in this idea of proprioception.
以及反馈到小脑的事实
And the fact that feedback to the cerebellum,
小脑  与大脑的其他区域交谈
the cerebellum, talking to other areas of the brain
积极参与沟通
are critically involved in communicating
到我们神经系统的其余部分
to the rest of our nervous system.
这不仅仅是因为我们想象某些事情正在发生
That not just that we believe something is happening
但实际上正在发生一些事情
but something is actually happening.
在肌肉负荷的情况下
And in the case of muscle loads,
肌肉实际上感到紧张
muscles actually feeling tension,
肌肉紧张的实际感觉
the actual feeling of tension in the muscle.
在这种张力下肌肉的收缩
The contracting of the muscle under that tension
是重要适应过程的一部分
is part of the important adaptation process.
在未来的一集中  我们将讨论肌肉肥大
In a future episode, we'll talk about hypertrophy
以及它是如何在上运动神经元水平上发挥作用的
and how that works at the level of upper motor neurons,
下运动神经元和肌肉本身
lower motor neurons and muscle itself.
但现在只知道可视化可以工作
But for now just know that visualization can work.
效果不如真正的体能训练和实践
It doesn't work as well as real physical training
但这些效果 35%
and practice, but these effects of 35%
或 13.5% 的增长相当可观
or 13.5% increases are pretty considerable.
他们只是没有 53% 的增长那么好
They're just not as great as the 53% increases
来自实际的体能训练
that come from actual physical training.
对于那些有兴趣
For those of you that are interested
在一些关于音乐训练的技能学习中
in some of this skill learning that more relates
还有与节奏和节拍器有关的
to musical training, but also how cadence and metronomes
和音调等可以支持物理学习
and tones, et cetera, can support physical learning.
如果你对此感兴趣
If you're interested in that, if are you a
有一篇精彩的评论
there is a wonderful review, also published
又上神经元期刊了  优秀的期刊
in the Journal Neuron again, excellent journal
由 Herholz 和 Zatorre 撰写  那是 HERHOLZ
by Herholz and Zatorre, that's H-E-R-H-O-L-Z
和萨托雷
and Zatorre, Z-A-T-O-R-R-E.
那真的详细描述了音乐训练是如何
That really describes in detail how musical training
可以影响各种不同的事情
can impact all sorts of different things
以及如何进行节奏训练  无论是否带有音调
and how cadence training, whether or not with tones
或听觉反馈之类的东西
or auditory feedback and things of that sort
延续到不仅仅是器乐训练
carries over to not just instrumental music training
还有各种体育技能的学习
but also physical skill learning of various kinds.
所以如果你想更深入地了解
So if you want to do the deep dive,
那将是你可以在网上轻松找到它的地方
that would be the place you can find it easily online.
它可以作为完整的文章使用
It's available as a complete article
免费
free of charge, et cetera.
你们中的许多人可能会问我能吃什么
Many of you are probably asking what can I take
来加速技能学习？
in order to accelerate skill learning?
嗯  条件会有所不同
Well, the conditions are going to vary,
但动机是关键
but motivation is key.
你必须去训练
You have to show up to the training session
有足够的动力来集中你的注意力
motivated enough to focus your attention
并进行大量重复
and to perform a lot of repetitions
在训练连环动作中
in the training sequence.
这只是一个先决条件
That's just a prerequisite.
没有药丸可以让你
There's no pill that's going to allow you to do
用更少的重复来获得更多的学习能力
fewer repetitions and extract more learning out of fewer repetitions.
实际上更多的是
It's actually more a question of what are the conditions
你可以为自己创造什么样的条件  这样你就可以
that you can create for yourself such that you can generate
在单位时间内重复次数更多
more repetitions per unit time.
我认为这是正确的思考方式
I think that's the right way to think about it.
你可以创造什么条件
What are the conditions that you can create
为你自己在你的头脑和你的身体
for yourself in your mind and in your body
让你集中注意力
that are going to allow you to focus?
我已经谈到了专注  可塑性  动机
And I've talked about focus and plasticity
在前几集中
and motivation in previous episodes.
如果你对此有疑问  请查看这些播客
Please see those episodes if you have questions about that.
我已经详细介绍了基础科学中的许多工具
I've detailed a lot of tools in the underlying science.
所以对某些人来说  可能是喝一杯咖啡
So for some people, it might be drinking a cup of coffee
并在训练前补充水分
and getting hydrated before the training session.
对你们中的一些人来说  可能是避免喝咖啡
For some of you, it might be avoiding coffee
因为它让你太紧张
because it makes you too jittery
你的注意力非常分散
and your attention jumps all over the place.
它会发生巨大的变化
It's going to vary tremendously.
没有什么神奇的药丸可以让你
There is no magic pill that's going to allow you
少花钱多办事  这不会发生
to get more out of less, that's just not going to happen.
这根本不会发生
It's simply not going to happen.
你不会得到更多的学习
You're not going to get more learning
更少的重复或更少的时间
out of fewer repetitions or less time.
然而  有一些化合物
However, there are a few compounds
我认为值得一提的是因为他们的能力
I think are worth mentioning because of their ability
以提高实际的身体表现
to improve the actual physical performance,
某些类型运动的实际执行
the actual execution of certain types of movements.
其中一些也已经展示
And some of these have also been shown
改善认知功能
to improve cognitive function,
尤其是在老年人口中
especially in older population.
因此  如果我至少不提及它们  那我就是失职了
So I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention them.
事实上  我今天只会提到一个
I'm only going to mention one today in fact.
特别有趣的那个
The one that's particularly interesting
并且确实有很多数据是alpha GPC
and for which there really are a lot of data is alpha GPC
我要尝试发音
and I'm going to attempt to pronounce
什么是 alpha GPC
what alpha GPC actually is.
它是α甘油磷酸胆碱
It's alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine.
α GPC  α 甘油磷酸胆碱
Alpha GPC, alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine.
看  如果我一遍又一遍地重复
See, if I keep doing it over and over repetitions,
α 甘油磷酸胆碱
alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine.
在那里我犯了一个错误
There I made an error.
好的  重点是 alpha GPC
Okay, so the point is that alpha GPC,
至少在美国
which is at least in the United States
在柜台出售通常按剂量服用
is sold over the counter typically is taken in dosages
约 300 至 600 毫克
of about 300 to 600 milligrams.
这是单次剂量或已被证明可以
That's a single dose or have been shown to do
一些对你们中的一些人可能有益的事情
a number of things that for some of you might be beneficial.
一是提升动力输出
One is to enhance power output.
所以如果你在做类似投掷的事情
So if you're engaging in something like Shotput throwing
或抗阻训练或短跑
or resistance training or sprinting
或者你必须产生大量能量的东西
or something where you have to generate a lot of power,
也许你在攀岩
maybe you're doing rock climbing, but you're working
你努力在攀岩的特定方面进行提升
on a particular aspect of your rock climbing
这涉及产生很大的力量  很大的力量
that involves generating a lot of force, a lot of power.
那么理论上  alpha GPC 可能对你有益
Well then in theory, alpha GPC could be beneficial to you.
对于认知效应  剂量要高得多
For the cognitive effects, the dosages are much higher
每天最多 1200 毫克  分为三个剂量
up to 1200 milligrams daily divided into three doses
400 毫克是
of 400 milligrams is what the studies
我能够找到的研究显示的 或建议使用的
that I was able to find show or used.
对认知能力下降的影响被描述为显着
The effects on cognitive decline are described as notable.
值得注意  这意味着多项研究表明
Notable, meaning several studies showed a significant
但对抵消认知能力下降的影响不大
but modest effect on in offsetting cognitive decline,
特别是在老年人口中
in particular in older populations
和一些人群  还有一些报道说
and some populations, even with some reported
神经变性
neuro degeneration.
力量输出显着
Power output was notable.
多显着呢？  显着是什么意思？
How notable, what does that mean, notable?
一项研究指出  力量输出增加了 14%
A study noted a 14% increase in power output.
这是相当可观的  14%
That's pretty substantial, 14%.
如果你仔细想想  但这不像是翻倍
And if you think about it, but it wasn't like a doubling
或类似的东西
or something of that sort.
信不信由你  阿尔茨海默氏症的症状已被证明
Believe it or not, the symptoms of Alzheimer's
至少在营养保健品中
have been shown at least among the nutraceuticals
其中alpha GPC是显着  在患有阿尔茨海默氏症的人中
of which alpha GPC is to significantly improve cognition
能提高认知
in people with Alzheimer's.
现在这一集  不是关于认知能力下降
Now this episode, isn't about cognitive decline
和长寿  我们之后将谈论那个
and longevity, we will talk about that,
但这就是所谓的alpha GPC的另一种效应
but this is a so-called another effect of alpha GPC.
α GPC 增加脂肪氧化
Fat oxidation is increased by alpha GPC,
alpha GPC 促进生长激素释放
growth hormone release is promoted by alpha GPC
虽然在很小的程度上
although to a small degree.
正如你所看到的  特别是像 alpha GPC 这样的东西
So as you can see, things like alpha GPC in particular
当它们与低水平的咖啡因结合时
when they are combined with low levels of caffeine
可以有这些提高力量输出的效果
can have these effects of improving power output,
可以改善生长激素的释放
can improve growth hormone release,
可以改善脂肪氧化
can improve fat oxidation.
所有这些东西理论​​上都可以支持技能学习
All these things in theory can support skill learning.
但他们真正在做的是他们正在调整
But what they're really doing is they're adjusting
你将要执行很多重复动作的基础
the foundation upon which you are going to execute
这么多动作  很多重复
these many, many repetitions.
咖啡因本身也是如此
The same thing would be said for caffeine itself.
如果那是激励你的东西
If that's something that motivates you
让你从椅子上站起来真正做
and gets you out of a chair to actually do
体能训练  那就是
the physical training, then that's something
也许可以改善或增强
that can perhaps improve or enhance
技能学习率
the rate of skill learning
以及你保留这些技能的程度
and how well you retain those skills.
那么  在上一集我谈到
Now on a previous episode I talked about,
也就是讲肾上腺素的影响的那期
and this was the episode on epinephrin on adrenaline.
我谈到了如何进行心理、认知学习
I talked about how for mental, for cognitive learning,
增加肾上腺素是有道理的
it makes sense to spike epinephrin,
在认知学习之后
to bump epinephrin levels up adrenaline levels up
提高肾上腺素水平
after cognitive learning.
对于物理学习  似乎正好相反
For physical learning, it appears to be the opposite
如果你平时会用咖啡因
that if caffeine is in your practice
或者如果你决定尝试 alpha GPC
or if you decide to try alpha GPC
你想在训练前做那件事
that you would want to do that before the training,
训练前服用
take it before the training use it.
它的作用应该延伸到训练中
Its effect should extend into the training,
大概自始至终  然后
presumably throughout, and then afterward
如果你正在考虑遵循某些工具方法
if you're thinking about following some of the protocols
我们今天讨论的  你可以使用一些空闲时间
that we discussed today, that you would use
让大脑进行重播
some sort of idle time where the brain can replay
重播这些运动动作
these motor sequences in reverse.
然后当然  你还可以
And then of course, you want to do things
优化你的睡眠
that optimize your sleep.
我得到的很多问题都是关于
A lot of the questions I get are about how different
我描述的工具方法和事情
protocols and things that I described
开始相互碰撞
start to collide with one another.
比如说  你在 10:30 睡觉
So let's say for instance, you go to bed at 10:30
你可能要在 9:30 进行技能训练
and you're going to do your skill training at 9:30,
那么  摄入大量咖啡因可能就不是一个好主意
well, taking a lot of caffeine then is not going to be
因为它会影响你的睡眠
a good idea 'cause it's going to compromise your sleep.
所以我不是来为你设计完美的时间表
So I'm not here to design the perfect schedule for you
因为每个人的情况不一样
because everyone's situation's vary.
所以要优化的是重复、失败、
So the things to optimize are repetitions, failures,
更多的重复  更多的失败训练
more repetitions, more failures at the offset of training.
有一些空闲时间  可以直接入睡
Having some idle time that can be straight into sleep
或者可能只是让大脑闲置也可以
or it could be simply letting the brain just go idle
五到十分钟  意味着不要专注于任何事情
for five to 10 minutes, mean not focusing on anything,
不刷手机  社交媒体  不发送电子邮件
not scrolling, social media, not emailing,
理想情况下甚至不和别人说话  就是躺着
not ideally not even talking to somebody just lying down
或闭目静坐
or sitting quietly with your eyes closed
让这些运动连环动作重播
letting those motor sequences replay.
然后我们谈了如何才能
Then we talked about how one can come back
从额外的训练阶段中进行恢复
for additional training sessions,
使用节拍器之类的东西
use things like metronoming where you're queuing
对你有一些外部暗示、一些刺激的关注
your attention to some external cue, some stimulus,
在这种情况下  听觉刺激最有可能
in this case, an auditory stimulus most likely
并试图在单位时间内产生更多的重复
and trying to generate more repetitions per unit time.
再说一遍  重复和错误是关键
So again, it's repetitions and errors, that's key.
然后我们还谈到了一些事情
And then we also talked about some things
你可以做的  涉及小脑神经生理学
that you can do involving cerebellar neurophysiology
扩大运动范围  如果那是你的限制
to extend range of motion if that's what's limiting for you
或使用可视化来增强练习
or to use visualization to augment the practice
或者要是你的技能比较特殊  涉及好天气
or let's say your particular skill involves nice weather
如果外面正在下雨或下雪或雷雨
and it's raining or snowing outside
你不能到外面
and you can't get outside or thunderstorm,
那么这时候  可视化训练
then that's where visualization training
在这些条件下可能是一个很好的替代品
might be a good replacement under those conditions.
或者在大多数情况下会是那种
Or in most cases is going to be the kind of thing
除了实际的身体技能之外
that you're going to want to do
你可以去做的事
in addition to the actual physical skill
在力量训练课程完成之后做
or strength training session done,
至少在我们描述的研究中
at least in the study that we described
每周 5 天  每天 15 分钟
for 15 minutes a day, five days a week
在 10 到 12 周左右的时间内
over a period of 10 to 12 weeks or so.
所以希望这能说明问题
So hopefully that makes it clear.
今天我们已经介绍了很多机制
Today we've covered a lot of mechanism.
我们谈了很多关于不同的运动通路
We talked so much about the different motor pathway,
中央模式生成器
central pattern generator.
所以你现在掌握了很多信息
So you now are armed with a lot of information
关于你如何产生运动
about how you generate movement.
我希望你也具备了
And I like to think that you're also armed
很多关于如何设计工具方法的信息
with a lot of information about how to design protocols
为你自己优化  或如果你是教练
that are optimized for you or if you're a coach,
为你的学员优化
for your trainees in order to optimize
他们学习各种技能
their learning of skills various kinds.
今天我们几乎完全专注于运动技能
Today we focused almost entirely on motor skills,
诸如音乐技能或身体技能之类的东西
things like musical skills or physical skills.
这些与神经可塑性 有一些重叠  或者部分重叠
These have some overlap, they're partially overlapping
用于学习语言之类的东西
with neuroplasticity, for learning things like languages
或数学、工程或神经科学
or math or engineering or neuroscience for that matter.
在我们结束之前  我只想确认一下
Before we depart, I just want to make sure
我回到一个概念  那就是昼夜节律周期
that I return to a concept, which is the ultradian cycle.
昼夜节律周期是这些 90 分钟的周期
Ultradian cycles are these 90 minute cycles
我们在整个睡眠和清醒过程中都经历过
that we go through throughout sleep and wakefulness
最适合学习和注意力
that are optimal for learning and attention.
在清醒状态下  它们是睡眠的阶段
In the waking state, they are the stages of sleep
其中我们主要有慢速睡眠
in which we have either predominantly slowey sleep
或快速睡眠
or rem sleep.
你们中的一些人一直在关注这个播客
Some of you who have been following this podcast
有一段时间可能会问  是否应该进行体育锻炼
for a while might be asking, well should a physical practice
是 90 分钟
be 90 minutes.
这得看具体条件
That's going to depend because with physical practices,
通常身体练习  例如  力量训练
oftentimes for instance, with strength training,
那可能太长了
that might be too long.
你将无法产生足够的力输出
You're not going to be able to generate enough force output
去充分训练
for it to be worthwhile.
至于打高尔夫球  我不知道
For golfing, I don't know.
我从来没打过  但我所有打高尔夫球的朋友
I've never played golf with all my friends that play golf,
他们消失在高尔夫球场上好几个小时
they disappear onto the golf course for many hours.
所以我知道有很多步行和开车
So I know there's a lot of walking and driving
和其他东西  我什至听说有人
and other stuff, I even hear that somebody
有时会为你携带你的东西  但并非总是如此
carries your stuff around for you sometimes, not always.
但它会有所不同
But it's going to differ.
一场四小时的高尔夫比赛  你可能不会
A four hour golf game, you're probably not swinging
连续挥杆四个小时  所以这要看具体情况
the golf club for four hours, so it's going to depend.
我会说昼夜节律周期不一定
I would say that the ultradian cycle is not necessarily
在大多数情况下  这不一定是技能学习的良好约束
a good constraint for skill learning in most cases.
我应该说  对于那些
And I should say that for those of you that are short
日程很满  或时间有限的人
on time or have limited amounts of time,
10 分钟的高重复次数
10 minutes of maximum repetitions,
高强度的技能学习工作
maximum focus skill learning work is going
将会非常有益
to be very beneficial.
而两个小时的随意
Whereas two hours of kind of haphazard
不是真正专注的工作或你没有产生很多重复
not really focused work or where you're not generating
因为你在做
very many repetitions 'cause you're doing
重复几次然后你就在手机上发短信
few repetitions then you're texting on your phone
或者注意别的事情
or pay attention to something else,
这不会有好处
that's not going to be beneficial.
这真的是关于训练的密度
It's really about the density of training
在这个阶段中
inside of a session.
所以我认为你应该让...
So I think you should let the...
努力达到最大或接近最大密度
Work toward maximal or near maximum density
如果它们是失败的重复和失败
of repetitions and failures provided they're failures
这样你才可以安全地执行以加速技能学习
you can perform safely in order to accelerate skill learning
不要让一些随意  或在这种情况下
and don't let some arbitrary or in this case,
不要让昼夜节律阻止你
the ultradian constraint prevent you
去做那种练习
from engaging in that practice.
换句话说  投入工作  完成尽可能多的工作
In other words, get the work in, get as much work done
就像你可以在单位时间内一样
as you can per unit time.
基于科学  基于我所看到的
And based on the science, based on things that I've seen,
基于我现在参与的事情
based on things that I'm now involved in
与不同的社区  你会看到技能的提高
with various communities, you will see the skill improve
在各个阶段都有很大的不同
vastly at various stages.
有时开始有点口吃
Sometimes it's a little bit stutter start,
这并不总是线性改进
it's not always a linear improvement
但你会看到技能的惊人进步
but you will see incredible improvement in skill.

在前几集和本集中
In previous episodes and in this episode,
我提到了一些补充剂
I mentioned some supplements.
补充剂当然在各种事物中占有一席之地
Supplements certainly have their place for various things.
他们不是必需的  但很多人  包括我自己
They aren't necessary, but many people, including myself
从补充剂中获益
derive benefit from supplements
用于改善睡眠和免疫系统功能等方面
for things like improving sleep and immune system function
和学习等等
and learning and so forth.
如果你有兴趣看看我服用的补充剂
If you're interested in seeing the supplements that I take,
你可以去 thorne.com/u
you can go to thorne.com/u,
那是字母 U /Huberman
that's the letter U slash Huberman
你可以看到我服用的补充剂
and you can see the supplements that I take.
如果你想尝试这些补品中的任何一种
If you want to try any of those supplements,
你只需访问 Thorne 网页即可获得 20% 的折扣
you can get 20% off simply by accessing the Thorne webpage
通过该门户网站  以及 20% 的折扣
through that portal, as well as 20% off
索恩制造的任何其他补品
any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
我们与 Thorne 合作的原因
The reason we've partnered with Thorne
是因为索恩的严格程度最高
is because Thorne has the very highest levels of stringency
在补充剂的质量方面
in terms of the quality of the supplements
以及每种补充剂用量的准确性
and the accuracy about the amounts of each supplement
在瓶子里
that are in the bottle.
补充剂行业的主要问题之一
One of the major problems in the supplement industry
是当补充剂得到测试时
is that when supplements get tested,
通常情况下  给定成分的数量
often it's the case that the amount of a given ingredient
远低于或远高于报告的
is far lower or far greater than what's reported
在瓶子上
on the bottle.
索恩的情况并非如此
That's not the case for Thorne.
索恩的严格程度非常高
Thorne has very high levels of stringency,
他们与梅奥诊所合作
they partnered with the Mayo Clinic
和所有主要的运动队
and all the major sports teams
这也是我们与他们合作的原因
and that's why we partnered with them as well.
所以如果你想再次检查这些
So if you want to check those out again,
thorne/u/huberman
it's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E slash the letter U/Huberman
获得 Thorne 生产的任何补充剂 20% 的折扣
to get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
