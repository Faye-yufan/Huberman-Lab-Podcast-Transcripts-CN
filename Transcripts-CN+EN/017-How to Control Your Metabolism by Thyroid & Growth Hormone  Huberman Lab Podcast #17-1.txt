-欢迎来到Huberman Lab播客
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast
我们在这里讨论科学和日常生活中基于科学的工具
where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
[吉他音乐]
[guitar music]
我是Andrew Huberman  我是神经生物学和眼科教授
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
在斯坦福医学院
and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
此播客是单独的
This podcast is separate
与我在斯坦福大学的教学和研究职位无关
from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
但是  这是我渴望和努力的一部分
It is, however, part of my desire and effort
为消费者提供有关科学的零成本信息
to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
以及面向大众的与科学相关的工具
and science-related tools to the general public.
为了与该主题保持一致
In keeping with that theme,
我要感谢今天播客的赞助商
I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
我们的第一个赞助商是四西格玛
Our first sponsor is Four Sigmatic.
四西格玛是一家保健公司
Four Sigmatic is a wellness company
制作蘑菇咖啡
that makes mushroom coffee.
如果你问自己
And if you're asking yourself,
你为什么要在咖啡里放蘑菇？
why would you want to put mushrooms in coffee?
首先  我告诉你
First of all, let me tell you
这些不是迷幻蘑菇  不
these are not psychedelic mushrooms and no,
咖啡的味道不像蘑菇
the coffee doesn't taste like mushrooms.
咖啡很好吃
The coffee is delicious
而且你根本不会尝蘑菇
and you don't taste mushrooms at all.
我知道这是因为我一直在使用四西格玛咖啡
I know this because I've been using Four Sigmatic coffee
并已经在我的实验室中存放了几年了
and been stocking it in my laboratory for several years now
很久以前我没有播客
long before I ever had the podcast
或四西格米奇（Four Sigmatic）是赞助商
or Four Sigmatic was a sponsor.
四种西格玛咖啡中的两种蘑菇
The two kinds of mushrooms that are in Four Sigmatic coffee
我们的狮子的鬃毛和chaga蘑菇
our lion's mane and chaga mushrooms,
这两个都已经显示
both of which have been shown
具有轻微的抗焦虑作用  以减轻焦虑
to have a slight anxiolytic effect to reduce anxiety.
还有狮子的鬃毛
And lion's mane has also been shown
在几项研究中以减轻症状
in several studies to lower the symptoms
情绪低落
of depression just slightly.
尽管我不会将其视为抑郁症的治疗方法
Although I wouldn't consider it a treatment for depression,
这是一个诱人的好处
that's an attractive benefit,
并对抵消认知能力下降有一定作用
as well as have some effect at offsetting cognitive decline.
尽管有一点点  但效果是真实的
Albeit slightly, the effects were real
在我发现的研究中
in the studies that I've found.

今天的一集也由Blinkist带给我们
Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.
Blinkist是一款拥有数千个应用程序
Blinkist is an app that has thousands
非小说类书籍的压缩时间仅为15分钟
of nonfiction books condensed down to just 15 minutes
你可以阅读或聆听的关键小菜一碟
of key takeaways that you can read or listen to.
我是一个大读者  也是一个非小说类读者
I'm a big reader and I'm a big consumer of nonfiction.
而且大部分时间我都在读书
And most of the time I consume books
像书一样以传统形式
in their traditional form like a book
在这里翻转页面等等
where you flip the pages and so forth.
我也听全长有声读物
I also listen to full length audio books.
但是  随着时间的流逝  我们知道我们会忘记很多事情
However, over time we know that we forget lots of things.
即使有时我想
And even though sometimes I think
我从一本书中获得了所有关键信息
I got all the critical information from a book,
当我听Blinkist的音乐时  我得到了15分钟的播放时间
when I listen to Blinkist and I get the 15-minute rundown,
音频或书面形式
either an audio or in written form,
我发现有很多我经常错过的要点
what I find is there key points that oftentimes I missed.
因此  这是我俩一起慢跑记忆的好方法
And so it's a great way for me to both jog my memory
并提出想法
and to bring forward ideas
我以前没有考虑过
that I hadn't considered previously.
他们有成千上万的非小说类书籍
They have thousands of nonfiction titles
还有一些在科学类别中非常出色的
and some really terrific ones in the science category.
例如  大卫·伊格曼（David Eagleman）的书“ Livewired”
For example, David Eagleman's book "Livewired"
最近以我阅读的全书形式问世
which came out recently as a book I read in full length form
而且我也听过它的Blinkist版本
and I've listened to the Blinkist version of it as well.
“ Livewired”是一本关于神经可塑性的书
"Livewired" is a book
about neuroplasticity.
大脑响应经验而改变的能力
The brain's ability to change in response to experience.
我有很多问题和要求
I get so many questions and requests
有关神经可塑性的书籍
for books about neuroplasticity.
我认为“ Livewired”是最新的
In my opinion, "Livewired" is the most recent
和最新的  最好的一个
and up-to-date and the best one to date.
在那里
So that's there.
大卫·辛克莱（David Sinclair）的著作《寿命》
David Sinclair's book "Lifespan."
大卫  你们中很多人都知道
David, as many of you know,
是哈佛医学院遗传学教授
is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.
“寿命”是一本关于衰老作为一种疾病的绝妙书
"Lifespan" is this terrific
book about aging as a disease
以及长寿疗法的未来和现在
and the future and present of longevity treatments.
非常有趣的书
Very interesting book.
以及马特·沃克（Mat Walker）的书“我们为什么要睡觉”
As well as Matt Walker's book, "Why We Sleep."
马特（Matt）当然是加州大学伯克利分校（UC Berkeley）的教授
Matt, of course, is a professor at UC Berkeley
《为什么睡觉》是一本很棒的书
and "Why We Sleep" is a terrific book
关于我们为什么睡觉  关于睡眠的科学
about why we sleep, the science of sleeping,
以及你可以做的改善睡眠的事情
and things you can do to improve your sleep.
所有这些都在Blinkist上
All of those are on Blinkist.
但是通过Blinkist  你可以无限制地访问
But with Blinkist you get unlimited access
到他们庞大的非小说图书馆
to their massive library of nonfiction.

这集也由Munk Pack带给我们
This episode is also brought to us by Munk Pack.
Munk Pack是一家生产可食用酮类小吃的公司
Munk Pack is a company that makes keto-friendly snacks
味道令人难以置信
that taste incredible
但只有一克或更少的糖
but have just one gram of sugar or less.
就像我之前在这个播客上说的  我不是酮症患者
As I've said before on this podcast, I am not in ketosis.
我不是生酮的
I'm not ketogenic.
我不提倡或遵循任何一种特定的饮食习惯
I don't advocate or follow any one particular diet.
对我来说  有效的方法是在一天的早期禁食
For me, what works is to fast in the early part of the day
并全天吃低碳水化合物和酮类食品
and to eat low carb and keto-ish throughout the day.
这是为了保持警觉和注意
That's for alertness and attention.
这样我就可以集中精力
So I can work and focus
而且我不会感到呆滞或头脑迷雾
and I don't feel sluggish or brain fog.
然后在晚上和晚上
And then at night and in the evening
当我倾向于吃碳水化合物时
is when I tend to eat my carbohydrates
帮助过渡到睡眠
to aid the transition to sleep.
那对我有用
That's what works for me.
蒙克派酒吧是很棒的小吃
Munk Pack bars are a terrific snack
不管你是否一直都是酮
whether or not you're keto all the time,
不管你是否低碳水化合物
whether or not you're low carb,
甚至即使你不是  它们也绝对好吃
or even if you're not, they are absolutely delicious.
我也不会轻易地说出来
And I don't say that lightly.
总的来说  我不是酒吧的忠实拥护者
I'm not a big fan of bars in general.
对我来说  大多数酒吧的味道都像是
Most bars to me tastes like a combination of, you know,
装有一些硬纸板的金属保险杠
a metal bumper mixed with some cardboard
还有一些草坪饰物和一些人造糖
and some lawn trimmings and some artificial sugar.
Munk Pack酒吧  当它们寄给我时
Munk Pack bars, when they were sent to me,
我当时想  好的  我会尝试的
I was like, all right, I'll try them.
我尝试过这个
I tried it.
就像  嗯  这是一个问题
Like, uh-oh, this is a problem
因为我非常非常喜欢他们
'cause I liked them very, very much.
当我说这是一个问题时  确实是一个问题
And when I say it's a problem, it really is a problem.
我实际上将Munk Pack盒子放在地下室
I actually keep the Munk Pack boxes in my basement
这样我就不会一次全部撕毁它们
so that I don't tear through them all at once.
我是焦糖海盐口味的忠实粉丝
I'm a huge fan of the caramel sea salt flavor.
这很美味
It's delicious.
只是谈论它就让我很饿
Just talking about it makes me hungry for one.
但是他们也有海盐
But they also have sea salt,
黑巧克力  花生酱  黑巧克力
dark chocolate, peanut butter dark chocolate.
他们太棒了
They're terrific.
除了对keto友好之外
In addition to being keto-friendly,
它们也是无麸质  植物性的
they're also gluten-free, plant-based,
非转基因  无大豆  反式脂肪
non-GMO, no soy, trans fat,
糖醇或人造色素
sugar alcohols or artificial colors.
因此  所有你不想要的坏东西
So all the bad stuff that you don't want.
正如我之前提到的  它们是酮
And as I mentioned before, they're keto,
少于一克糖
less than one gram of sugar.

这个月  我们一直在谈论激素
This month, we've been talking all about hormones,
这些绝对不可思议的化学物质
which are these absolutely incredible chemicals
在我们的大脑和身体中
in our brain and body.
它们影响了我们的整个寿命
They impact our entire lifespan.
所以从我们进入子宫的那一刻起
So from the time that we are in the womb,
它们控制着发育
they're controlling the development
我们的大脑和身体
of our brain and our bodies.
我们出生后  他们仍然在控制
After we are born, they're still controlling
我们的大脑和身体的发育
the development of our brain and bodies.
我确实说的是发育
And I did say development,
这是因为  与大多数人的想法相反
and that's because, contrary to what most people think,
发育持续整个生命周期
development lasts the entire lifespan.
从受孕到死亡
From the time you're conceived until the time you die,
你一直在发育  你正在改变
you are developing, you are changing.
荷尔蒙不断更新和变化
And hormones are constantly updating and changing
你身体的不同功能
the different functions of your body.
它们有两种主要的影响
They have two major kinds of effects.
一种是立竿见影的效果  因此它们实际上可以绑定到
One are immediate effects, so they can actually bind to
或在牢房的停车位上停放某种公园
or kind of park in parking spots on cells
并影响各种各样的事情
and impact all sorts of things
像细胞的生长等等
like the growth of cells, et cetera.
它们还可以控制基因表达
They also can control gene expression.
这是青春期荷尔蒙分泌的方式
This is the way that hormones during puberty
控制身体的头发生长和乳房发育
control body hair growth and breast development
和四肢的肌肉生长和身高
and growth of muscles and limbs and height
还有各种各样的事情
and all sorts of things.
他们太不可思议了
They are incredible.
我们已经讨论过睾丸激素和雌激素
We've talked about testosterone and estrogen.
我们谈到了胰岛素和胰高血糖素
We talked about insulin and glucagon
还有其他一些东西
and some of the other things.
今天  我们将谈论新陈代谢
Today, we are going to talk about metabolism.
主要要说说甲状腺激素
Mainly going to talk about thyroid hormone
以及生长激素和其他一些相关通路
and growth hormone and some other related pathways.
我将向你解释逻辑
I'm going to explain to you the logic
甲状腺激素和生长激素如何工作
of how thyroid hormone and growth hormone work.
我为什么把甲状腺和生长激素放在同一期里讲
It will become obvious why I've paired thyroid
之后你们就会知道为什么了  显而易见
and growth hormone together in the same episode.
我当然会谈谈工具方法
And I will of course talk about tools
可以用来提升或减少甲状腺激素
that you can use to elevate or reduce thyroid hormone.
在某些情况下  人们希望减少甲状腺激素
There are cases where people want to reduce thyroid hormone.
我将讨论你可以使用的工具
I will talk about tools that you can use
来提升生长激素
to elevate growth hormone.
在少数情况下  人们
There are rare cases where people
要减少生长激素
want to reduce growth hormone.
大多数人都对增加生长激素感兴趣
Most people are interested in increasing growth hormone.
因此  今天将充满干货
So today is going to be rich with information,
丰富的可行工具
rich with actionable tools.
和往常一样  这个想法是阐明
And as always, the idea is to spell out
组织逻辑  这样你就可以离开
an organizational logic so you can come away
从这个播客  事实上
from this episode and in fact
整个月服用激素
the entire month on hormones,
在一定程度上真正理解
really understanding at some level
这些所谓的荷尔蒙是什么以及它们如何发挥作用
what these things we call hormones are and how they work.
这真的可以让你充满知识   当遇到不确定信息的时候
And that's really to arm you to encounter information
不管它是否来自我
going forward, whether or not it comes from me
或其他人的书或课程
or from somebody else, a book or a course,
在网上其他地方了解如何工作
someplace else online to make sense of how to work
这些不可思议的化学物质被称为激素
with these incredible chemicals we call hormones.
在我们开始谈论甲状腺和生长激素之前
Before we begin to talk about thyroid and growth hormone
以及我们的新陈代谢如何运作以及如何控制新陈代谢
and how our metabolism works and how to control metabolism,
我想回答我收到的一些问题
I want to answer a few questions that I received
从观众那里
from you from the audience.
每过一段时间
Every once in a while,
有人会给我一个很认真的问题
someone will send me a quite earnest question
关于他们在互联网上看到的内容
about something they saw on the internet.
我听说过的一件事
And one of the things I've heard about quite a bit
在过去的几周里  我们一直在谈论
in the last couple of weeks as we've been talking
关于激素和食物的摄入量以及它们如何相互作用
about hormones and food intake and how those interact
这个问题是  某些食物
is this question of are certain foods
是不是对身体的某些器官特别有益？
particularly good for certain organs of the body?
并且可以
And can that be predicted
根据那些食物的形状来预测判断？
on the basis of the shape of those foods?
所以首先  我想说的是这个问题
So first of all, I want to acknowledge the question
是一个正经问题
as a valid one, because I see this
因为我每隔一段时间就会看到
every once in a while out there.
人们会说  嗯
People will say, well, you know,
核桃是大脑的形状
walnuts are in the shape of the brain
因此它们对你的大脑有益  或者
and therefore they are good for your brain or, you know,
像甜菜这样的特殊水果通常看起来像一颗心
a particular fruit like the beet often looks like a heart
对你的心脏有好处
and it's good for your heart.
我当然高兴看到大家提出各种问题
And I certainly invite questions of all kinds,
只要是真诚的问题
provided they're sincere questions.
但是  我现在不知道有任何科学表明
However, I am not aware of any science whatsoever
对于某种食物形状的想法
supporting the idea that the shape of a given food
或与此相关的对象
or object for that matter is relevant
它在生物学中对人体的功能作用
to its functional role in the body in reference to biology.
那么  甜菜含有一种物质
Now, beets contain something
今天我们等等要谈论的
that we're going to talk about today.
它们含有一种叫做精氨酸的物质
They contain a substance called arginine,
实际上可以控制扩张
which actually can control the dilation
血管和动脉
of blood vessels and arteries.
因此  它与心脏和心脏健康有一定关系
So it has some relationship to heart and heart health.
核桃含有各种脂肪酸
Walnuts contain various fatty acids
也许  我想强调一下
that maybe, I want to underscore maybe,
对大脑健康的某些方面有益
beneficial for certain aspects of brain health
但没有任何证据说明
but there's no evidence whatsoever
食物营养与本身的形状是相关的
that the shape of the food itself is relevant.
而且  我认为实际上
And, you know, I think what's happened is,
大家在网上
is that people have gone out there
发现含有某些物质的食物
and found foods that contain certain substances
像胡萝卜和维生素A
like carrots and vitamin A
或核桃以及特定的脂肪酸
or walnuts and particular fatty acids
或甜菜和精氨酸
or beets and arginine.
他们选择了这些食物
And they've selected the foods
碰巧是器官的形状
that happen to be in the shape of the thing,
特定物质如维生素A的器官
the organ that the particular substance like vitamin A
或脂肪酸等可能有益或支持
or fatty acids and so forth might benefit or support.
但是当然  还有许多其他来源
But of course, there are many, many other sources
这些不是来自核桃的营养素
of these nutrients that don't come from walnuts
或甜菜或胡萝卜
or from beets or from carrots.
所以我想简单来说
And so I guess the short way to put it
就是一些食物的形状
is that the idea that the shape of some food
与表明该食物是否能帮助
is an indication of whether or not that food
身体中的特定器官的健康
would be healthy for a particular organ in the body
这是完全没有根据的
is absolutely unfounded.
我不知道有任何的证据
I don't know of any evidence for it
我并不想打消任何人对某种食物的喜爱
and I'm not out to quash anybody's great love of these foods.
我喜欢我刚才描述的所有食物
I enjoy all the foods I just described,
但是物质在宇宙中的形状
but the shape of things in the physical universe
与其中包含的营养
bears very little, if any, relevance
其对某种器官的有益  这两者几乎没有任何相关性
to the nutrients that it contains and therefore the organs that it supports.
所以谢谢你的问题
So thank you for your question
但是如果你看到网上这么说
but if you see that out there,
我甚至不认为你需要告诉那个人
I don't even think you need to tell the person
那些将这些信息释出给世界的人
who's putting that information out into the world.
不如选择战术性后退
I would just, you know, back away slowly.
另一方面  在我们探讨今天的材料之前
One other thing, before we move into today's material,
上一集  我谈到了问题
last episode, I talked about the problems
在高度加工的食品中使用乳化剂
with emulsifiers in highly processed foods
以及他们剥离的方式
and the way that they can strip
肠粘膜衬里
the mucosal lining of the gut.
它们可以限制CCK等激素的信号传导
And they can limit the signaling of hormones like CCK
可以预示着大脑的饱腹感
that can signal to the brain satiety,
停止进食的信号
the signal to stop eating.
然后我们进行了讨论
And then we got into a discussion
关于人造甜味剂
about artificial sweeteners
我把甜叶菊当作人造甜味剂讲了
and I threw out Stevia as an artificial sweetener.
有几个人提出异议来纠正我
And several people reached out to correct me
甜叶菊不是人造甜味剂
that Stevia is not an artificial sweetener,
它是一种无热量的甜味剂  是的你们是正确的
it is a noncaloric sweetener, and you are correct.
我将人造甜味剂和非热量甜味剂混在一起了
I lumped artificial and noncaloric sweeteners together.
感谢你们中的许多人  也给我提供了一些参考
And thanks to many of you that also sent me some references.
甜菊似乎对肠道微生物组没有负面影响
It does not appear that Stevia can negatively impact the gut microbiome.
在无热量甜味剂中  它似乎确实是独一无二的
It does seem unique among noncaloric sweeteners.
可能还有其他物质  我们还不知道
There are probably others out there.
我们讨论的另一件事是甜叶菊
The other thing that we discussed is how Stevia
会导致血糖轻度升高
can lead to slight increases in blood glucose
但也可以稍微改善胰岛素管理
but can also improve insulin management just slightly,
就其对血糖的影响而言  可能会抵消为零
probably cancels to zero in terms of its impact on blood glucose,
因为它没有特别的甜
provided it's not at concentrations that are super, super sweet.
摄入任何非常甜的东西
Ingestion of anything that's very sweet,
不论是否含有卡路里  人造的与否
whether or not contains calories or not, artificial or not,
都将产生胰岛素反应
will create an insulin response.
实际上  只是走过一家面包店
In fact, just walking past a bakery
闻到美味的烘焙食品
and smelling delicious baked goods
都可以增加你的胰岛素分泌
can increase your insulin secretion.
因此  我们只想指出这一点
And so we just want to point that out.
感谢你的信息
Thank you for the information
以及你找到的参考
and the references that you found.
如果找到其他邮件  请发送其他邮件
Please send additional ones if you do find them.
我感谢你允许我进行更正
And I appreciate that you allow me to make corrections
每隔一段时间我必须在这里讲话
every once in a while I must speak here
并有机会进行更正
and the opportunity to make corrections
让我们所有人都在同一页面上
keeps us all on the same page.
并且请保留你的任何反馈意见
And please do keep any feedback that you have
关于我将在这里介绍的特定内容
about particular things I cover here coming my way.
大家对新陈代谢的兴趣很大
There is so much interest in metabolism.
我们听说过新陈代谢过高或过低
We hear about having a high or a low metabolism.
网上经常有人
There are some people out there
喊着想要减少他们的新陈代谢
who would like to reduce their metabolism.
他们根本无法吃足够的食物来维持体重
They simply can't eat enough to maintain their weight.
但是  大多数人都在与相反的问题作斗争
Most people, however, struggle with the opposite issue.
他们努力保持健康的体重
They struggle to maintain a healthy weight
他们的新陈代谢过低
and/or their metabolism is too low.
那么  有多种原因
Now, there are a variety of reasons
为什么新陈代谢会很低
why metabolism can be low.
今天  我们要讨论两种激素
Today, we are going to talk about two hormones,
甲状腺激素及其相关通路
thyroid hormone and its related pathways
以及生长激素及其相关通路
and growth hormone and it's related pathways,
可以说是两种激素
which arguably are the two hormones
身体中最重要的两个系统
and two systems in the body that are most significant
用于设置新陈代谢的整体水平
for setting your overall level of metabolism.
在我们深入探讨这些之前
Before we dive into those,
我只想介绍一下什么是新陈代谢
I just want to cover a little bit of what metabolism is.
我想谈谈你体内的哪些器官
And I want to talk about which organs in your body
消耗最大的能量
use the most energy.
所以新陈代谢就是能量的消耗
So metabolism is the consumption of energy,
不一定吃
not necessarily eating,
但这是利用人体细胞中能量
but it's the use of energy in the cells of the body
用于组织生长  用于组织修复
for growth of tissues, for repair of tissues,
并且也仅用于日常维护功能
and also just for day-to-day maintenance of function.
维护功能的好例子
A good example of maintenance of function
将是你的大脑
would be your brain.
你大部分的新陈代谢需求
Most of your metabolic needs,
你所谓的基础代谢或静息代谢需求
your so-called basal or resting metabolic needs
是为了你的大脑  为了思维
are for your brain, for thinking.
如果你整天坐在床上
If you were to just sit in a bed all day
除了思考  什么都不做
and do nothing but think,
消耗大约75％的新陈代谢需求
that consumes about 75% of your metabolic needs.
那么  也正在四处走动
Now, there's also moving around.
如果你的工作需要繁重的工作
If you have a job that requires a lot of heavy labor
或举重或你是新父母
or lifting things or you're a new parent
而且你带着孩子们到处走
and you're carrying kids around
而你正在上下楼梯
and you're going up and down the stairs
或来来回回走到冰箱
or back and forth to the refrigerator for formula, et cetera,
好了  那么你就在燃烧更多的能量  燃烧更多的卡路里
well then you're burning more energy, burning more calories.
但是  即使你身体非常活跃
But even if you are very physically active,
除非你是超级马拉松运动员或马拉松运动员
unless you're an ultra marathoner or a marathoner,
可能你的新陈代谢需求的75％
chances are that 75% of your metabolic needs
都是来自你的大脑
are coming just from your brain.
那是因为神经元消耗大量能量
And that's because neurons consume a lot of energy.
当然  神经元只是大脑的神经细胞
Neurons, of course, are just the nerve cells of your brain.
所以这两种激素  甲状腺激素和生长激素
So these two hormones, thyroid hormone and growth hormone,
我们认为这与体内事物的新陈代谢有关
we think of as related to metabolism of things in the body,
保持体内低脂肪  保持肌肉强壮
keeping body fat low, and keeping muscles strong,
和肌腱强壮并自我修复  等等
and tendons strong and repairing themselves, et cetera,
但它们也是大脑功能的关键
but they are also key for brain function,
保持认知功能的能力
for the ability to maintain cognitive function
在整个生命周期中
throughout the lifespan.
所以我想介绍一个大主题
So the big theme I'd like to introduce
是新陈代谢不只是减肥
is that metabolism isn't just about losing weight
但是新陈代谢很高
but having a high metabolism,
只要它不太高  那就好
provided it's not too high, is great.
这意味着你将拥有更多的瘦组织
It means that you will have more lean tissue,
骨骼和肌肉更多  而脂肪组织  脂肪更少
more bone and muscle and less adipose tissue, fat.
而且我们知道那是健康的
And we know that that's healthy.
多少脂肪和多少肌肉？
How much fat and how much muscle?
嗯  这有所不同
Well, that varies,
而且这个数字总是在变化
and the numbers on this are always shifting.
但一般来说  肌肉及其相关组织
But in general, muscle and its related tissues
比脂肪组织或脂肪消耗更多的能量
burns more energy than does adipose tissue or fat.
而且你体内的水不会消耗任何能量
And the water in your body doesn't consume any energy.
所以可以增加新陈代谢
So metabolism can be increased
简单地通过增加肌肉到你的身体
simply by adding muscle to your body
并减少脂肪或调整两者的比例
and reducing fat or adjusting the ratio of the two.
但是不管  即使你不感兴趣
But regardless, even if you're not interested
在改变身体成分时  这两种激素
in changing body composition, these two hormones,
甲状腺激素和生长激素
thyroid hormone and growth hormone,
对各种新陈代谢都非常重要
are super important for metabolism of all kinds,
包括受伤后的组织修复
including tissue repair after injury,
包括维持认知功能
including maintaining cognitive function
和幸福感以及随着年龄增长而清晰思考的能力
and well-being and the ability to think clearly as you age,
抵消痴呆症等等
offsetting dementia and so forth.
因此  这里的大主题确实包括以前的播客
So the big theme here really includes the previous episodes.
你不必看过这些播客
You don't have to have seen those episodes
但对于最后三集以及今天
but for the last three episodes and today as well,
我们一直在谈论激素
we've been talking about hormones,
从一个位置释放的这些物质
these substances that are released from one location
在身体中扮演其他角色
in the body that go and act other locations in the body.
我要告诉你它是如何工作的
I'm going to tell you how that works
用于甲状腺和生长激素
for thyroid and growth hormone.
但是现在你已经听说过睾丸激素和雌激素
But now that you've heard about testosterone and estrogen
然后你将听到有关甲状腺和生长激素的信息
and you're going to hear about thyroid and growth hormone,
我希望你认识到有一些重复的大逻辑
I want you to realize that there's a repeating logic.
首先  你的大脑中有神经元
First of all, there are neurons in your brain
在下丘脑区域
in an area called the hypothalamus,
这只是意味着它在丘脑下方  下垂
which just means it's below the thalamus, hypo.
它位于你的大脑底部
It sits at the base of your brain,
在前面  它是前脑的一部分
in the front, it's part of the forebrain.
因此  它或多或少在你的嘴顶上方
So it's more or less above the roof of your mouth,
大概一公分左右
maybe about a centimeter or so,
然后在大多数人中向前大约一厘米
and then about a centimeter forward in most people.
下丘脑中的神经元释放激素
And neurons in the hypothalamus release hormones
被称为释放激素
that are called releasing hormones.
所以我们在前几集中谈到了
So we've talked in previous episodes
关于例如促性腺激素释放激素
about, for instance, gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
所以那是一些神经元  然后发出信号
So those are a little neurons that then signal
呼叫另一个大脑区域  叫做“垂体”
another brain area called the pituitary
让它释放其他激素
to release other hormones.
今天  我们将再次看到这一点
Today, we're going to see this again.
在大脑中  你的神经元释放促甲状腺激素
In the brain, you have neurons that release thyrotropin
或甲状腺释放激素
or thyroid-releasing hormone.
你也有生长激素释放激素
You also have growth hormone-releasing hormone.
因此  每当你听到“释放”时
So anytime you hear releasing,
基本上就是那些在大脑中的神经元
chances are those are neurons that are in your brain
它们会延伸一些小丝  我们称之为轴突
and they extend little wires we call axons
进入你的垂体
into your pituitary and the pituitary
然后垂体将一堆激素释放到血液中
releases a bunch of hormones into the bloodstream.
垂体 “释放”的东西
And the pituitary releases things
名称中经常带有“刺激性...荷尔蒙”
that most often have the name of stimulating hormone
因为它们直接刺激器官
because they stimulate organs.
因此  为了符合甲状腺激素的主题
So in keeping with the theme of thyroid hormone,
你的大脑中有“甲状腺释放激素  ”
you have thyroid-releasing hormone in the brain,
告诉垂体释放“促甲状腺激素”
tells the pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating hormone
然后是我们稍后要说到的  甲状腺
and then the thyroid, which we'll talk about in a moment,
甲状腺释放甲状腺激素
releases thyroid hormones.
在睾丸激素和雌激素事件中
In the testosterone and estrogen episode,
我们谈到了你如何释放促性腺激素
we talked about how you have gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
在大脑中又有释放
there's the releasing again, up in the brain.
记住  释放激素来自大脑
Remember, releasing hormone comes from the brain.
然后你有黄体生成激素之类的东西
Then you had things like luteinizing hormone
和促卵泡激素
and follicle-stimulating hormone,
垂体分泌 然后被运输到
which were in the pituitary and those traveled
卵巢或睾丸
to the ovaries or the testes
并作用在那些组织上  好吧
and acted on those tissues, okay?
因此  请尝试深深地记住此逻辑
So please try and embed this logic.
如果你听到“释放激素”一词
If you hear the word releasing hormone,
它基本上是来自大脑  这使它具有可行性
it's coming from the brain, and that makes it actionable
以某些方式  我们稍后会回过来讲
in certain ways that we'll return to later.
另外  垂体让所有这些激素
In addition, the pituitary is letting go
进入血液
of all these hormones into the bloodstream
刺激不同的组织
that are stimulating different tissues.
因此  对于甲状腺来说  它是促甲状腺激素
So for thyroid, it's thyroid-stimulating hormone.
然后它进入甲状腺
And then it goes to the thyroid.
甲状腺是一个小蝴蝶状的腺体
And the thyroid is a little butterfly-shaped gland
就在亚当的苹果（喉结）周围
that's right around the Adam's apple.
如果你想看自己的  直接看不到
If you want to see yours, not directly
因为它上面有皮肤
'cause it's got skin over it,
你可以喝一口水
what you would do is you'd take a sip of water,
你会照镜子  然后会吞咽
you'd look in the mirror and you'd swallow.
上下移动的是甲状腺
And the thing that moves up and down, that is your thyroid.
那么  有人称它为你的亚当的苹果（喉结）
Now, some people call it your Adam's apple
因为它正好位于气管突出处附近
because it sits right near this protrusion in the trachea,
这是亚当的苹果（喉结）
which is the Adam's apple.
不管你是男是女
No matter, whether or not you're male, female,
或不管你的染色体背景是什么
or regardless of what your chromosomal background is,
每个人都有一个亚当的苹果
everyone has an Adam's apple.
它在在发育的早期睾丸激素上升快的人身上
It tends to be more pronounced in people
往往更明显
that got a surge of testosterone early in development
因为它对睾丸激素敏感
because it has a testosterone sensitivity to it.
这实际上控制了音色
And that actually controls the timbre,
所谓的声音深沉
the so-called deepness of the voice.
所以甲状腺就在那里
So the thyroid gland sits right there
它后面有四个小凸起
and it's got four little bumps behind it
叫做甲状旁腺
called the parathyroid gland.
并释放两种激素到血液中
And it releases two hormones into the blood
刺激不同的组织及其新陈代谢
to stimulate different tissues and their metabolism.
这些激素称为T4和T3
And those hormones are called T4 and T3.
如果这听起来已经有点难了  别担心
So if this is already sounding
我保证  就像很多之前讲的内容一样  这真的很容易
like a lot of information, it's really easy, I promise.
释放激素来自大脑
Releasing hormone comes from the brain.
刺激性激素来自垂体
Stimulating hormone comes from the pituitary.
在这种情况下  我们谈论的是甲状腺
And in this case, we're talking about the thyroid,
捆绑刺激性激素并说  哦
binding up that stimulating hormone and saying, oh,
我要释放点东西
I need to release something.
并释放T4和T3
And it releases T4 and T3.
你猜怎么着？
And guess what?
你基本上可以忘记T4
You can basically forget about T4.
T4  它虽然不是完全不活动  它有一些作用
T4, it's not completely inactive, it has some roles,
但是T3或多或少更加活跃
but T3 is the one that's more or less active.
那么  甲状腺激素有什么作用？
Now, what does thyroid hormone do?
很多人认为  哦  甲状腺
A lot of people think, oh, thyroid,
就像是新陈代谢和甲状腺功能亢进的人
it's like metabolism and people who are hyperthyroidal
眼睛鼓鼓  很瘦
have bulging eyes and are real thin
甲状腺功能减退的人超重
and people who have hypothyroid are overweight
他们的眼睛就像
and their eyes are like are, you know,
半封闭或什么
half closed or something.
确实是甲状腺激素的控制
And indeed thyroid hormone controls
面部和眼睛的许多特征
a lot of the features of the face and the eyes.
而且它可以控制脂肪组织等的数量
And it can control amounts of adipose tissue and so forth.
但是  甲状腺激素的主要作用是T3
But the main role of thyroid hormone, of T3,
是促进新陈代谢
is to promote metabolism.
这不仅仅意味着能源的消耗
And that doesn't just mean the consumption of energy,
这意味着能源的利用
it means the utilization of energy,
包括组织堆积
including the buildup of tissues.
因此  它作用于体内的各种目标组织
So it acts on all sorts of target tissues in the body.
它作用于肌肉  作用于肝脏
It acts on muscle, it acts on the liver,
它作用于软骨  作用于骨骼
it acts on the cartilage, it acts on the bone.
它不仅涉及能源消耗
And it's not just involved in using energy,
它也在转换能量
it's also converting energy.
我的确意识到我说了两次
I do realize I said that twice.
它与脂肪有关
It's involved in taking fats
然后将它们分解成脂肪酸
and breaking them down into fatty acids
并将其转换为ATP
and converting those into ATP,
对于细胞利用能量而言  这很重要
which is an important thing for cells to use energy.
它也参与糖的摄取
It's also involved in taking sugars
并将它们转化为能量
and turning those into energy.
是的  它可以使脂肪组织变胖
And yes, it goes to adipose tissue to fat.
今天我们要谈论的脂肪种类繁多
We have different kinds of fat that we'll talk about today
但它会变成白色脂肪
but it goes to white fat
它会释放或帮助释放一些脂肪
and it liberates or helps liberate some of the fats
从这些脂肪细胞中获取能量
from those fat cells and use them for energy.
这就是为什么甲状腺素高
And this is why higher thyroid
与瘦身相关
is associated with leaner bodies.
更低的甲状腺激素水平  往往人不会那么瘦
Lower thyroid is associated with less lean bodies.
因此  一件事绝对是关键并且是可行的
So one thing that's absolutely key and is actionable,
我们已经在讨论工具了  是碘
we're right there already in discussing tools is iodine.
碘来自海洋中的东西  对不对？
Iodine comes from things in the ocean, right?
以下是有关碘的一些有趣的事实
And here are a couple of interesting facts about iodine.
然后我们将讨论是否
And then we'll talk about whether or not
你应该补充碘还是不补充碘
you should be supplementing iodine or not.
首先  碘是最常见的
First of all, iodine is most common
海盐  海带和海藻中
in sea salt, in kelp and in seaweed.
而且大多数人都能得到足够的碘
And most people can get enough iodine
从他们吃的食物和/或食用的食盐中获取
from the food they eat and/or the table salt they consume.
几乎所有来自世界各地的食盐
Almost all table salt from all over the world,
无论你身在何处  都含有碘
regardless of where you are, contains iodine.
甲状腺需要碘
The thyroid needs iodine
为了产生甲状腺激素
in order to produce thyroid hormone.
而且你需要足够水平的甲状腺激素
And you need sufficient levels of thyroid hormone,
不用太多  但是你需要它
not too much, but you need it.
因此  你有可能摄入足够的碘
So chances are you are getting enough iodine.
虽然你可能不会
Although, you might not,
特别是你们中那些特别想吃
especially those of you following a particularly,
“干净饮食”的人
quote, unquote, clean diet,
可能摄入的碘不足
might not be getting enough iodine.
这是碘的问题
Here's the deal with iodine.
碘与氨基酸结合
Iodine combines with an amino acid
我们之前所说的L-酪氨酸
that we've talked about before called L-tyrosine.
L-酪氨酸来自肉  来自坚果
L-tyrosine comes from meat, from nuts.
也有一些基于植物的资源
There are some plant-based sources as well.
它是多巴胺的前体
It is the precursor to dopamine.
但是在甲状腺中  碘会结合或起作用
But in the thyroid, iodine combines or works
与L-酪氨酸一起产生甲状腺激素T3和T4
with L-tyrosine to produce T3 and T4, the thyroid hormone.
因此  你绝对需要足够的碘
So you absolutely need sufficient iodine,
你需要足够的L-酪氨酸
you need sufficient L-tyrosine,
然后你还需要其他东西
and then you also need something else,
这就是所谓的硒
which is called selenium.
稍后我们将讨论硒
And we'll talk about selenium in a moment.
所以有一个情况出现了
So there's a condition that shows up
在世界上的部分地区
in little pockets in the world.
这不是超级常见  这意味着它不是很普及
It's not super common, meaning it's not very widespread,
但在远离海洋的某些地区
but in certain areas that are far away from the ocean,
在某一个时间段  也就是历史上
at one point, this was historically
在美国中西部各州
in the Midwestern states of the United States,
在其他国家的一些山区
in some mountain regions of other countries,
在非洲一些远离海洋的地区
in some areas of Africa that were far from the ocean,
人们的脖子会出现极度肿胀的凸起
people would get extremely swollen bulges in their necks.
这就是所谓的甲状腺肿大
And this was called goiter.
以及他们得到那些肿胀的原因
And the reason they were getting those swollen bulges
是因为甲状腺本身肥大
is because the thyroid itself was hypertrophying.
它正在努力增加甲状腺的分泌
It was growing in an attempt to churn out more thyroid.
而且因为它变得越来越多
And because it was getting a lot
垂体刺激激素
of stimulating hormone from the pituitary.
我不想在这里说的太多
And I don't want to go too far off track here
但是正如你回想的那样
but as you recall,
大脑和垂体正在关注
the brain and the pituitary are paying attention
在细胞意义上讲  是血液中激素的水平
in a cellular sense to the levels of hormones in the blood.
当这些激素过高时
And when those hormones get too high,
他们关闭了刺激性激素
they shut off the stimulating hormone,
他们关闭信号以分泌更多
they shut down the signal to make more,
有点像恒温器
kind of like a thermostat.
当水平太低时
When the levels are too low,
也就是血液中的睾丸激素不足
like there's not enough testosterone in the bloodstream
或雌激素不足
or there's not enough estrogen,
大脑将继续发出信号以产生更多的信号
the brain will continue to push out the signal to make more.
同样  如果没有足够的甲状腺循环
Similarly, if there's not enough thyroid circulating
或碘不足以制造甲状腺
or there's not enough iodine to make thyroid,
因此甲状腺激素循环不足
therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating,
甲状腺本身并未关闭
the thyroid gland itself is not getting shut down.
有大量的刺激性激素
There's tons of stimulating hormone
并释放来自大脑的荷尔蒙
and releasing hormone coming from the brain,
如释放  释放  释放
like release, release, release,
他们不可能制造甲状腺激素
and there's no way they can make thyroid hormone
所以腺体越来越大
and so the gland just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
这样人们就变得甲状腺肿了
And so people get goiter.
这就是食盐中含碘的原因之一
This is one of the reasons why table salt has iodine in it.
虽然还有其他食物
Although there are other foods
里面也有碘
that have iodine in it as well.
那么  你需要多少碘？
So how much iodine do you need?
好吧  你不需要很多
Well, you don't need a whole lot.
有些甲状腺功能减退的人可能会
Some people who are hypothyroidal might,
我想强调一下
and I want to emphasize might,
你绝对要与你的医生讨论
you absolutely should talk to your doctor.
这是一个严重的问题
This is a serious matter.
每当你在谈论激素
Anytime you're talking about hormones
或控制甲状腺水平
or manipulating levels of thyroid,
你绝对想与你的医生讨论
you absolutely want to talk to your doctor.
有些人可以从补充碘中受益
Some people benefit from supplementing iodine.
它包含在大多数盐中
It is contained in most salts.
并非总是  但经常在喜马拉雅盐中
It's in Himalayan salt, not always, but often.
我知道这些天粉红盐和海盐的风很大
I know these days, there's a lot of excitement
以及什么其他的盐
about pink salts and sea salts and what,
它们是一种工匠制盐的东西
you know, they're kind of artisan salt thing
在美食界刮起了一阵大风  这很棒
has kind of taken off in the foodie land, which is great.
其中一些实际上非常好吃
Some of them are actually quite tasty.
如果你喜欢盐的味道  可以直接服用
You can just take it directly if you like the taste of salt.
但是补充碘
But iodine can be supplemented
可以通过海带  紫菜和海带片
through things like kelp and seaweed and kelp tablets.
那么  如果你患有甲状腺功能亢进症  那么你的甲状腺激素过多
Now, if you are hyperthyroidal, you make too much thyroid,
这就是一个问题了
that actually can be a problem.
所以说真的  弄清楚这一点的最好方法
So really, the best way to figure this out
是为了让你的血液中的甲状腺激素水平得到测试
is to get your blood levels tested of thyroid hormone.
但是海洋里有太多碘
But there's so much iodine in the ocean
信不信由你  住在海岸附近的人
that believe it or not people that live near the coast
实际上可以通过空气吸收它
can actually just absorb it through the air,
只是通过呼吸海洋空气
just by breathing ocean air.
这样就可以让你了解碘的含量
So that gives you a sense of just how little iodine
你实际上需要食用食物或盐
you actually need to consume in food or in salt.
因此  如果你在海洋的几英里范围内
So if you're within a few miles of the ocean
或者你不时地去海边玩
or you visit the ocean from time to time,
你可能会变得富含碘
you're probably getting plenty.
正如我所提到的  它必须与L-酪氨酸
It does have to come together, as I mentioned,
结合在一起
with L-tyrosine,
这就是为什么含有L-酪氨酸的食物
and this is why foods that contain L-tyrosine,
并且只要你的饮食中有足够的碘
and provided that you have sufficient iodine in your diet,
如果你的饮食中有足够的硒
and if you have sufficient selenium in your diet,
确实有助于增加新陈代谢
does serve to increase your metabolism.
这又是为了组织的生长和修复
And that again is for the growth and repair of tissues.
这真的很重要
And that's really important.
不仅仅是保持新陈代谢
It's not just about keeping your metabolism high
这样你就可以更瘦一点
so that you can be on the leaner side of things
或调整体重  对不起
or adjust your body weight, excuse me,
你的体脂比率可以按照你的喜好来
your body composition ratios the way you like.
修复受伤  脑组织修复
Repair of injuries, repair of brain tissue,
清除神经元的任何损伤
clearance of any damage from neurons,
清除身体上的任何损坏
clearance of any damage to the body
也将依赖甲状腺
is also going to depend on thyroid.
同样  新陈代谢就是这种
Again, metabolism being this kind of rate
体内的燃料消耗和使用情况的速度
of fuel consumption and use in the body, generally,
不只是体重指数和类似的东西
not just about body mass indexes and things of that sort.
因此  我们来谈谈硒  因为硒确实很重要
So let's talk about selenium because it's really important.
即使大多数人都吃够了
And even though most people are getting a lot
足够的碘
of sufficient iodine,
而且大多数人可能正在摄取足够的L-酪氨酸
and most people are probably getting enough L-tyrosine.
我猜大多数人可能没有得到足够的硒
I'm guessing most people may not be getting enough selenium
如果他们的目标是增加甲状腺激素
if their goal is to increase thyroid hormone,
至少那是文献中所说的
at least that's what the literature says.
不谈一些生化方面的东西
Without going into the biochemistry,
硒很重要
selenium is important in order
对于制作甲状腺激素
for thyroid hormone to be made
因为它允许L-酪氨酸
because of the way that it allows L-tyrosine
和碘相互作用
and iodine to interact.
问题是大多数人硒摄入不足
And the thing is most people aren't getting enough selenium
因为他们不吃硒含量高的食物
because they don't eat foods that are high in selenium.
那么  你需要多少硒
Now, how much selenium you need
将取决于你生活在哪
will depend on where you live.
实际上  每个国家/地区都不同
It actually varies country by country.
我发现的一些国家
Some countries I found
说你应该得到100微克
say that you should get 100 micrograms,
有人说200  有人说155
some say 200, some say 155.
平均约为155微克
The average was about 155 micrograms,
我看过的国家
the countries I looked at.
试图增加甲状腺水平的人
People who are trying to increase thyroid levels
可能要消耗更多的硒
might want to consume more selenium.
当然  如果你摄取维生素
And if you consume a vitamin, of course,
你想确定它是否含有硒
you want to make sure if it has selenium
你不会因为消耗而过度使用
that you're not overdoing it by consuming
也有很多富含硒的食物
a lot of selenium rich foods either.
但是  尽管如此  我认为这很公平
But nonetheless, I think it's fair to say
大多数人可能会做得很好
that most people probably could do well
通过摄入比目前略多的硒
by ingesting slightly more selenium than they currently are.
虽然  当然  请务必与你的医生讨论
Although, of course, always talk to your doctor.
巴西坚果是重量级冠军
Brazil nuts are the heavyweight champion
从硒中提取的食物
of foods to get selenium from.
它具有很高的硒含量
It has very high concentrations of selenium.
仅用六八颗巴西坚果
In just six or eight Brazil nuts
含有约550微克的硒
contain something like 550 micrograms of selenium.
它也存在于鱼中
It's also present in fish.
所以某些鱼  例如黄鳍金枪鱼
So certain fish like yellowfin tuna,
尽管如今我提起金枪鱼或贝类
although nowadays whenever I mention tuna or shellfish,
这是硒的另一丰富来源
which is the other rich source of selenium,
人们会立即告诉我
people will tell me immediately
农场  养殖地有各种各样的问题
there are all sorts of issues around farm,
有汞等等
not farm, mercury, et cetera.
所以我从来没有特别喜欢吃鱼
So I've never particularly liked eating fish
因为口味的原因
'cause of the way it tastes.
所以这就是为什么我避免它
So that's why I avoid it.
但是对于那些喜欢它的人
But for those of you that like it,
我敢肯定你会更熟练地知晓
I'm sure you're much more skilled
要买哪种鱼  不能买哪种鱼
in knowing which fish to buy and which fish not to buy.
火腿总的来说含有很多硒
Ham, of all things, contains a lot of selenium,
不管出于什么原因
for whatever reason pork does.
我不是常吃猪肉
I'm not a big consumer of pork.
牛肉有一些硒  但是有趣的是
Beef has some selenium, but what's interesting
如果你看一下来源  就知道猪肉  牛肉
if you look at the sources, you know, pork, beef,
火鸡  鸡肉  干酪  鸡蛋  糙米
turkey, chicken, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice,
你要知道的是巴西坚果
what you want to understand is that Brazil nuts,
六到八颗巴西坚果含550微克硒
six to eight Brazil nuts has 550 micrograms of selenium.
还有我提到的所有其他食物
And all the other foods I mentioned
食物体积更大
at much greater portion size
比六到八颗巴西坚果  大得多
than equivalent to six to eight Brazil nuts,
无论是体积还是卡路里
either by volume or by calories,
他们有大约30至50微克的硒
they have something like 30 to 50 micrograms of selenium.
因此  如果你不吃巴西坚果
So if you're not eating Brazil nuts,
我猜大多数人不吃
I'm guessing most people aren't,
而且你没有吃很多动物肉类
and you're not eating a lot of animal based foods,
我知道你们当中很多人不吃动物肉
which I know many of you aren't,
那么你可能没有得到足够的硒
then you're probably not getting enough selenium.
同样  你可以测量这些水平
And again, you can have these levels measured
或者你可以只检查自己正在消耗的东西并弄清楚
or you can just check what you're consuming and figure out
你是否正在满足所需的口粮
whether or not you're meeting the ration that you need
为了获得健康的甲状腺水平
in order to get healthy levels of thyroid.
它存在于蘑菇之类的东西中  但同样
It is present in things like mushrooms, but again,
一碗蘑菇  相当于多少呢
in a bowl of mushrooms, you know, what is the equivalent
一碗蘑菇要含12微克的硒
to a bowl of mushroom is 12 micrograms of selenium.
如果日均摄入量要在100到200之间
And if the daily ration is something in 100 to 200 range,
再次  根据你生活地方的标准来定
again, look it up for the area you are.
你很快就能看到为什么
You can see really quickly why even though things
像蘑菇  菠菜  牛奶和酸奶
like mushrooms and spinach and milk and yogurt
还有小扁豆和腰果
and lentils and cashews,
在我构建的列表中
and now we're into the vegetarian segment
有很多都是素食
of the list that I constructed,
你可能没有得到足够的硒
you're probably not getting enough selenium.
因此  这是一件有趣的事情
So it's kind of an interesting thing.
如果你是一个实验者
If you're an experimenter
你得到医生的许可
and you get the clearance from your doctor,
你可以尝试增加硒水平
you could try increasing your selenium levels
看看这如何影响你的新陈代谢
and see how that impacts your metabolism.
同样  巴西坚果可能将是获得足够的硒水平
Again, Brazil nuts are probably going to be the most direct way
最直接的方法
to get sufficient selenium levels
但是由于巴西坚果的硒含量很高
but because levels are so high in Brazil nuts,
这也意味着你可能不能过度使用它
it also means that you could overdo it as well.
我真的不知道后果是什么
I'm not really aware of what the consequences are
硒过多的后果
of getting too much selenium, although you can get too much
我想  过度使用任何东西  后果都不好
of anything and I'm guessing those consequences aren't good.
我也想提一提  对于孩子们
I also want to mention that for children,
他们每天的硒需求量要低得多
their daily requirements of selenium are much lower,
对于14岁以下的孩子  低至30或40微克
as low as 30 or 40 micrograms for kids 14 years or younger.
在某些方面  我真的很想强调这一点
And in some areas, I really want to underscore this,
每天推荐的硒含量
the amount of selenium that's recommended daily
低至55微克
is as low as 55 micrograms.
所以不是你应该摄入
So it's not that you should be shooting
成千微克的硒甚至数百毫克的硒
for thousands or even high levels of hundreds of micrograms of selenium.
再次  这是微克  而不是毫克
And again, that's micrograms, not milligrams.
再说一遍  看看你需要什么
So again, look into what you need
但是如果你对
but if you're somebody who's interested
在保持甲状腺功能健康和高产的过程感兴趣
in keeping thyroid function healthy and productive,
那你当然要确保
then you certainly want to make sure
你摄取了足够的碘
you're getting enough iodine,
你摄取了足够的硒
you're getting enough selenium
并且你得到足够的L-酪氨酸
and you're getting enough L-tyrosine.
当你开始寻找时  这很有趣
And it's interesting when you start looking
在各种食物  特别是高度加工的食物上
at the various foods, especially highly processed foods,
然后你开始意识到
then you start to realize
也许很多人  也许不是
that perhaps many people, maybe you, are not.
硒并非偶然  还有其他一些作用
Not incidentally, selenium has some other effects
在健康方面可能是非常积极的
on health that can be quite positive.
即使这些与甲状腺无关
And even though these don't relate to thyroid
或特定的生长激素功能
or growth hormone function specifically,
我想你可能想了解他们
I think you might want to know about them,
鉴于我们的主题是硒
given that we're on the topic of selenium.
首先是有三项研究
The first is that there are three studies,
所有这些都显示出非常高的功效
all of which showed very high efficacy
为了减少 先兆子痫的风险
for reducing the risk of something called preeclampsia,
对不起  先兆子痫
excuse me, preeclampsia.
先兆子痫是一种癫痫发作
Preeclampsia is seizures that are related
与在分娩时的
to blood pressure issues during
血压问题有关
or around the delivery of a new baby.
实际上  这是一种罕见的情况
And actually, it's a rare-ish condition
但这实际上可能是致命的
but it actually can be quite deadly.
因此硒很重要
And so the fact that selenium is important
抵消先兆子痫的风险
for offsetting preeclampsia risk is interesting.
我不知道确切的机制
I don't know the exact mechanism
我猜只有少数人
and I'm guessing there are only a few of you out there
已经怀孕或打算怀孕的人
that are either pregnant or thinking of conceiving soon,
但这值得注意
but that's worth noting.
显然  任何与怀孕或哺乳有关的事情
Obviously, anything related to pregnancy or lactation,
都特别要和你的医生谈谈
especially talk to your doctor.
我猜硒可能
I'm guessing that selenium is probably
涵盖在很多产前配方中
in a lot of prenatal formulas
但这是拥有足够硒的明显好处
but that's one clear benefit of having sufficient selenium.
另一个是降低了前列腺癌的风险
The other is a reduced prostate cancer risk.
有研究表明  有足够的硒
There's a study showing that having sufficient selenium
可以降低前列腺癌的风险
can reduce prostate cancer risk.
并且有一些证据
And there is some evidence
如果你食用土壤硒含量低的地区的食物
that if you consume foods from areas with soil
可能会有问题
that's low in selenium, that can be a problem.
上一集  我们谈到了所有与这些土壤质量相关的问题
And last episode, we talked about all these issues related
土壤中的物质会进入食物
to soil quality, things that are making their way into food
会破坏荷尔蒙等
that are disrupting hormones and so forth.
但是食物中有足够的硒
But having sufficient selenium from food
可以抵消任何土壤中的低含量
could offset the low content in any soil.
这样显然可以降低前列腺癌的风险
And so that apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk.
这是次要的影响
It's a minor effect
但这是具有统计意义的
but it's a statistically significant one.
另一个是减少痤疮
And the other one is a reduction in acne,
这很有趣
which is interesting.
我猜想这可能与
I'm guessing that that probably has to do
甲状腺激素通路有关
with the thyroid hormone pathway
因为甲状腺激素可以影响肝脏
because of the way thyroid hormone can impact the liver.
事实证明  肝脏
And it turns out that the liver
和在肝脏中的各种生化反应
and various biochemical reactions
会影响痤疮
in the liver can impact acne.
可能可以单独拿出来做一期播客
And that's probably an episode all into itself
但这只是一些额外的好处
but those are just some additional benefits
获得足够的硒
of getting a sufficient selenium.
好的  我们已经深入到了工具
Okay, so we're already deep into tools
与确保你有足够的硒有关
related to making sure that you have sufficient selenium,
碘和左旋酪氨酸  以使足够
iodine, and L-tyrosine in order to make enough
可以支持你的新陈代谢过程的甲状腺激素
thyroid hormones that can support your metabolic processes
在你的肝脏  你的肌肉  你的肌腱
in your liver, your muscles, your tendons,
无论出于什么目的  保持新陈代谢高
for whatever purpose, keeping your metabolism high,
出于身体成分的原因或为了康复
for body composition reasons or for healing,
使你的大脑保持良好状态
for keeping your brain working well.
我之前提到过  有人
Earlier I mentioned, there are people
遵循非常清洁的饮食习惯
who are following very clean diets.
因此  这些人不食用加工食品
So these are people that consume no processed foods.
他们不吃的任何淀粉
You know, any starch they might eat
米饭或谷物
is going to be maybe a rice or a grain
或他们不食用任何蛋白质
or any protein they might consume
要么来自  要么希望
is going to be either from, let's hope,
来自人道饲养的动物
from humanely raised animal sources
也许它们是纯植物性的
or maybe they're pure plant-based.
那些人信不信由你
Believe it or not, those folks
实际上很容易受到低碘的影响
are actually very susceptible to low iodine
因为事实证明  饮食中如果富含肉类
because it turns out that diets that are very meat rich
而且没有很多蔬菜
and don't have many vegetables,
或者说富含蔬菜的饮食
as well as diets that are very vegetable rich
但没有太多的肉或盐
but don't have many meats or salts
有降低甲状腺激素水平的风险
are at risk of lowering thyroid hormone
通过碘通路和其他通路
by way of the iodine pathway and other pathways.
因此  让我尝试为你简化此过程
And so let me try and simplify this for you.
如果你正在做全肉饮食的话
Chances are if people are doing the all-meat diet,
一点都不放水  也不会拿海藻包裹着牛排吃
they're not sprinkling, they're not wrapping those steaks
他们很可能
in seaweed and they may
缺碘
or may not be supplementing with iodine.
他们可能正在食用碘盐
Chances are they're probably consuming iodine salt
但是他们所需要的量也上升了
but their requirements go up
如果他们不吃蔬菜
if they're not consuming vegetables.
食用蔬菜的人很有意思
People who are consuming vegetables is kind of interesting.
我们总是听到
We always hear
我们应该吃十字花科蔬菜
that we should have our cruciferous vegetables
这些非常重要
and those are so important
但实际上
but there are actually substances,
优质十字花科蔬菜中的有些化合物
compounds within high quality cruciferous vegetables
会干扰甲状腺激素的功能
that can interfere with thyroid hormone function.
因此  如果你正在吃很多这种蔬菜
So if you're eating a lot of that stuff,
很多白菜  然后看看你的其他
a lot of cabbages and just look up your other,
西兰花是一种十字花科蔬菜
I think broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable,
而且我不会报出整个科的名字
and I won't read off the whole list,
你可以上网自己查
you could just put into the internet.
但是我们总是被告知要吃很多
But we're always told to eat a lot
暗绿  多叶的绿色蔬菜
of the dark, leafy green stuff.
好吧  除非那是深色的  绿叶的东西
Well, unless that dark, leafy green stuff
是海带或紫菜
is kelp or seaweed,
但很大概率是  我们没有得到足够的碘
chances are that we're not getting enough iodine
除非我们在食物中加盐
unless we're adding salt to our food.
而且有可能我们会降低
And chances are that we may be lowering
我们正在制造的甲状腺总量
the total amount of thyroid that we're making,
以及在富含植物的饮食中
as well as the fact that in plant-rich diets,
很难得到足够的L-酪氨酸
it's hard to get enough L-tyrosine
而且我不想  我不是在这里指责那些
and I don't want, you know, I'm not here to inflame
素食主义者或食肉动物的任何人
any of the vegans or the carnivore folks.
我在这两个方面都不采取任何立场
I don't take a stance either way on any of that.
我只是在学习  试图报告科学所告诉我们的
I'm just learning, trying to report the science.
我想指出的一点是  你的健康很重要
The point I want to make is your health is important.
因此  如果你纯粹基于植物
So if you are purely plant-based
而且你正在吃很多十字花科蔬菜
and you're eating a lot of cruciferous vegetables,
确保你要摄入足够的碘好吗
make sure you're getting enough iodine.
好像是十字花科蔬菜
It does seem like the cruciferous vegetables
可能会增加对碘的需求
can increase the need for further iodine.
如果你只吃这种全肉饮食  那也是同样的
And same thing if you're purely on this all-meat diet
或你是生酮饮食  你不会摄取很多蔬菜
or your keto, and you're not ingesting many vegetables.
其实我一直以为饮食越干净越好
So I always thought that the cleaner the diet, the better,
但这可能只是
but it turns and probably that's true
从激素调节的角度来看是对的
from the standpoint of, you know, hormone regulation,
比如说调节雌激素和睾丸激素等激素
you know, estrogen and testosterone and other hormones.
高度加工的食物确实很糟糕
The highly processed foods really are terrible.
有很多证据可以证明这一点
There's so much evidence for that.
塑料和加工食品中的邻苯二甲酸盐
The phthalates in plastics and the processed foods
和乳化剂
and the emulsifiers,
我们在上一集中谈到的所有这些东西
all this stuff we talked about previous episode,
但这似乎也是有些人
but it does seem to be that people
不管出于什么原因都没有得到足够的碘的原因
that are not getting enough iodine for whatever reason,
真的需要检查他们的碘水平
really need to check out whether or not their iodine levels
由于事实需要增加
need to be increased because of the fact
他们正在消耗那么多植物或那么多肉
that they're consuming so many plants or so many meats
在某些情况下
and in some cases,
实际上降低甲状腺激素的植物
plants that actually lower thyroid hormone.
我不再白费口舌了
And not to beat a dead horse or cabbage,
但是碘真的可以做很多事情
but there are a number of things that iodine can do
肯定的是
that are positive that are sort of,
它们与甲状腺有关  而不是直接相关
they're related to thyroid, not directly,
他们是甲状腺通路的分支
they're kind of offshoots of the thyroid pathway
在他们的下游  我们会说
on their downstream of it, we would say,
在它们如何影响代谢功能方面
in terms of how they impact metabolic function.
其中之一是减少某些东西
One of those is to reduce something
称为c反应蛋白
called c-reactive protein.
你们中有些人可能听说过CRP或c反应蛋白
Some of you may have heard of CRP or c-reactive protein.
C反应蛋白是你想要让它保持低水平的物质
C-reactive protein is something that you want to keep at modestly low levels.
它与炎症和各种形式有关
It's associated with inflammation and various forms
心脏病  甚至眼疾  黄斑变性
of heart disease and even eye disease, macular degeneration.
所以看来补碘
So it does appear that iodine supplementation
或从食物中获取足够的碘
or getting sufficient iodine from food, either works,
与C反应蛋白水平降低有关
is associated with reduced levels of c-reactive protein
对血液具有抗炎作用
in the blood and an anti-inflammatory effect.
抗炎作用带回我们
And the anti-inflammatory effect brings us back
给我们的老朋友白介素6
to our old friend, interleukin 6.
记住  它们是炎性细胞因子
Remember, they're these inflammatory cytokines.
它们有很多名字
They have many, many names
因为有很多很多
because there are many, many of them.
白细胞介素10是一种抗炎药
Interleukin 10 is the one that's anti-inflammatory.
白细胞介素6是一种具有炎症性的物质
Interleukin 6 is the one that's inflammatory.
每当你看到IL-6时
Anytime you see IL-6,
通常意味着有炎症反应
that usually means that there's an inflammatory response,
有伤口  有大脑发炎
there's a wound, there's inflammation of the brain,
有人要么睡眠不足  要么脑部受伤
somebody is either sleep deprived or had a brain injury
或他们正在处理某种感染
or they're dealing with some sort of infection.
IL-6是炎症的提醒器
IL-6 is kind of a catch-all for inflammation.
而且确实研究表明  补充了碘
And it does appear that iodine supplementation
可以减少与炎症相关的循环IL-6
can reduce circulating IL-6 associated with inflammation.
所以从这个意义上讲
So in that sense,
碘可以具有抗炎作用
iodine can have an anti-inflammatory effect.
因此  到现在为止  它应该已经很清楚了
So by now, it should be abundantly clear.
如果你在乎甲状腺激素
If you care about thyroid hormone,
如果你关心它会影响的通路
if you care about the pathways that it impacts
像是新陈代谢很高
like having a high level of metabolism,
我想如果没有其他原因会很吸引人
which I guess if for no other reason is attractive
因为那样你就可以吃得更多
'cause then you can eat more
并仍然保持健康的身体成分
and still maintain a healthy body composition,
而且还可以改善大脑健康  认知功能
but also for brain health, cognitive function,
组织修复  所有这些东西
tissue repair, all that stuff,
降低c反应蛋白  降低IL-6
keeping c-reactive protein low, keeping IL-6 low,
确保你摄取了足够的碘
make sure you're getting enough iodine,
硒和L-酪氨酸
selenium and L-tyrosine.
如果你好奇甲状腺实际上如何增加新陈代谢
If you're curious how thyroid actually increases
让你多吃等等
the metabolism, allows you to eat more, et cetera.
这与我们上一期介绍的内容有关
It relates to something we covered last issue,
这是葡萄糖
which is glucose.
请记住  当你吃东西时  血糖会上升
Remember when you eat something, blood sugar goes up,
胰岛素是从胰腺分泌的
insulin is secreted from the pancreas
并确保血糖不会过高
and it makes sure that blood glucose doesn't go too high,
可能会损坏组织或太低
which can damage tissues or too low,
这可以使你降血糖
which can make you hypoglycemic.
甲状腺增加葡萄糖摄取
Thyroid increases glucose uptake
通过各种组织  特别是肌肉和骨骼
by various tissues, in particular muscle and bone.
它实际上可以增加骨骼矿物质的密度
It actually can increase bone mineral density,
这真的是一件好事
which is a really good thing.
随着年龄的增长  受伤
As you get older, injuries,
当我说年龄较大时  我的意思是基本上30岁以上
when I say older, I mean basically 30 and older,
你可以更快地从受伤中恢复的原因
the reason you can recover more quickly from injuries
如果你有健康的甲状腺和健康的甲状腺通路
if you have a healthy thyroid and healthy thyroid pathways
是因为你可以消耗能量
is because you can consume energy.
能量被转移到骨骼修复上
That energy is diverted toward bone repair
以及肌肉修复和软骨修复
and muscle repair and cartilage repair.
因此  再次执行此操作的方法是增加ATP
And so the way it does this again is by increasing ATP.
但是这里的全部想法是碘
But the whole idea here is that iodine,
硒  L-酪氨酸  可使甲状腺处于健康水平
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow thyroid to be at healthy levels
这样甲状腺才能吸收血液中的葡萄糖
so that thyroid then can take glucose in the blood
并将其转移到组织中以便使用
and divert it to tissues for it to be used,
特别是你的大脑
in particular your brain.
这就是为什么我们在谈论这些事情
And that's why these things that we're talking about,
补充食物或从中获取食物
supplementing or getting from food,
可以真正改善或支持大脑功能
can actually improve or support brain function.
人们总是问我
People are always asking me,
我应该为我的大脑吃什么食物？
what is the food that I should eat for my brain?
像蓝莓对你的大脑有益吗？
Like, are blueberries good for your brain?
否则他们会问我  核桃对你的大脑有益吗
Or they do ask me, are walnuts good for your brain
因为看起来像大脑
'cause it looks like a brain?
我们之前已经讨论过了
We talked about that earlier.
事实是你需要的
The fact of the matter is what you need
是支持激素的营养素
are nutrients that support hormones
以及支持大脑的生物通路
and biological pathways that support the brain.
这就是考虑的方式
That's the way to think about it.
当人们问到时  我意识到
And I realized when people ask,
我应该吃些什么来支撑我的大脑？
what should I eat to support my brain?
这基本上就是他们要的简短形式
That's basically what they're asking in short form.
因此  保持甲状腺激素健康
So keeping your thyroid hormone healthy
在健康的水平上  那将是非常了不起的
at healthy levels that is, is going to be terrific
对于你的大脑  因为你的新陈代谢的75％
for your brain because 75% of your metabolism
来自你的大脑
is from your brain.
你的大脑使用葡萄糖的能力
The ability of your brain to use glucose
或酮将得到帮助
or ketones for that matter is going to be aided
拥有健康的甲状腺
by having healthy thyroid.
这样做  吃这个  吃那个
So do the things, take the things, eat the things
那将让你
that are going to allow you
保持健康的甲状腺激素水平
to have healthy levels of thyroid hormone.
我敢肯定你们当中有很多人在想
I'm sure a number of you are out there wondering,
我的甲状腺激素水平健康吗？
do I have healthy levels of thyroid hormone?
那些可以从血液中测出
Those can be measured from the blood.
有一些甲状腺机能亢进的迹象
There are some telltale signs of having really high thyroid
或甲状腺真的很低  我可以开始列出这些
or really low thyroid, and I could start listing those off.
他们也很容易在网上找到
They're easy to find online as well.
眼睛鼓胀之类的东西
Things like bulging eyes,
无法保持体重  摇晃  焦虑
inability to maintain weight, shaky, anxiety,
甲亢  头发稀疏
that's kind of hyperthyroidal, thinning of hair,
这种事情
this kind of thing.
我不可能给你们诊断甲状腺功能是否减退
I don't want to get into diagnosing hypothyroidism
或者有甲状腺功能亢进症
and hyperthyroidism.
根本不可能  因为你在屏幕那头
It's just impossible 'cause you're there
我在这里  我们只能看评论 视频
and I'm here and we're kind of shouting back and forth
只是网络一线牵
through a tunnel of video and comments.
如果你担心过高
If you're concerned about having excessively high
或甲状腺激素水平过低
or excessively low levels of thyroid hormone,
绝对查找症状是什么
absolutely look up what the symptoms are.
与你的医师讨论
Talk to your physician.
并且有很多好的治疗方法
And there are a number of good treatments.
我没有谈论处方药
I didn't talk about prescription drugs
可以改善与甲状腺功能减退或甲状腺功能亢进有关的症状
that can improve symptoms related to hypo or hyperthyroid.
当然  他们合成了甲状腺
Of course, they have synthesized thyroid.
所以  如果你没有做足够的甲状腺
So if you don't make enough thyroid,
你可以服用甲状腺  这是根据处方
you can take thyroid, it's by prescription.
如果你甲状腺过多
If you have too much thyroid,
有时他们会取出甲状腺
sometimes they'll take out the thyroid gland
或者他们可以管理药品
or they can administer drugs
会阻塞受体或会干扰
that will either block receptors or will interfere
通过大脑的一些通路
with some of the pathways from the brain
到垂体或从垂体到甲状腺
to the pituitary or from the pituitary to the thyroid
以这种方式调节甲状腺激素
in order to adjust the thyroid hormone that way.
因此  在治疗方面有大手笔
So there are the big guns in terms of the treatments
对于不同的甲状腺疾病
for different thyroid disorders
但是我们不是在谈论甲状腺疾病
but we're not talking about thyroid disorders,
我们正在谈论如何获取和维持甲状腺水平
we're talking about how to get and maintain thyroid levels
在健康范围内以及一些简单的方法来做到这一点
in healthy ranges and some straightforward ways to do that
通过饮食和补充
through diet and supplementation.
也有很多证据
There's also a lot of evidence
对于那些月经来潮的人
that for people who menstruate,
甲状腺激素水平会急剧波动
levels of thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically
在整个月经周期
across the menstrual cycle.
因此  这实际上将是一个实验过程
So that's really going to be a process of experimentation.
我不知道你可以
I don't know that you could,
从理论上讲  你可以在不同阶段采血
you could, in theory, take blood at different phases
你的周期  并找出是否
of your cycle and figure out whether or not
你的甲状腺激素过高或过低
your thyroid hormone was excessively high or low
在周期的不同阶段
at different phases of the cycle.
这将很难做到
That's going to be pretty tough to do.
如果你有内分泌学家
If you have an endocrinologist
愿意与你做到这一点  好极了
that's willing to do that with you, terrific.
我认为大多数人都必须弄清楚
I think most people are going to have to figure out
如何补充各种东西
how supplementing the sorts of things
我们之前讨论过的
that we talked about before,
或从食物中获取它们与
or getting them from foods relates
他们的周期的不同方面
to different aspects of their cycle.
一般来说  排卵前的周期的前半段
In general, the first half of the cycle before ovulation,
人们更渴望碳水化合物和糖果
people crave carbohydrates and sweets more
根据生物学原理  这是完全有意义的
and that makes total sense based on the biology
月经周期
of the menstrual cycle.
甲状腺激素会随着你而上升
Thyroid hormone is going to go up as you,
不论男女  无论月经与否
as anyone, male or female, menstruating or not,
增加更多的淀粉状碳水化合物
increases more starchy carbohydrates.
这很有趣  因为已经显示出生酮饮食
This is interesting because ketogenic diets have been shown
降低甲状腺水平
to slightly lower thyroid levels.
这是有道理的  因为在生酮饮食中
And that makes sense because in ketogenic diets,
血糖水平很低
blood glucose levels are very low.
甲状腺激素大量分泌
And thyroid hormone is secreted in large part
与血液中葡萄糖的含量成正比
in proportion to how much glucose is in the bloodstream
请问需要调节多少葡萄糖
and how much that glucose, excuse me, needs to be regulated.
因此  我并不是要妖魔化生酮饮食
So I'm not trying to demonize the ketogenic diet.
我认为它肯定有它的位置
I think it definitely has its place.
现在有22个研究
There are 22 studies now
表明它可以显着降低血糖
showing that it can dramatically reduce blood glucose.
其中约有三分之一表明甲状腺激素水平
And about a third of those show that thyroid hormone levels
略有减少  有时会大大减少
are slightly reduced, sometimes significantly,
如果不是更多  则在生酮饮食中
if not more, in the ketogenic diet
可能会解释  我想强调可能会解释
that may explain, I want to highlight may explain
人们回到传统饮食的事实
the fact that when people go back to a more traditional diet
如果他们长期服用生酮饮食
if they've been on a ketogenic diet for a long time,
通常他们会很快增重
that oftentimes they will gain weight very quickly
因为它们将碳水化合物带回饮食中
as they bring carbohydrates back into their diet.
有些人在用循环饮食
Some people are cycling
每三  四天在生酮和非生酮之间发生一次
between ketogenic and non-ketogenic every three, four days.
所谓的周期性生酮饮食
So-called cyclical ketogenic diet.
有些人会长时间生酮
Some people are staying ketogenic for long periods of time.
有些人一天休息六天
Some people six days on, one day off.
所以那里有很大的变化
So there's a huge variation there.
关键是碳水化合物
The point is that carbohydrates,
特别是淀粉状碳水化合物
starchy carbohydrates in particular,
支持T3和T4的健康生产
support the healthy production of T3 and T4.
因此  如果你的碳水化合物含量很低
And so if you're very low carbohydrate,
你将减少T3和T4
you're going to have a reduction in T3 and T4.
因此  如果你要携带碳水化合物
And so if you're going to bring carbohydrates
回到你的饮食中
back into your diet,
那么你可能需要逐步进行
then you might want to do it more gradually.
对于你们那些月经来潮的人
And for those of you that menstruate,
并且渴望碳水化合物
and are craving carbohydrates
在周期的早期
in the early part of the cycle,
这实际上与健康的周期有关
that is actually associated with having a healthy cycle.
如果你中的任何一个生酮饮食的周期很健康
If any of you have had a healthy cycle on a ketogenic diet,
那会很有趣
that would be interesting.
也许让我通过评论知道
Maybe let me know through the comments
或指出我的研究方向
or point me in the direction of some research
如果你知道的话
if you're aware of it.
因此  你可以开始看到
So as you can start to see,
在不同的激素之间
there's this really beautiful interplay
有一个非常美妙的互动
between the different hormones,
在胰岛素和葡萄糖之间  在雌激素和甲状腺之间
between insulin and glucose, between estrogen and thyroid,
甲状腺和血糖与生酮饮食之间的关系
between thyroid and blood glucose and the ketogenic diet.
一切开始融合在一起
It all starts to fit together
以很有意义的方式
in ways that make a lot of sense
一旦你了解了其中的核心要素
once you understand just kind of the core elements
什么是荷尔蒙
of what the hormones are
以及他们工作的各种组织
and the variety of tissues that they work on.
这个简单的版本
The simple version of this
如果你已经一年没有碳水化合物了
is if you haven't had a carbohydrate for a year,
那么你的T3  T4水平将非常低
then your T3, T4 levels are going to be pretty low.
而且我敢肯定那里有一些ketonistas
And I'm sure there's some ketonistas out there.
他们会说  等等  不
They're going to say, wait, no,
甲状腺激素水平与酮一起上升
thyroid hormone levels go up with keto.
出于其他原因  这可能是正确的
That might be true for other reasons,
与激素通路有关的间接原因
indirect reasons related to hormone pathways
因患酮症而级联
that are cascade from being in ketosis
很长一段时间
for long periods of time.
很好
Great.
但是对于大多数不消耗碳水化合物的人来说
But for most people that don't consume any carbohydrate,
T3  T4将会下降
T3, T4 are going to go down.
当他们开始食用食物时
And when they start to consume foods
需要甲状腺代谢
that require thyroid metabolism
为了与之代谢
in order to work with, to metabolize,
那么有时体重增加会更快
then weight gain can sometimes happen more quickly.
因此  这只是要考虑的事情
So it's just something to consider.
这是需要谨慎处理的事情
And it's something to work with carefully
如果你将要循环生酮  长期生酮
if you're going to be cyclic ketogenic, long-term ketogenic.
如果你不是生酮的
And if you're not ketogenic,
并且你消耗碳水化合物
and you're consuming carbohydrates.
还有我们之前谈到的三件事
And the three things that we talked about earlier,
硒  酪氨酸和碘
selenium, tyrosine and iodine,
除非那里有潜在的条件  否则机会是
chances are unless there's an underlying condition there
你的甲状腺水平将是
that your levels of thyroid are going to be
在健康范围内的
in healthy range.
接下来  我们将讨论生长激素
Next, we're going to talk about growth hormone.
生长激素备受关注
Growth hormone has received a ton of attention
在过去的20年中
in the last 20 years.
我实际上还记得整个时间线
I actually remember when it was for sequenced.
这是一笔大买卖
This was a huge deal.
有一段巨大的专​​利戏
There was a huge patent drama.
我不会提及参与人员的大学
I won't mention the universities of the people involved.
有公司  各种奇奇怪怪的专利和支出
There were companies and monster patents and payouts
这真的很有趣
and it was really interesting.
你可以上网查一下
You can look that up online
如果你对某些科学历史感兴趣
if you're interested in some of the scientific history.
生长激素是非常简单的一种
Growth hormone is a pretty straightforward one
因为它遵循
for you to understand now because it follows
与甲状腺激素完全相同的逻辑
the exact same logic as thyroid hormone.
实际上  它们的功能是如此紧密地重叠
In fact, their functions are so closely overlapping
当我们第一次看它的整体逻辑时
on the, you know, when we first look at the face of it
你可能会想
that you're probably going to think,
为什么会有这两个系统？明明当成一个来看就行了
why do you have these two systems?
因此  非常简短地说  就是生长激素释放激素
So just very briefly, growth hormone-releasing hormone.
所以请记住释放是指它来自大脑
So remember releasing means it comes from the brain,
来自大脑并告诉垂体
comes from the brain and tells the pituitary
你要释放生长激素了
to release growth hormone,
然后释放生长激素
and then growth hormone is released
进入血液
into the bloodstream where it goes and acts
在大量的组织  肌肉  韧带上起作用
on a ton of tissues, muscle, ligaments,
骨骼  脂肪等  以增加新陈代谢
bone, fat, et cetera, to increase metabolism.
听起来就像甲状腺激素
It sounds just like thyroid hormone.
而且它们确实并行工作
And they do work in parallel.
这就是为什么我们将它们集中在一起
And that's why we've lumped them together
在同一集中讲
in the same episode.
它们增加新陈代谢和修复
They increase metabolism and repair
和组织的生长
and growth of tissues.
关于生长激素的对话将是不完整的
A conversation about growth hormone would be incomplete
如果我们不谈论那种极端的情况
if we didn't talk about the kind of extremes.
有些人是天生的
There are certain people who are born
不能产生足够的生长激素
that don't make enough growth hormone,
他们的身材很矮
and they end up very short in stature.
有些人会制造大量的生长激素
There are certain people who make a ton of growth hormone
他们最终变得非常非常大
and they end up very, very large.
他们往往有很大的四肢
They tend to have very large appendages.
他们患有肢端肥大症
They have something called acromegaly.
有点像额头上的皱纹
It's kind of like a ridging of the forehead.
它实际上是一个骨
It's actually a bone ridge.
他们是巨人
They are giant.
它曾经被称为巨人症
And it used to be called giantism.
当然  大多数人的身高都在一定范围内
And most people of course are in a range of height
和四肢的长度
and appendage length.
那并不意味着
That doesn't imply
那里有生长激素破坏
that there's a growth hormone disruption there.
生长激素在消费着市场上备受关注
Growth hormone received a lot of attention
因为这意味着有很多产业
after it was sequenced because that meant the opportunity
可以让人注入生长激素
to inject growth hormone
并更换丢失的生长激素
and replace growth hormone that was lost.
实际上有很多情况
And there was actually a lot of cases
想让孩子变得更高的人
of people taking their kids and trying to get them
无论出于什么原因
to be taller for whatever reason
他们会通过注射生长激素
by injecting growth hormone.
今天  我们要谈论的事情
Today, we're going to talk about the things
任何人都可以做的  来增加生长激素
that anyone can do to increase growth hormone.
而且某些人就是有一定的原因
And there are reasons why certain people
想要做到这一点
would want to do that.
过度分泌生长激素的人
People who overproduce growth hormone
当然不愿意这样做
certainly would not want to do that.
产量不足的人可能想这样做
People who underproduce it would probably want to do that.
来获得“正常”的生长激素水平
People that make normal, quote, unquote,
可能想要做到这一点
levels of growth hormone might want to do that
随着年龄的增长  因为在青春期和发育过程中
as they age because during puberty and development,
垂体会分泌大量的生长激素
the pituitary is churning out tons of growth hormone.
它负责身高生长  以及身体及其所有特征的生长
It's responsible for the growth, not surprising,
不足为奇
of the body and all its features.
身高  只是其中之一
Height, just being one of those.
因此  随着年龄的增长  我们会减少生长激素的含量
And so as we age, we make less growth hormone.
这就是我们受伤康复比较慢的原因之一
And that is one of the reasons why we recover more slowly from injuries.
这是我们堆积体内脂肪的原因之一
It's one of the reasons why we accumulate body fat.
这也是我们的新陈代谢减慢的原因之一
And it's one of the reasons why our metabolism slows.
生长激素替代疗法
And so growth hormone replacement therapy
在过去的20年中非常受欢迎
has been tremendously popular in the last 20 years,
这并不是说它不会带来问题  它会有相应的问题狐仙
which is not to say it doesn't carry its problems, it does.
注射生长激素
Here's one of the major problems
主要问题之一就是
with injecting growth hormone.
并不是说人们不应该这样做
Not saying people shouldn't do this
如果医生批准或保留
if the doctor has approved it or it's in keeping
有他们特定的人生目标
with their particular life goals,
但是生长激素  如果水平太高
but growth hormone, if it's in levels that are too high,
会引起所有组织的生长
will cause growth of all tissues.
因此  不仅是肌肉  不仅仅是
So not just muscle, not just reduction
通过体内脂肪的代谢减少
in body fat by metabolizing, you know,
通过允许脂肪酸被淘汰出库
by allowing fatty acids to be pulled out of storage
并用于ATP  但这也会引起
and used for ATP, but it will also cause increase
在心脏和肺部的生长
in growth of the heart and the lungs
以及肝脏和脾脏
and the liver and the spleen.
因此  这是生长激素滥用的问题
And so this is the concern with abuse of growth hormone.
所以我们不会说一些
So we're not going to be talking
关于滥用生长激素的话题
about abuse of growth hormone.
但是  我们将讨论任何人都可以使用的工具
We will, however, talk about tools that anyone can use
增加生长激素的水平
to increase levels of growth hormone.
其中有些是行为举止
Some of them are behavioral,
其中一些是基于补充的
some of them are supplement-based
其中一些与行为和补品互动
and some of them interact with behaviors and supplements.
讨论中最酷的
And what's cool about the discussion
关于生长激素的工具的是
about growth hormone is that the tools
用来增加生长激素的
that exist out there to increase growth hormone
非常可行的方法
are very actionable.
大多数人都能做到
Most people can do these without the need
不需要任何设备甚至任何补充剂
for any equipment or even any supplement.
尽管有一些与补充有关的主题
Although there are some supplement related themes
可以用于增加生长激素的工具
for tools for growth hormone increase.
还有一个人可以得到的增加
And also the increases that one can get
生长激素的含量很高
in growth hormone are substantial.
所以通常  当你谈论差异时
So normally, when you talk about the difference
之间的东西作为外在物质
between taking something as an exogenous substance
如睾丸激素或雌激素与使用补充剂
like testosterone or estrogen versus using supplements
或增加他们的行为
or behaviors to increase them,
你说的是十倍的差异
you're talking about tenfold differences from, you know,
管理处方化合物
administering the prescription compound.
就生长激素而言
In terms of growth hormone,
有些东西可以增加生长激素3
there are things that can increase growth hormone three,
4、  500％或更多
four, 500% or more.
即使那是短暂的增长
And even though that's a short-lived increase,
他们可以产生非常强大的效果
they can have very powerful effects
在新陈代谢和组织修复上
on metabolism and on repair of tissues.
因此  让我们谈谈这些
So let's talk about those.
好吧  让我们一步一步来
Okay, let's go step by step in terms of the things
任何人  也许每个人
that anyone, perhaps everyone,
为了维护
should be doing in order to maintain
健康生长激素水平而应该做的
healthy growth hormone levels
或生长激素水平升高
or increased growth hormone levels.
除非你有过量的生长激素
Unless you have overproduction of growth hormone,
这些事情很有可能使你受益
chances are these things are going to benefit to you.
但是  我想一如既往地强调
However, as always, I want to emphasize,
在你做任何事情之前先咨询医生
talk to a doctor before you do anything,
包括删除任何治疗方法
including remove any treatments.
所以你要添加或删除的任何内容
So anything you would add or take away,
那是你和你的医疗服务提供者
that's the responsibility of you
的责任  好吧
and your healthcare provider, okay?
这么说不只是为了保护我
I don't just say that to protect me,
这么说是为了保护你
I say that to protect you.
首先  生长激素
First of all, growth hormone is released
在每天晚上睡觉的时候被释放
every night when you go to sleep
它在睡眠的早期被释放
and it's released in the early part of sleep,
在所谓的慢波睡眠中
during so-called slow-wave sleep.
所以必须要满足的两个条件
So the two conditions that have to be met
为了定期分泌生长激素
in order for growth hormone to be secreted regularly
用于组织修复等
for tissue repair, et cetera,
你需要进入慢波睡眠  所谓的深度睡眠
are you need to get into slow-wave sleep
有两个条件  你需要血液胰岛素
that so-called deep sleep and you need blood insulin
和葡萄糖相对较低
and glucose to be relatively low.
所以不要睡眠前两个小时内进食
So eating within two hours of sleep,
不要睡眠前两个小时内进食
excuse me, eating within two hours of going to sleep
不然将抑制生长激素的释放
is going to suppress growth hormone release.
很清楚
That's very clear.
但是  有些人会遇到问题
However, some people are going to have problems
如果他们太饿了会睡不着
falling asleep if they are too hungry.
所以你必须要努力
So you have to work with that
并决定要吃什么
and decide what you're going to eat.
你是要吃那东西
And when you're going to eat that thing
这样你就不会那么饿了
so that you're not so hungry
然后再入睡
that you're having trouble falling asleep.
涵盖的睡眠的内容
The episodes on sleep that were covered
在Huberman Lab播客的第二  三和四集中
in episodes two, three, and four of the Huberman Lab Podcast
我相信那里拥有的工具比你想要的要多
has, I believe, more tools there than you could ever want
如何优化睡眠 等等
or make use of in terms of how to optimize sleep.
因此  你可以根据需要参考这些内容
So you can refer to those, if you like.
所以不要再临近睡觉的时候吃东西
So don't eat too close to sleep
然后进入慢波睡眠
and then get into slow-wave sleep.
正如我在较早的几集中所谈到的那样
And as I talked about in one of those earlier episodes,
上半夜
the first half of the night,
慢波睡眠和深度睡眠占主导
slow-wave sleep and deep sleep predominate.
下半夜
The second half of the night,
这是另一种睡眠  我们称之为REM睡眠
it's another kind of sleep, we call it REM sleep.
那么  这种早期睡眠有什么特别之处呢？
So what is special about this early phase of sleep?
你应该这么想
This is how you should be thinking
如果你收听此播客
if you listen to this podcast.
你应该在想  好吧
You should be thinking, okay,
我听说有些重要的事情
I hear that something is important,
它是相关的  它在通路中
it's related, it's in the pathway,
但是从机制角度说  当我们进入慢波睡眠时
but mechanistically when we say get into slow-wave sleep,
也就是进入深度睡眠
get into deep sleep,
那就是生长激素被分泌出来的时候
that's when growth hormone is secreted.
这时候  你应该问自己
The question you should be asking yourselves
作为你自己身体的科学家   为什么要慢波入睡呢？
as scientists of yourselves is wait, why slow-wave sleep?
特别是慢波深度睡眠
What in particular about slow-wave deep sleep
才能允许垂体释放生长激素？
allows the pituitary to release growth hormone?
到底为什么？
Like, what is it?
因为如果你能理解
Because if you can understand that,
如果你能了解一些机制
if you can understand a little bit of mechanism,
实际上  你可以自己增加一些方法
there are actually ways that you can increase
去释放的生长激素的量
the amount of growth hormone that you release
无论是在睡眠中还是睡眠外
both in sleep and out of sleep.
因此  答案是  大脑中的三角波活动
So the answer is it's delta wave activity in the brain.
三角波活动是这些巨大的活动浪潮
Delta waves are these big giant waves of activity
与慢波睡眠相关的大脑中
in the brain that correlate with slow-wave sleep
与更快的活动浪潮相反
as opposed to faster waves of activity
与快速眼动睡眠有关
that is associated with rapid eye movement sleep.
所以慢波睡眠和三角波活动
So slow-wave sleep and the delta activity
实际上触发了大脑中的神经元
actually triggers the neurons in the brain,
释放激素
the releasing hormone, right?
生长激素释放激素神经元
Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons
向垂体发信号
to signal to the pituitary.
那么  我怎么知道这是真的？
Now, how do I know this is true?
那你该怎么办？
And what can you do with this?
好吧  我们知道这是真的
Well, we know this is true
因为研究人员带走了人们
because researchers have taken people
睡眠剥夺了他们  他们只是问
and sleep deprived them, and they just asked, well,
每24小时只有一个时间段吗
is it just one period of time every 24 hours
然后垂体释放生长激素
and then the pituitary releases growth hormone?
如果是这样  那会说
If that were the case, that would say
生长激素刚刚被释放
that growth hormone is just released
以所谓的昼夜节律依赖的方式
in a so-called circadian dependent way.
每24小时就是一次脉搏  但没有
Every 24 hours is the pulse of it, but no,
它总是和慢波有关
it's always relating to slow-wave
深度睡眠和三角波
deep sleep and delta waves.
这很酷  因为这意味着什么
And this is cool because what it means
即使你没有测量脑波
is that even if you're not measuring your brainwaves
在睡眠中  你们大多数人可能不是
during sleep, which most of you probably are not,
你可能正在测量
you might be measuring slow-wave sleep
使用Whoop或Oura等设备测量慢波睡眠 深度睡眠
or deep sleep using a device like a Whoop or Oura.
即使你不是
And even if you're not,
这意味着在白天
what this means is that during the day,
也有可能
there's the potential
也可以增加生长激素的释放
to also increase growth hormone release
如果你可以使大脑陷入所谓的三角波
if you can get the brain into the so-called delta waves.
事实证明  你可以做一些事情
And it turns out there are things you can do
在醒着的同时也增加生长激素的释放
in waking as well to increase growth hormone release.
因此  我们接下来将讨论这些内容
So we're going to talk about those next.
但是作为一种工具  只是要确保
But as a tool and to just really make sure
我们用括号括起来
that we put brackets around this,
尝试使血糖不要太高
try and have blood glucose not too high.
因此  如果你确实需要在床边吃饭
So if you do need to eat close to bed,
你不想吃任何东西
you wouldn't want to eat anything
那会增加血糖过多
that would increase blood glucose too much.
尽量不要在就寝时间吃得太近
Try not to eat too close to bedtime.
深夜入睡
Get into deep sleep early in the night.
获取生长激素释放
Get the growth hormone release.
并了解这是活动的三角波
And understand that it's the delta waves of activity,
神经元活动波涛汹涌
the sweeping big waves of activity in the neurons
刺激大脑刺激垂体
that stimulate the brain to stimulate the pituitary.
因为一旦你明白了
Because once you understand that,
那么你有东西要锚定
then you have something to anchor to
在思考我能做些什么
in terms of thinking what are the things I can do
在醒来时  这将使我释放更多的生长激素
in waking that will allow me to release more growth hormone
对于大多数人来说  这将是一件好事
which for most people is going to be a good thing.
在此播客上
Several times before on this podcast,
我说过我不是一个褪黑素的忠实粉丝
I've talked about the fact that I'm not a big fan
用于大多数目的的褪黑激素补充剂
of melatonin supplementation for most purposes.
在时差的条件下可能会有所帮助
It might be helpful under conditions of jet lag.
但是  有很多原因
However, there are a lot of reasons
为什么我个人不喜欢褪黑激素
why I personally don't like melatonin.
它与生殖激素相互作用
It interacts with the reproductive hormones,
睾丸激素和雌激素
testosterone and estrogen,
而且整个刺激的方式都没有吸引力
and that whole access in ways that are unattractive,
至少对我来说
at least to me.
它抑制发育中的青春期
It suppresses puberty during development.
在大多数补品中  它的剂量要高得多
It's present in much, much higher doses in most supplements
比通常的一百倍  三百倍要高
than one would normally make like a hundred fold, 300 fold.
但是  今天我要谈一个实例
However, today I'm going to talk about an instance
褪黑激素补充水平很低的地方
where very low levels of melatonin supplementation
可能实际上是有利的
might actually be advantageous.
这有助于过渡
And that is aiding the transition
我刚刚描述的三角波  慢波睡眠
to the delta wave, slow-wave sleep I just described
因为那是睡眠的方式
because that's the pattern of sleep
和触发生长激素释放的脑电波活动
and brainwave activity that triggers growth hormone release.
因此  尽管大多数褪黑激素补充剂是1毫克
So whereas most melatonin supplements are one milligram,
三毫克  十二毫克
three milligrams, 12 milligrams, this kind of thing,
那是超过生理需求的剂量
that is super physiological.
有一些数据显示微克
There are some data showing that microgram,
也许是500微克的褪黑素  所以是半毫克
maybe 500 micrograms of melatonin, so half a milligram,
可以改变睡眠模式
can be beneficial in shifting the pattern
让晚上的睡眠更多地朝慢波方向发展
of early night's sleep toward more of the slow-wave
深度睡眠三角洲活动
deep sleep delta activity
并改善生长激素的释放
and improving growth hormone release.
研究不是很多  但我看到的是高质量研究
Not a lot of studies but the ones that I saw are quality.
它们是在很大的群体中实验得出的
They were done in subjects that, you know,
不同的性别  足够的人数等等
both sexes, sufficient numbers, et cetera.
所以这很有趣
So this is interesting.
因此  如果你对补充褪黑激素感兴趣
So if you're interested in melatonin supplementation,
你可能会在非常低的水平上考虑服用它
you might think about it just at very low levels.
几百微克
You know, hundreds of micrograms
而不是多少毫克的剂量
as opposed to the milligram dosages.
大多数人
Most of the ones out there
都以毫克为剂量单位
are going to be in milligram dosages.
所以这是一些研究表明的一种方式
So that's one way that some studies have shown
你可以增加生长激素的量
that you can increase the amount of growth hormone
那是在睡眠的早期阶段所分泌的
that's secreted in early phases of sleep.
那么  三角波活动和慢波活动
Now, the delta wave activity and the slow-wave activity
在大脑中非常重要
in the brain being very important
用于生长激素释放和生长激素释放
for growth hormone release and growth hormone release
对代谢功能如此重要
being so important for metabolic functions
剥去多余的身体脂肪
and peeling away unwanted body fat
和修复组织等等
and repairing tissues, et cetera,
迫使我们问  我们还能做些什么
forces us to ask, well, what other things can we do
在醒来以增加生长激素的释放？
in waking in order to increase growth hormone release?
所以我们开始吧
So let's start
与那些可能产生重大影响的
with the ones that have a potentially big effect
但访问起来有点困难
but are a little bit harder to access.
为此  我想推荐一本书
And for that, I want to point toward a book,
这真的很有趣
which is really kind of interesting.
它不专注于讲生长激素
It's not focused on growth hormone
但是这本书叫《改变的特质》
but the book is called "Altered Traits."
这是本书
This is the book.
这是一本很棒的书
It's an excellent book,
戈尔曼和戴维森的《改变的特质》
"Altered Traits" by Goleman and Davidson.
“科学揭示了冥想的方式
"Science Reveals How Meditation
改变你的思想  大脑和身体”
Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body."
非常有趣的书
Very interesting book.
对于你们中那些对冥想感兴趣的人
For those of you that are interested in meditation,
也许你们当中对冥想不感兴趣
and perhaps those of you who are not,
但是正在考虑要不要进行冥想
but are considering it,
他们在这本书中谈论说
what they talk about in this book is the fact
冥想有两条不同的效果线
that meditation has two separate lines of effects.
两条线之一是
One of those lines of effects are things
改变你的状态的效果
that change your state.
比如说  你很紧张
So you're stressed.
你坐下  冥想
You sit down, you meditate
然后你就会放松  并进入一种特定的状态
and you relax and you go into a particular state.
另一个是随着时间的推移发生的变化
The other are the changes that occur over time
这些就是特质的改变
and those are changes in trait.
所以性格实际上可以改变
So personality can actually change
通过长时间进行TM冥想或反复冥想
with long bouts of TM meditation or repeated meditation.
无论如何  我们谈论
In any case, the reason we're talking
《改变的特征》的原因  是因为
about "Altered Traits" today is because certain types
某些类型的冥想可以吸引人的大脑
of meditation can get people's brains
进入非常类似于慢波睡眠的状态
into states that very closely mimic slow-wave sleep.
如果你在后台听到打呼的声音  那么是Costello
If you hear snoring in the background, Costello is,
听起来好像他正在慢波睡眠中
sounds like he's in slow-wave sleep.
这些巨大的打呼声
These big oscillatory snores
他每天睡眠23.6个小时
that he's in 23.6 hours per day.
所以这对有兴趣的人来说意味着
So what this means is for people that are interested
在增加生长激素  冥想练习
in increasing growth hormone, a meditation practice
可以让你进入这些慢波三角波类型
that allows you to get into these slow-wave delta type
大脑中的频率活动可能非常有益
frequency activity in the brain may be very beneficial
因为就像我之前提到的
because as I mentioned before,
这就是控制生长激素释放的原因
that's what's gating growth hormone release.
这不仅是昼夜节律现象
It's not just a circadian phenomenon,
它实际上是由这些脑电波控制的
it's actually controlled by these brainwaves.
我确实查过双耳节拍
I did look up binaural beats.
我对双耳节拍有很多疑问
I get so many questions about binaural beats
这是一个非常吸引人的主意  是吧
and it's a really attractive idea, right?
如果你本来不知道什么是双耳节拍
Binaural beats, for those of you don't know,
就是你一只耳朵听一种频率的声音
you listen to one frequency of tone in one ear
而另一种频率的音调在另一只耳朵
and another frequency of tone and the other ear,
然后大脑实质上取两者的平均值
and then the brain essentially takes the average of the two
或脑干中还有其他连线
or there's some other wiring in the brainstem
这使得它不是很平均
that makes it not quite the average
但是为了讨论起见  它采用了两者的平均值
but it takes the average of the two for sake of discussion.
而这种频率正是大脑所夹带的
And that frequency is what the brain entrains
或实际映射到的
or maps onto.
有很多应用声称
There are a lot of apps that are claiming
可以使用双耳节拍
that you can get the brain into delta waves
使大脑陷入三角波
using binaural beats.
我找不到高质量的同行评审研究
I could not find quality peer review studies
来支持这一点  但我知道有很多人
supporting that, but I know there are a lot of fans
喜欢用双耳节拍
out there of binaural beats.
如果你知道任何文献
If you know of any literature
独立于公司
that's independent of the company
产生了双耳节拍技术
that makes the binaural beat technology,
如此公正的研究  请发送给我
so unbiased research, please send it my way.
但是在《改变的特质》中  戈尔曼和戴维森
But in "Altered Traits," Goleman and Davidson
说说每天做20分钟冥想的人
talk about the fact that people who do 20 minutes of sitting meditation per day
可以像大脑状态一样进入这些慢波睡眠状态
can access these slow-wave sleep like brain states.
那么  我在这里聊了很多
Now, I've talked a lot on here
关于非睡眠深度休息
about non-sleep deep rest,
瑜伽nidra和催眠之类的东西
things like yoga nidra and hypnosis.
我不知道那些会把人
I'm not aware that those will put people
带到慢波睡眠  或者本身就是三角波睡眠
into slow-wave sleep per se, or delta waves per se.
所以我们实际上是在谈论20分钟
So we're really talking about 20 minutes
更传统的类型冥想
of more traditional type meditation.
好吧  所以我们谈论了非常低剂量的褪黑激素
Okay, so we've talked about very low doses of melatonin
作为触发三角波的一种方式
as a way to trigger delta waves
并在睡眠中释放更多的生长激素
and more growth hormone release in sleep.
有科学支持这一点
There's science to support that.
那么  我们讨论了20分钟的唤醒行为
We've now talked about a waking behavior of 20 minutes
我称之为标准冥想的那种
of sort of what I would call standard meditation
或只是坐在那里  专注于呼吸
or just sitting there, concentrating on one's breathing
尝试进入三角波
to try and access delta waves.
双耳节拍  尚无科学证明
Binaural beats, no science yet.
不过我也不知道
Who knows?
也许有科学支持它
Maybe there's science to support it.
如果有   请告诉我
If you're aware of it, let me know.
那么  让我们转到一个人可以做的事情
Now, let's move to the things that one can do
被证明具有什么意义  说实话
that have been shown to have what's, let's just be honest,
在醒着时对生长激素释放的影响很大
pretty enormous effects on growth hormone release in waking.
这些都是非常可行的事情
And these are things that are very actionable.
可能会产生巨大影响的事情之一
One of the things that can have a dramatic effect
清醒时生长激素释放的水平
on levels of growth hormone release in waking
以及第二天晚上入睡
as well as in sleep the following night is exercise.
但是关键是运动的类型和持续时间
But the key is the type of exercise and the duration.
那么  有一个逻辑
Now, there's a logic to this.
有数百个（如果不是数千个）研究
There are hundreds, if not thousands of studies
测量生长激素
measuring growth hormone,
在运动中或运动后
both during or sometimes after exercise
或第二天晚上
or the following night.
从所有之中结论出来的
And the conclusion that one takes away
就是这些锻炼
from all of these is that exercise
必须具有特定的持续时间和强度
has to be of particular duration and intensity
才能获得生长激素的释放
in order to get growth hormone release.
所以首先我要告诉你
So first I'm just going to tell you
我发现是
what I found to be the maximum amount
生长激素最大程度的释放
of growth hormone release
与特定形式的锻炼有关
as it relates to a particular form of exercise.
锻炼的特定形式是重量训练
The particular form of exercise is either weight training
也可以是耐力训练
or it can be endurance training,
但是耐力训练和重量训练
but the endurance training and the weight training
实际上必须限制在60分钟左右
actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes,
不能更多了
not much longer.
那么  这很重要
Now, this is important
因为它被一遍又一遍地显示
because it's been shown over and over again
如果一个人进行过长时间的负重运动
that if one exercises too long with weights
或耐力运动  使皮质醇水平足够高
or endurance exercise, that cortisol levels go high enough
会开始抑制睾丸激素
that it starts to inhibit the testosterone
甚至雌激素通路
and even the estrogen pathways.
这就是为什么我相信过度运动的人
This is why I believe people who overexercise
或大量运动可能会丢掉月经
or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles.
她们停止月经
They stop menstruating.
这就是为什么你会抑制睾丸激素
It's why you get suppressions in testosterone
如果人们训练时间太长  太努力
if people train too long and too hard.
太长意味着
The cutoff has always been, you know,
60至75分钟的努力训练
60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.
不同的人会有很大的不同
It's going to vary a lot from person to person,
但是就生长激素而言
but in terms of growth hormone,
似乎导致的情况
the conditions that seem to lead
以最大的生长激素释放量是一种  要保暖  热身
to the greatest growth hormone releases are one, get warm.
这很有趣  我们将讨论温度
This is interesting, we're going to talk about temperature.
因此适当的预热似乎会加速
So a proper warmup seems to accelerate
生长激素的释放
the release of growth hormone
一旦艰苦的工作阶段开始
once the hard work phase starts.
因此  预备热身10分钟左右
So 10 minutes of warmup or so was the number
我从所有这些研究中提取出来的
that I extracted from all these studies.
顺便说一下  对此有一个很好的评论
There's a beautiful review on this, by the way.
生长激素的反应各不相同
Growth hormone responses of varying, excuse me,
“生长激素  精氨酸和运动”
"Growth hormone, arginine and exercise."
几分钟后  我们将讨论精氨酸
We'll talk about arginine in a few minutes.
那是KANALEY  KANALEY的作品
That's by Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-E-Y.
它发表在《当前意见》上
It was published in Current Opinion
在“临床营养和代谢护理领域”
in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care.
一般而言  “当前意见”期刊是
The Current Opinion journals are generally
在期刊领域有着相当高的质量
of pretty high quality in terms of the reviews
只是因为它们往往是最近的研究
just because they tend to be pretty recent.
然后其中的参考文献也相当不错
And then the references therein are also quite good.
那么这是什么意思？
So what does this mean?
这意味着要热身
This means warm up.
当你说热身时
And when you say warm up,
这并不意味着只是热身你将要使用的四肢和组织
it doesn't mean just warm up the limbs and tissues
以免受伤
that you're going to use so you don't get injured,
实际上要温暖整个身体
actually warm the body.
所以实际上有一些讨论
So there was actually some discussion
关于是否在寒冷的冬季
about whether or not in cold winter months,
人们应该戴长袜帽
people should wear like a stocking cap,
或者说进入一个温暖的房间
bringing the conditions, making the room warm.
因此  让身体变暖似乎很重要
So getting the body warm as a warmup seems to be important
因为身体的温度
because temperature of the body
似乎是一个重要条件
seems to be an important condition
或某些运动方式的前提
or prerequisite for certain patterns of exercise
使生长激素释放最大化
to maximize growth hormone release.
所以对我来说真的很有趣
So it's really interesting to me.
我痴迷于体温
I have an obsession with how body temperature,
光照  运动  食物这些因素之间的关联
light exercise and food interact.
事实是  如果你感到温暖
We're going right there with the fact that if you get warm,
你提高体温
you bring up the body temperature
一度或两、三度  然后开始锻炼
a degree or two or maybe three, and then start exercise.
似乎是高强度运动
It does appear that high-intensity exercise,
但是还是上一集所讨论的那样
but again as discussed in a previous episode,
不是那种直接使肌肉竭力的运动
not exercise that brings muscles to failure
但接近竭力
but close to it.
所以如果是负重运动
So if it's weight-bearing exercise,
就是接近你最大重量的那一组
it would be getting close to that final repetitions
但不是最大重量
where you can't complete them
不要超过这个限度  不要做不起来
but not pushing through those or even going to failure
但是非常接近最大重量（举不起来那个重量）
but getting close leads to anywhere
静息生长激素水平从300％提高到500％
from 300 to 500% increases in resting growth hormone levels
300至500％的生长激素增加
and 300 to 500% increases in growth hormone
一直到第二天晚上睡觉
the following night when you go to sleep,
这太不可思议了
which is incredible.
那么  我要对此进行正确剖析
Now, I want to dissect this properly.
好吧  那么其他条件之一
Okay, so one of the other conditions
再次重要的是
that seem to be important, again,
血糖要相对较低
was to have relatively low blood glucose.
所以看起来很像你需要的条件
So it's looking a lot like the conditions you need
为了获得最大的睡眠
for sleep in order to get maximum
睡眠中释放生长激素
growth hormone release in sleep.
所以不要让血糖过高或过低
So not having blood glucose too high or too low,
这本身就是一个讨论
that's a discussion unto itself.
你想有足够的精力去做运动
You want to have sufficient energy to do the exercise
身体热起来了
but getting warm,
血糖不要太高或太低
not having blood glucose too high or too low.
所以可能不能运动前  不宜进食
So probably not eating too close to exercise
在运动期间不摄取大量糖分
or not in ingesting a lot of sugars during the exercise.
事实支持了这一点
That was supported by the fact that ingestion
含热量糖的运动饮料
of a sports drink that contains caloric sugar
立即使生长激素水平保持一致
immediately flat-line the growth hormone levels.
真的很有趣
So really interesting relationship
在胰岛素  葡萄糖和生长激素之间
between insulin, glucose and growth hormone.
然后在任何地方进行训练
So then doing the training for anywhere
60至75分钟可最大限度地释放生长激素
from 60 to 75 minutes to maximize growth hormone release.
然后另一个有趣的事情
And then the other interesting thing
是即使运动后
was that even after the exercise,
降低体温
taking body temperature back down
似乎很快就恢复到正常水平
to normal levels relatively quickly seemed to be associated
这些生长激素的峰值
with these big spikes in growth hormone.
否则  生长激素中会出现巨大的下降
Otherwise, what would happen is you get these big spikes
但是如果运动时间太长
in growth hormone, but if the exercise went too long
或者如果体温持续太高的时间太长
or if body temperature remained too high for too long,
然后你不会有第二次升高增加
then you didn't get the second increase
第二天晚上体内生长激素不会升高了  好吧
in growth hormone the following night, okay?
因此  我希望我能说得很清楚
So I hope I made that abundantly clear.
好好热身  提高体温
Warm up well, get body temperature up,
运动60至75分钟
exercise 60 to 75 minutes.
不要冲会失败的重量
Don't go to absolute failure
如果你对生长激素释放感兴趣
if your interest is in growth hormone release
无论是在锻炼期间还是当晚
both during the exercise and later that night.
如果可以降低体温
And if you can bring body temperature back down
冷却至正常水平
to normal levels by cooling off,
也许是凉水淋浴或冰袋之类的东西
maybe cool shower or maybe ice pack or something,
或者只是关掉房间的暖气
or maybe just turning off the heat in the room
或走出去  不管是什么
or going outside, whatever it is,
那么你将增加
then you increase the probability
延长生长激素释放直至
that you're going to increase growth hormone
第二天晚上的概率
the following night as well.
同样  这些都是巨大的增长  可以达到300％到500％
And again, these are big increases, 300 to 500%.
几乎就像你在白天
It's almost like you're getting
进行了第二次睡觉
a second sleep during the day.
但是如果运动太辛苦  如果体温升高
But if the exercise is too hard, if body temperature
保持太兴奋时间太久  会破坏整个过程
stays too high for too long, you disrupt the whole process
而且你没有得到增加生长激素的效果
and you don't get the effect of increased growth hormone.
生长激素真的很强大
Growth hormone is really powerful
但这并不单独作用
but it doesn't work alone.
实际上  许多生长激素的作用是
In fact, a lot of the effects of growth hormone are mediated
通过其对肝脏的影响介导的
by its effects on the liver.
因此  生长激素被释放  进入肝脏
So growth hormone is released, goes to the liver,
然后肝脏释放出一种叫做IGF-1的物质
and then the liver releases something called IGF-1,
胰岛素生长因子1
insulin growth factor 1.
胰岛素生长因子1很受欢迎
Insulin growth factor 1 was popular
在神经科学领域是重点领域
in the neuroscience community as an area of focus
因为它具有触发改进记忆力的能力
because of its ability to trigger improvements
和运动后的学习能力
in memory and learning after exercise.
确实是锻炼的触发因素
And indeed exercise triggers
生长激素和IGF-1的释放
both the release of growth hormone and IGF-1.
IGF-1似乎是造成许多影响的原因
IGF-1 seems responsible for a lot of the effects
记忆力的提升
of improved memory.
有人报告说这是应有的
Some people report that that is due
增加神经元或神经发生的数量
to increased number of neurons or neurogenesis,
新神经元的诞生
birth of new neurons.
很明显  在人类中
It's pretty clear that in humans,
那不是正在发生的事情
that's not what's happening.
是的  在动物中会这样  而不是在人类中
Yes in animals, not in humans.
尽管如此  IGF-1仍具有
IGF-1 nonetheless has positive effects
在记忆和认知上的积极作用
on memory and cognition.
触发IGF-1释放的好方法
And a great way to trigger IGF-1 release
生长激素的释放是通过运动来实现的
and growth hormone release is through exercise.
那么  有趣的是
Now, the interesting thing,
以及我在这里提出IGF-1的原因
and the reason I'm bringing up IGF-1 here
是某些运动方式
is that certain patterns of exercise,
实际上  运动时间会产生不同的影响
actually duration of exercise have different effects
关于IGF-1和生长激素
on IGF-1 and growth hormone,
取决于运动是否
depending on whether or not the exercise
由男人或女人完成
is done by men or women.
我们称之为性别依赖性效应
There's what we call sex-dependent effect.
并且  性别依赖性的效果如下
And the sex-dependent effect is as follows.
在这项特殊研究和其他一些研究中
In this particular study and several others,
他们所做的是让人们锻炼身体
what they did is they had people exercise.
他们测量了生长激素和IGF-1的水平
They measured growth hormone and IGF-1 levels
从运动前  运动中和运动后的血液中摄取
from the blood before, during and after exercise.
他们可以看到最大的增长发生的时间
And they could see when the greatest increases occurred.
这是抗阻运动的标准类型
This was standard sorts of resistance exercise.
所以比如说深蹲
So some squats.
有一个像冲刺动作的运动
There was a sprint like activity.
具体的练习是什么并不重要
It doesn't really matter what the specific exercises were.
但是不能失败
None of them were to failure.
是要能做10次重复的那种
These were in kind of the 10 repetition
或更少一点  6次
or less range, six sets.
所以标准重量训练的东西
So kind of standard weight training stuff
任何人都可以做
that anyone might do.
但是有趣的是  女性能够在运动的早期
But what was interesting is that women were able to access
达到生长激素和IGF-1的最大峰值
the biggest peak in growth hormone and IGF-1 early in the exercise.
因此  在前30分钟内
So in the first 30 minutes.
因此  这意味着即使你只有30分钟
So what this means is even if you just have 30 minutes,
至少对于女性而言
at least for women, there's going to be a big increase
在开始的30分钟内检测生长激素和IGF-1  将会发现有很大的增长
in growth hormone and IGF-1 in the first 30 minutes.
对于男性而言  最大的增长发生在运动中的后面
For men, the biggest increase occurred later
大约60分钟左右
in the exercise, which was at 60 minutes or so total.
因此  性别依赖性效应很有趣
And so the sex-dependent effects are interesting.
他们指出了事实
They point to the fact
皮质醇  睾丸激素和雌激素
that things like cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen,
当然在不同水平上有所不同
which of course vary in different levels
对男人和女人都会产生影响
in men and women are going to impact
IGF-1和生长激素等物质的释放
the release of things like IGF-1 and growth hormone.
是的  他们确实控制了各种事情
And yes, they did control for all sorts of things
比如说饮食  控制体重
like diet and they controlled for weight
和以前的经验
and prior experience.
这实际上是一个很好的研究
It's actually a quite nice study.
如果你想查看一下  那是Pierce等人的作品
If you'd like to check it out, it's by a Pierce et al,
“生长激素和胰岛素生长因子-I
"Growth Hormone and Insulin Growth Factor-I
分子量同工型反应
Molecular Weight Isoform Response
抗阻运动取决于性别”
to Resistance Exercise Are Sex-Dependent"
于2020年在《内分泌学前沿》杂志上发表
in Frontiers in Endocrinology, fine journal in 2020.
所以这是最近的研究
So it's quite recent.
那么这是什么意思？
So what does this mean?
这意味着如果你正在锻炼
This means if you're exercising
而你想要释放生长激素  热身
and you want growth hormone release, warm up,
做我们一直在讨论的运动类型
do the type of exercise that we've been discussing.
女性  在开始的30分钟内
Women, in the first 30 minutes,
是你将获得最大利益的时候
is when you're going to get the maximum benefit
就生长激素和IGF-1而言
in terms of growth hormone and IGF-1.
男性  你必须坚持整个60分钟
Men, you have to keep going for the entire 60 minutes.
因此  如果你有兴趣  请不要过早用完力气
So don't tap out early if you're interested
获得生长激素和IGF-1释放在后面
in getting the growth hormone and IGF-1 release.
同样的条件适用于冷却身体
And the same conditions apply
而不是
about then cooling down and not making
锻炼持续了很长时间  以至于你没有得到
the exercise last so long that you don't get
第二天晚上生长激素的增加
the increase in growth hormone the following night.
到目前为止  我在做此播客方面的经验
My experience thus far in doing this podcast
观众有两类
is that people fall into one of two categories.
一类是  “你就告诉我该吃什么吧”
There are the just tell me what to take people,
真正渴望尝试补品的人
the people that are really eager to try supplements
可能还有处方药
and maybe in prescription compounds.
然后有些人更害羞
And then there are people who are a little bit more shy
不想补充补给
about supplementation.
他们更加专注于自己能做什么
They are more focused on what they can do
饮食  行为和类似的东西
with diet and behaviors and things of that sort.
我对两种方式没有任何偏见
I don't have a bias either way.
我尝试提供由科学文献支持的工具方法
I try and offer tools that are supported by the scientific literature.
而且我总是指出安全用量
And I always point to safety margins.
有可以增加生长激素的补品
There are supplements that can increase growth hormone
在相当大的程度上  不
to a considerable degree and no,
这些不是生长激素本身
these aren't growth hormone itself.
虽然  那当然会增加生长激素
Although, that of course will increase growth hormone
在相当大的程度上
to a considerable degree.
我们将在最后讨论处方药
We will talk about prescription drugs at the end,
不只是生长激素
not just growth hormone,
但是其他一些很突出的事情
but some other things that are quite prominently
现在正在使用中
in use right now,
特别是在娱乐行业
in particular in the entertainment industry.
有很多有趣的化合物
There are pretty interesting compounds.
但是首先让我们谈谈补品
But first let's talk about supplements.
所以这已经知道了一段时间了
So this has been known about for some time
但是精氨酸  氨基酸精氨酸
but arginine, the amino acid arginine,
以及氨基酸鸟氨酸
as well as the amino acid ornithine
可以大大增加生长激素的水平
can increase growth hormone levels substantially.
那么  精氨酸具有多种作用
Now, arginine has a number of effects.
你可以从食物中获取它  也可以从补品中获取它
You can get it from food, you can get it from supplements.
有些人以药丸形式或胶囊形式服用
Some people take it in pill form or capsule form.
实际上  有些人会通过静脉注射静脉注射
Some people will actually take it by IV, intravenously.
精氨酸的水平和数量
The levels and the amounts of arginine required
获得大量的生长激素释放增加
to get big growth hormone release increases
非常充实
is pretty substantial.
因此  有些人会在睡前服用精氨酸
So some people will take arginine before bedtime,
有些人会在运动前服用它
some people will take it before exercise.
前提又是低血糖
The prerequisite again is low blood glucose.
血糖如果很高  它会消除这种作用
Blood glucose is high, it's going to quash the effect.
人们服用的精氨酸量
The amounts of arginine that people take
从三克到十克不等
are anywhere from three grams to 10 grams,
甚至更多
or sometimes even more.
虽然  这绝对是一个更好的案例
Although, this is definitely a case of more is not better.
生长激素释放有一个阈值
There's a threshold at which growth hormone release
实际上由于服用
is actually blunted by taking
超过九克的精氨酸 而会变得钝了
more than nine grams of arginine.
那么  口服9克精氨酸估计得有很多药了
Now, nine grams of arginine orally is a lot of pills.
至少要吃九颗药
It's at minimum nine pills.
会引起一些胃肠道不适
And it can cause some GI disturbance, right?
人们会感到恶心
People can feel nauseous.
有人会吐出来
Some people will throw it up.
有些人便秘或腹泻等
Some people get some constipation or diarrhea, et cetera,
或只是胃痛
or just stomachaches.
我当然不建议人们这样做
I'm certainly not suggesting people do this
他们服用精氨酸
that they take arginine
但这就是为什么大多数研究看起来
but that's the reason why most of the studies that looked
精氨酸对生长激素水平的作用
at the role of arginine on growth hormone levels
是通过静脉输液进行静脉注射的
did it by IV, intravenous infusion.
所以有趣的是
So what's interesting, however,
是无论是通过嘴巴还是通过静脉
is that whether or not it's by mouth or by vein,
服用精氨酸可以大大增加
taking arginine can dramatically increase
生长激素的释放和水平
growth hormone release and the levels
或增加量是可变的
or the amount of increase was anywhere
从低的100开始  但基本上从400%开始
from 100 on the low-end but anywhere basically from 400
高于基线的600％
to 600% above baseline.
因此  这些都是生长激素的巨大增加
So these are huge increases in growth hormone.
那么  我从未尝试过精氨酸
Now, I've never tried arginine.
精氨酸在那里存在许多不同的目的
Arginine is out there for a number of different purposes.
其中之一是增加生长激素
One of them is to increase growth hormone.
一些补充品
Some of the supplements out there
增加生长激素包括精氨酸和鸟氨酸
to increase growth hormone include arginine and ornithine.
精氨酸确实具有扩张动脉的作用
Arginine does have the effect of dilating arterials.
并且它基本上增加了血液供应
And it basically increases blood supply.
精氨酸通路参与血管舒张
The arginine pathway is involved in vasodilation.
这实际上是通路
It's actually the pathway
那是很多药物的下游
that's downstream of a lot of drugs
用于治疗勃起功能障碍之类的东西
that are used to treat things like erectile dysfunction.
任何时候人们遇到问题
And anytime people have problems
有任何类型的外周血流
with peripheral blood flow of any kind,
他们专注于会破坏酶的化合物
they focus on compounds that will either disrupt the enzymes
或将调整氨基酸水平
or will adjust the levels of amino acids
以获得更多的血管舒张作用
to get more vasodilation.
所以以精氨酸为目的
So taking arginine for the purpose
增加生长激素也会有效果
of increasing growth hormone will also have the effect
扩张血管
of dilating blood vessels
对那些有  对不起
and for people with blood, excuse me,
患有心脏病的人  这实际上可能是一个严重的问题
with heart conditions, that actually can be a serious issue.
那么  这确实很重要
Now, here is something really important
有趣的是
and interesting to note,
这就是精氨酸水平的提高
which is that increasing arginine levels
以增加生长激素的释放为特定目标
with the specific goal of increasing growth hormone release
实际上可以短路运动的影响
can actually short circuit the effects of exercise
对生长激素
on growth hormone.
我看过的几项研究
Several studies that I looked at,
看了服用精氨酸的相互作用
looked at the interaction of taking arginine
和运动或只是精氨酸
and the exercise or just the arginine
或仅是运动
or just the exercise alone.
因此  不幸的是
And so you don't, unfortunately,
如果增加生长激素不是你的目标
if growth hormone increase is your goal,
不幸的是你不会增加生长激素800％
you don't unfortunately get to increase growth hormone 800%
通过服用精氨酸和锻炼
by taking arginine and exercising.
它似乎总是被夹在
It always seems to be clamped
大约增加300％到500％之间
at about 300 to 500% increases.
不过仍是一个大幅增加了
Still large increases.
我之所以提出这一点  有几个原因
So I make that point for several reasons.
首先  要注意精氨酸
First of all, be aware that arginine
对血管扩张有其他作用
has these other effects on vasodilation.
如果你患有心脏病  请认真对待
Take those seriously if you have a heart condition
或在任何情况下都应认真对待它们
or take them seriously in any case.
其次  你可以补充精氨酸
Second of all, you can supplement with arginine,
不运动  并获得这些大的增加
not exercise and get these big increases
通过在睡觉前服用它们来补充生长激素
in growth hormone by taking them before sleep.
但是  如果你在运动前服用精氨酸
But if you're taking the arginine before exercise,
你要短路
you're going to short circuit
或限制运动对生长激素的影响  好吧
or clamp the effects of exercise on growth hormone, okay?
所以这是一个可以使用的东西
So it's something that one could use
但它与运动没有协同作用
but it doesn't have a synergistic effect with exercise.
两个或多或少互相抵消  不为零
The two more or less cancel each other out, not to zero,
但最终会产生与你相同的效果
but you end up with the same effect you would
你做过一个还是另一个
had you done one or the other.
希望这很清楚
So hopefully that's clear.
另一件事是如果一个人的目标
The other thing is if one's goal
真的是增加血液中的精氨酸
is really to increase arginine in the blood
不管出于什么原因
for whatever reason,
精氨酸实际上可能不是做到这一点的最佳方法
arginine may not actually be the best way to do that.
由于它在肠道中的代谢方式
Because of the way it's metabolized in the gut,
它没有渠道  没有通路
it doesn't have access or get access
运输到你想要增加生长激素的组织上
to the tissues that you're most interested in in terms of increasing growth hormone
或血管舒张
or vasodilation for that matter.
在这种情况下
And in that case,
还有一种叫做L-瓜氨酸的东西
there's something else called L-citrulline
对血管扩张有很强的作用
which has powerful effects on vasodilation,
可能对生长激素水平产生强大影响
powerful effects potentially on growth hormone levels
通过精氨酸通路
via the arginine pathway.
但基本上是瓜氨酸
But basically L-citrulline,
它就像一个捐助者
it acts as sort of a donor,
或者是精氨酸的生物学先决条件
or it's kind of a biological prerequisite for arginine
并可能导致更大的精氨酸增加
and can lead to even bigger arginine increases
比你服用精氨酸本身会得到的更多
than you would get if you took arginine itself.
因此  L-瓜氨酸在那里
And so L-citrulline is out there.
请记住  任何会膨胀
Keep in mind that anything that dilates
血管的东西  会降低血压
the blood vessels will lower blood pressure.
所以L-瓜氨酸是的  会导致血流量增加
So L-citrulline, yes, will lead to increase blood flow
出于任何目的  你想要使用它
for whatever purpose you want to use it for,
无论是在健身房里还是其他地方
whether or not that's pumps in the gym or whatever.
这也可能导致
It also can lead to big increases
精氨酸和生长激素的大幅增长
in arginine and growth hormone,
但它会降低血压
but it will lower blood pressure.
因此  请注意这一点
So be aware of that.
并了解  生物学并不是那么简单
And understand that the biology isn't so straightforward.
L-瓜氨酸实际上可能是更好得到精氨酸的方法
L-citrulline may actually be the better way
比起精氨酸本身增加
to get arginine increases than arginine itself.
鸟氨酸也可以增加生长激素
And ornithine can also increase growth hormone,
尽管这也是通过间接通路进行的
although that's also through an indirect pathway.
如今  没有太多的关注点
And nowadays, there isn't a lot of focus
在鸟氨酸上  作为增加生长激素的一种方式
on ornithine as a way to increase growth hormone.
那在90年代风靡一时
That was kind of all the rage in the 90s,
不再那么多了
not so much anymore.
如今  人们真的对这种东西了如指掌
Nowadays, the people are really in the know for this stuff
倾向于专注于L-瓜氨酸
tend to focus on L-citrulline.
如果你对L-瓜氨酸或精氨酸感兴趣
And if you're interested in L-citrulline or arginine,
我强烈建议你去找我们的老朋友
I highly recommend you go to our old friend,
好朋友  examine.com
good friends, examine.com,
因为在那里你可以将其放入他们的搜索框
because there you can put it into their list.
你可以放上搜索  它是完全免费的
You can just put search and it's totally free.
它会告诉你
And it will tell you that blood pressure
血压将略有下降
will be slightly decreased.
健身房的输出将增加
Power output in the gym will increase.
对血糖有很强的作用
There's very strong effects on blood glucose.
疲劳度显着降低
Fatigue is reduced notably.
一氧化氮的大幅增加
Big increases in nitric oxide.
这也与血管扩张的增加有关
That's also related to the increase in vasodilation.
血浆精氨酸含量很高  对不起
Plasma arginine, very high, excuse me,
效果显着  研究也高度支持
notable effects, very high support for studies,
让人们能够做更多的训练量  有氧运动
which allow people more training volume, aerobic exercise,
降低动脉僵硬度
arterial stiffness is brought down.
有很多东西
There's a huge list of things.
生长激素增加
Increase in growth hormone.
因此  两项研究表明  这是双盲的
So two studies showing, this was done double-blind.
太好了  你总是想看到双盲
Great, you always want to see double-blind,
安慰剂对照
placebo controlled.
这仅在男性中完成  而在女性中没有完成
This was only done in males, not in females.
不幸的是  只有男性的数据
Unfortunately, just have data from males
但生长激素增加
but increases in growth hormone,
这虽然很小  但确实很显着
it's a small, but a real significant effect.
再一次  来自高质量研究
And again, from quality studies.
因此  那里有大量的效果
So there's a huge number of effects there.
还有一些其他更有趣的
And some of the other kind of more interesting ones
关于你可能没有想到的瓜氨酸
about L-citrulline that you might not have thought about
像是肌肉的氧合作用
are things like muscle oxygenation
当我们向下滚动时  c反应蛋白减少
as we scroll down, decreases in c-reactive protein.
因此  你可能会影响很多相同的事情
So a lot of the same things that you might affect,
我是从同样的化合物中
expect, excuse me, from the same sorts of compounds
我们以前见过的
we saw before.
这里的要点是  如果你想增加生长激素
The takeaway here is if you want to increase growth hormone,
想一想精氨酸通路
think about the arginine pathway,
但精氨酸本身可能不是最佳的直接通路
but arginine itself might not be the best direct route to get there.
L-瓜氨酸可能是一个更好的选择
L-citrulline might be a better option.
但请务必认真对待
But please do consider take very seriously
对血压的影响
the effects on blood pressure.
所以我们一直在谈论重大影响
So we've been talking about big effects
通过补充或锻炼生长激素
from supplementation or exercise on growth hormone,
这种极其强大的激素
this extremely powerful hormone.
要注意的一件事是  生长激素的概况
And one thing to note is that the profile of growth hormone
随着年龄的增长  变化  我之前提到过
as we age, changes, I mentioned that earlier,
但是了解它如何变化很重要
but it's important to understand how it changes.
一件事对我来说特别有趣
One thing that's particularly interesting to me
已经四十多岁的人
as somebody who's in his 40s
实际上是在30到40岁之间
is that it's actually between ages 30 and 40
那个生长激素的量
that the amount of growth hormone
你每晚释放的东西减少了
that you release each night is reduced
扩大两倍至三倍
by two to threefold.
真是不可思议
That's really incredible.
你知道吗  我们听到了很多有关睾丸激素水平的信息
You know, we hear so much about testosterone levels
随着年龄的增长而下降或雌激素水平下降
going down as we age or estrogen levels going down.
但是如果你还记得
But if you recall
从睾丸激素和雌激素的发作
from the testosterone and estrogen episode,
我们谈到了一个事实  如果你真的看数据
we talked about the fact that if you really look
例如睾丸激素
at the data, just for instance, on testosterone,
有90多岁的男人  而且并不罕见
there are men in their 90s and they are not rare,
事实证明   他们的睾丸激素
it turns out, that are making as much testosterone
DHT  二氢睾丸激素 依然很多地生成
and DHT, dihydrotestosterone,
就像他们20多岁一样  好吧
as they were in their 20s, okay?
所以我们今天听到很多关于睾丸激素水平的信息
So we hear so much nowadays about how testosterone levels
下降  精子水平下降  等等
are dropping, sperm levels are dropping, et cetera.
我对此没有异议
And I don't dispute that.
我在那集中谈到了这一点
I talked about that in that episode.
但很明显  睾丸激素水平的个体差异很大
But it's clear that testosterone levels vary tremendously from person to person.
而且变老不一定意味着
And just getting older does not necessarily mean
睾丸激素水平正在下降
that testosterone levels are dropping.
看来生长激素水平
Growth hormone levels, it seems,
人们在30多岁和40多岁时正在下降
are dropping when people are in their 30s and 40s
而且它们正在大幅下降
and they're dropping substantially.
似乎情况就是如此
And that seems to be the case across the board.
你不会找到40多岁  50多岁和60多岁的人
You're just not going to find people in their 40s, 50s and 60s
依然在产生很多的生长激素
that are making as much growth hormone
就像他们十几岁和二十多岁的时候一样
as they were in their teens and 20s.
作为一个我真的感觉很好的人
And as somebody who, I feel really good,
但作为一个肯定会注意到的人
but as somebody who definitely noticed
当我四十多岁时
that as I got into my 40s
即使我睡了相同的时间
that even if I slept the same amount,
我依然没有像之前那样
I wasn't feeling quite
就像我说的  能够从运动中恢复过来
as I would say able to recover from exercise
或即使睡眠量相同  感觉伤口愈合更慢了
or wound healing even with the same amount of sleep.
而且我正在尝试优化很多东西
And I was trying to optimize a great number of things.
这项生长激素业务
This business of growth hormone
变得对我特别感兴趣
became a particular interest to me.
而且由于操纵生长激素的方式
And since the ways to manipulate growth hormone
在男人和女人中  是如此简单明了
in men and women are so straightforward.
而且既然每个人都在经历
And since everybody goes
在与年龄相关的功能下降中
through this age-related decline very dramatically,
在我看来  这些东西
it seems to me that the things
我们应该做的事情  例如运动
that we're supposed to be doing anyway, like exercising,
就像之前所说的  尽量不要在睡前吃
like trying not to eat too close to bedtime,
试图优化睡眠
trying to optimize sleep.
所有这些都是很棒的工具
All of these are wonderful tools
我们应该追求并且也许正在使用
that we should be pursuing and perhaps using.
他们实际上可以抵消
And they can actually offset
减少的两到三倍  对不对？
the two to three fold decrease, right?
如果我们谈论的是减少两到三倍
If we're talking about a two to threefold decrease
适用于30多岁和40多岁的人们
for people that are in their 30s and 40s.
然后我们在谈论增加
And then we're talking about increases
运动或吃补剂
from exercise or maybe from supplementation
最好是运动  提高300％至500％
but certainly from exercise of 300 to 500%.
好吧  突然之间  我们处于一个位置
Well, then, all of a sudden we're in a position
实际抵消了与年龄有关的生长激素下降
to actually offset the age-related decline
完全是通过行为
in growth hormone completely just through behaviors.
我认为这非常有趣且功能强大
And I think that's quite interesting and quite powerful.
那么  我想讨论一种方法  任何人
Now, I'd like to discuss a way that anyone
可以大大增加他们的生长激素水平
can increase their levels of growth hormone dramatically.
当我大胆地说时  我的意思是大胆
And when I say dramatically, I mean dramatically.
我待会儿再讲一些数字
I'll get to the numbers in a couple minutes.
但是我们必须记住生长激素是如何释放的
But we have to remember how growth hormone is released
首先
in the first place.
记住  这一切都始于大脑的下丘脑
Remember, it all starts in the brain, in the hypothalamus.
下丘脑是控制大脑的区域
The hypothalamus is a brain area that controls
性行为  体温调节
things like sexual behavior, temperature regulation,
昼夜节律行为  意味着你想清醒时
circadian behavior, meaning when you want to be awake
当你想入睡  侵略时  所有这些
and when you want to be asleep, aggression, all of that.
也有其他大脑区域参与其中
There are other brain areas involved too
但它拥有丰富的不同神经元集合
but it has a rich collection of different neurons
涉及所有这些非常基本的功能
involved in all these very basic functions.
那么  当我们谈论释放激素时
Now, as we talked about the releasing hormones,
生长激素释放激素
the growth hormone-releasing hormone,
它来自下丘脑的神经元
it comes from neurons in the hypothalamus.
那些然后与垂体沟通
Those then communicate with the pituitary
垂体释放生长激素
and the pituitary releases growth hormone
然后是生长激素
and then the growth hormone
作用于所有这些不同的组织  肌肉
acts on all these different tissues, muscle,
肝脏  软骨等  体内脂肪
liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat.
使他们消耗能量
Makes them use energy.
这就是为什么当生长激素水平很高时
That's why you lose body fat
你会丢失体脂肪
when growth hormone levels are high.
它可以使你生长肌肉  增强骨骼等
It makes you grow muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera.
那么  具有深远影响的事情之一
Now, one of the things that has a profound effect
在生长激素水平  生长激素释放
on growth hormone levels, growth hormone release,
是温度
is temperature.
那么  关于此的数据非常强大
Now, the data on this are very strong
数据来自两个动物研究
and the data come from both animal studies
和人类研究
and human studies.
所以有很多研究
So there are a number of studies
探索了如何使动物变冷或变热
that have explored how making animals cold or hot
可以增加生长激素
can increase growth hormone.
而且  如果你正在猜测该方向
And if you're guessing which direction this is going to go,
你可能可以想象  让动物
you can probably imagine that making animals
或者人  变得暖
or people warmer is the way to go
如果你想增加生长激素
if you want to increase growth hormone.
那么  无论何时你要提高温度
Now, anytime you're going to increase temperature
对你自己  任何其他人或动物而言  这是有风险的
of yourself or anyone else or an animal, it is risky.
我想对此非常清楚
I want to be really clear about this.
不是每个人都应该参与
Not everyone should engage
在我将要描述的行为中
in the behaviors I'm about to describe.
我应该说它有风险的原因
And I should just say the reason it's risky
不需要太多的温度升高
is it doesn't take much of a temperature increase
在大脑里   把神经元给煮熟了
in the brain to cook the brain, to cook neurons.
在那之后  神经元再也回不来了
And after that point, neurons can't come back.
人们可能会因体温过高而死亡
And people can die from hyperthermia.
就寒冷而言  我们的范围更大
We have a much greater range in terms of cold.
你还可能因体温过低而死亡
You can also die of hypothermia.
你可能会冻死
You can freeze to death.
但是你感冒的范围更大
But you have a much greater range of getting cold
比你的大脑热身
than you do warming up the brain.
但是  确实有大量数据指出了这一事实
However, there are really strong data pointing to the fact
那个桑拿  也就是故意的提高室内温度
that sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia,
不太高  但是  桑拿可以增加
not too high, however, that sauna can increase
释放生长激素和其他激素
the release of growth hormone and other hormones.
这部文献有何戏剧性
And what's so dramatic about this literature
是所报告的效果的大小
is the size of the effects that are reported.
所以首先
So first of all,
让我们谈谈这些温度升高
let's talk about these temperature increases.
是的  我将提及人们可以做的事情
And yes, I will refer to things that people can do
即使你没有桑拿
even if you don't own a sauna
因为我意识到不是每个人都有桑拿
because I realized not everybody has a sauna
在他们的后院或使用桑拿浴室
in their backyard or has access to a sauna.
因此  首先  请回顾我们的研究
So first of all, recall our study
关于在几度热身的运动
about exercise where warming up a few degrees
在运动导致更大更快的增长之前
before the exercise led to bigger and quicker increases
在运动过程中自身生长激素
in growth hormone during the exercise about itself.
所以已经指向了方向
So that already point in the direction
温度很重要
that temperature was important.
那么 温度  没有双关语
Now, the degrees, no pun intended,
我们在谈论增加体温
that we're talking about increasing body temperature
是通过进入某个地方的桑拿房
is by entering saunas that are somewhere
在华氏176度之间
between 176 degrees Fahrenheit,
那是摄氏80度
so that's 80 degrees Celsius,
一直上升到210华氏度  215华氏度
and all the way up to like 210, 215 degrees Fahrenheit.
我个人知道比这还要高的人
I personally know people that go even higher than that
但他们已经训练自己应对
but they've trained themselves to deal
很高的热量
with very high heats.
再次  高温是危险的
And again, high heat is dangerous.
你必须与你的医生联系
You must clear this with your doctor.
那么  高温下会发生什么？
Now, what happens in high heat?
高温下会发生几件事情
A couple things happen in high heat.
首先
First of all,
你心脏开始有越来越大的搏动量
you start getting bigger stroke volume of the heart.
有点像运动
Kind of like an exercise.
一旦你对耐力运动进行了良好的训练
Once you get well-trained in endurance activity,
你的中风量和血液量会越来越大
your stroke volume and the amount of blood
你的心脏每次抽动
that your heart can pump each time gets larger.
你扩张血管  对吧？
You dilate the blood vessels, right?
也有很多事情发生
There are a lot of things that happen also.
你出汗了
You're sweating.
你的身体正试图释放热量
Your body's trying to unload heat.
精氨酸会扩张血管  增加热量
Dilation of blood vessels, arginine, increases in heat.
我们开始看到并听到一个共同的主题
We're starting to see and hear a common theme.
但是看来  进入
But it appears that getting into,
我不是说要身体
I'm not saying getting the body
到华氏212度  我想非常清楚地说明
up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit, I want to be very clear,
我不是说要身体
I'm not talking about getting the body
达到最高摄氏100度
up to 100 degrees Celsius.
那太可怕了
That would be terrible.
你会死的
You would die.
但是进入非常热的环境
But entering environments where it's very hot
在短时间内
for short periods of time,
20分钟到30分钟之间的任何时间
anywhere from 20 minutes to 30 minutes,
温度是摄氏80度
where the temperature is 80 degrees Celsius
到摄氏100度或华氏175度
to 100 degrees Celsius or 175 degrees Fahrenheit,
大约或等于华氏210度
more or less, to about 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
或多或少  已显示出可以增加
more or less, has been shown to increase
16倍生长激素的释放
growth hormone release 16 fold.
是的  16倍
That's right, 16 fold.
就是1600％
That's 1,600%.
那么  对其他激素也有影响
Now, there are also effects on other hormones,
催乳素  皮质醇等
prolactin, cortisol, et cetera.
因此  本研究中描述的模式
So the pattern that was described in this study
现在有很多研究
and there've been many studies now.
重复桑拿浴的内分泌作用在17个人中完成
Endocrine effects of repeated sauna were done in 17 humans.
这是反复进行的
This was from doing this repeatedly.
所以这不是他们第一次这样做
So it wasn't the first time they did this.
他们不得不连续三天这样做
They had to do this three days in a row.
模式是进入桑拿浴20分钟
And the pattern was to get into the sauna for 20 minutes,
然后进行30分钟的冷却
followed by a 30-minute cooling period.
记住  你不想
Remember, you don't want to spend
长时间处于高温状态
long periods of time at high heat.
那会影响你的大脑和其他组织
You can cook your brain and other tissues.
如果你决定这样做  请务必小心
Be very careful as you approach this if you decide to.
但是30分钟  对不起  20分钟的桑拿
But 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
然后冷却30分钟
followed by 30 minutes of cooling,
然后再进行20分钟的桑拿浴
followed by 20 minutes sauna again,
导致生长激素增加了五倍
led to a five fold increase in growth hormone.
然后日复一日地做那件事
And then by doing that day after day after day,
在第三天  你会看到这些巨大的增长
on the third day, you would see these huge increases
16倍  最大16倍
of like 16 fold, up to 16 fold.
现在  有很多这样的研究
And there are now many studies like this.
这是几年前描述的  但是从那以后
This was described a few years ago, but since then,
还有其他一些研究指出
there've been a number of other studies that have pointed
朝着故意的高温方向发展
in the direction of deliberate hyperthermia,
但不要太热以至于想去了
but not too hot that you kill yourself
为了增加生长激素
in order to increase growth hormone.
我知道我一直在强调那里的危险
And I know I keep highlighting the dangers there,
但是再说一次  当你要提高室温的时候
but again, anytime you're going to mess with heat,
你必须要谨慎  你必须要小心
you have to be cautious, you have to be careful.
因此  标准的桑拿浴室可能会有用
So standard sauna can be useful.
如果你无法使用桑拿浴室
If you don't have access to a sauna,
人们这样做的一种方式
one way that people do this,
我们必须仰望那些摔跤选手
we have to look to our friends, the wrestlers, right?
他们穿的是塑料  基本上是紧身衣裤
They wear plastics, which are basically bodysuits
相当便宜
that are fairly inexpensive
你可以在任何在线购买平台上购买的商品
that you can buy on any online purchase platform,
我应该说
I should say.
过去有些人
Some people in the old days
在他们拥有如此容易获得的塑料物品之前
before they had these plastic things so readily available.
我实际上知道  有用垃圾袋包裹自己的人
I actually knew people that wrapped themselves
然后流汗  穿连帽衫
in garbage bags and then throw on sweats and a hoodie
然后出去慢跑
and then go out for a jog.
同样  你必须非常小心
Again, you have to be really careful,
特别是在炎热的天气
especially on a hot day.
过热可导致死亡
Overheating can equate to death.
但这是升温的另一种方式
But that's another way to heat up.
你实际上不需要桑拿
You don't actually need a sauna.
我知道有人会这样做
I've known people who will do this
他们旅行时在酒店房间里
in hotel rooms while they're traveling.
他们会打开暖气  你要洗个热水澡
They'll turn on the heat, you know, make a hot bath.
他们实际上不会洗澡
They won't actually get in the bath
但是房间里会充满蒸汽和热量
but they'll fill the room with steam and heat
他们会穿上连帽衫和运动衫
and they'll put on a hoodie and some sweatshirt,
运动裤  他们会坐在那里
sweat pants, and they'll sit there
穿上羊毛袜  会变暖20分钟
with wool socks on and they'll get warm for 20 minutes,
然后他们会洗个凉澡
then they'll take a cool shower,
然后他们会再做一次
and then they'll do it again.
我猜是酒店付的水费
I guess when the hotel is paying the water bill,
但你不必担心太多
you don't worry about it too much.
当然  有些人拥有桑拿浴室
Some people of course own saunas.
有很多方法可以做到这一点
There are a lot of ways to do that.
我有一些参军的朋友
I have friends who were in the military
他们在国外时用汽车做桑拿
who made saunas out of cars while they were overseas.
各种各样的事情
All sorts of things.
你一定要小心
You do have to be careful.
我知道我已经说了很多遍了
I know I've said it many, many times.
我只是不想让任何人伤害自己
I just don't want anyone to hurt themselves.
但是这些生长激素的增加是巨大的
But these increases in growth hormone are tremendous.
他们可能源自
And what they probably stem from
下丘脑内神经元活动增加
are increased activity of neurons within the hypothalamus
刺激垂体释放生长激素
that stimulate growth hormone release from the pituitary.
那可能是
And that's probably
因为生长激素释放激素神经元
because the growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons
在下丘脑中坐得很近
in the hypothalamus sit very closely
甚至可能与某些神经元混合在一起
and may even be intermixed with some of the neurons
在下丘脑中调节热量和体温
in the hypothalamus that regulate heat and body temperature.
记住  新陈代谢是发热量
Remember, metabolism is impart a heat.
就像你消耗多少能量的熔炉
It's like a furnace of how much energy you're consuming
以及用于建筑或用于能源使用
and using for building or for energy usage purposes.
因此  桑拿非常有趣
So sauna can be very, very interesting.
再说一次  这是20分钟桑拿  然后30分钟的冷却
And again, it's 20 minutes, 30-minute cooling,
再次20分钟  请格外小心
20 minutes again, proceed with extreme caution,
但尽管如此  这些都是极端的影响
but nonetheless, these are pretty extreme effects
就他们的能力而言
in terms of their abilities
增加生长激素水平
to increase growth hormone levels.
根据温度和荷尔蒙
Along the lines of temperature and hormones,
我只想提一个最近的研究
I just want to mention a very recent study,
它刚出来
it just came out.
2021年3月  4月
March, April, 2021,
“成年男子的反复热应激的内分泌效应
"Endocrine Effects of Repeated Hot Thermal Stress
和冷水浸泡”
and Cold Water Immersion in Young Adult Men."
不幸的是  这只是在男人中
Unfortunately, it was just in men,
他们没有研究女人
they didn't look at women,
但尽管如此  我认为这些数据是相关的
but nonetheless I think the data are relevant
以每个人为总主题
to everybody as a general theme.
这是Podstawski等
This is Podstawski et al.
我将在标题中链接到该研究
I will put a link to the study in the caption
他们研究了睾丸激素
and they looked at testosterone,
催乳素  皮质醇等
prolactin, cortisol, et cetera.
他们发现桑拿是
And what they found was that the sauna
确实确实导致皮质醇显着降低
does indeed lead to a significant decrease in cortisol,
压力荷尔蒙  想要释放的荷尔蒙
a stress hormone, a hormone that you want to be released
早上起床的时候
early in the day when you wake up.
但是桑拿浴肯定会导致皮质醇显着下降
But sauna definitely led to significant decrease in cortisol
但没有改变睾丸激素  脱氢表雄酮或催乳素水平
but did not change testosterone, DHEA or prolactin levels.
这很有趣
So that's interesting.
事实证明  感冒确实影响了
And it turns out that the cold did affect
这些激素中的一些  但是那里的结果
some of these hormones but the results there
更加混杂
were a little bit more mixed.
所以这里的要点是热量
So the takeaway here is that heat
似乎对生长激素有积极作用
seems to have positive effects on growth hormone,
很大的影响
big effects.
似乎有积极作用
It seems to have positive effects
降低皮质醇水平
on reducing cortisol levels.
而且似乎没有效果
And it does not seem to have effects
直接作用于睾丸激素  脱氢表雄酮或催乳素
on things like testosterone, DHEA, or prolactin directly.
你可以想象任何激素的变化
You can imagine that a shift in any hormone
会改变其他激素的水平
is going to alter the levels of other hormones down the lines
或有间接影响
or have indirect effects
但就直接影响而言
but in terms of direct effects just during
或在桑拿浴后立即没有效果
or immediately after the sauna bath, there were no effects.
因此  我们谈到了饮食  补品
So we've talked about diet, supplementation,
行为工具
behavioral tools.
当然  我们谈到了
And of course, we talked
关于潜在的生物学和逻辑
about the underlying biology and logic.
希望你听到了安全注意事项
And hopefully you heard the safety precautions
对于所有这些
for all of those.
那么  我想简单地谈一谈
Now, I'd like to just briefly talk
关于所有这方面的处方
about the prescription side of all this.
众所周知  有很多人服用生长激素
There are, as we know, many people taking growth hormone
因为它是由医生开给他们的
because it's been prescribed to them by a doctor.
大概有人服用生长激素
And presumably there are people taking growth hormone
即使没有医生处方
even though it has not been prescribed by a doctor,
这不关我的事
which is none of my business.
但关键是大多数
But the point here is that most all
我们制造的激素中的一部分已经合成
of the hormones that we make have been synthesized.
所以有他们的版本
So there are versions of them
装在小瓶或安瓿瓶中  人们可以注射
in little bottles or little ampules that people can inject.
这里有几件重要的事情要考虑
Here are a couple of important things to consider
如果你要走那条路
if you're going to go that route.
首先  请教医生  好吧
First of all, talk to a physician, all right?
他们实际上只是通过医师才是合法可用的
They actually are only legally available through a physician.
其次  无论何时你要注入一些东西
Second of all, anytime you're injecting something,
你将要关闭自己的激素生产
you're going to shut down your own production.
那就是荷尔蒙系统起作用的方式
That's the way that the hormone system works.
如果你服用甲状腺激素  你自己就不会制造甲状腺激素
If you take thyroid hormone, you won't make thyroid hormone,
至少从长远来看
at least in the long run.
如果你服用睾丸激素
If you take testosterone,
你将关闭自己的睾丸激素生产
you will shut down your own production of testosterone.
如果服用雌激素  系统的弹性会增强一点
If you take estrogen, the system's a little more resilient
但最终你会关闭
but eventually you will shut down
你自己生产的雌激素
your production of estrogen.
生长激素也是如此
And the same is true for growth hormone.
所以决定走那条走东西的路
So a decision to go that route of taking something
并非总是永远做下去的决定
is often not always a decision to do it forever.
但是  如果你愿意维持一段时期
However, if you're willing to sustain a period
没有某种激素
of being without a given hormone,
有些人可以做一些事情  然后停止接受它们
some people can do things and then stop taking them,
然后等待一段时间
and then wait out the period
他们没有制造睾丸激素
in which they're not making testosterone,
雌激素或生长激素
estrogen or growth hormone,
然后它会回来
and then it will come back,
有时  有时不会
sometimes and sometimes it won't.
现在正在开发一种新的领域
There's a kind of new area that's developing now
我认为应该引起我们的注意
that I think deserves our attention,
不是因为我在鼓励它  而是因为它正在发生
not because I'm encouraging it, but because it is happening.
并与科学保持一致
And in keeping with the science and in keeping
尝试使事物保持现代化  这值得我们讨论
with trying to keep things modern, it's worth us discussing.
那是肽
And those are peptides.
现在你应该已经听到了很多有关肽的信息
So these days you hear a lot about peptides.
我想澄清一下什么是肽
I'd like to clarify a little bit about what peptides are.
肽是一类非常庞大的生物化合物
Peptides is a really huge category of biological compounds.
肽只是一串氨基酸  对不对？
Peptides are just strings of amino acids, right?
因此  我们谈到了L-酪氨酸  精氨酸  鸟氨酸
So we've talked about L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
这些是氨基酸
Those are amino acids.
这些是单个氨基酸
Those are individual amino acids.
然后将它们组合成小的小肽
And those are put together into little small peptides
或者它们就是所谓的多肽
or they're what are called polypeptides,
只是更长的肽
which are just longer peptides.
事实证明  对于任何物质  例如生长激素
It turns out that for any substance like growth hormone
或生长激素释放激素
or growth hormone-releasing hormone,
它是由不同的氨基酸组成的
it's made up of different amino acids
以不同的顺序
in different sequences,
就像你的基因由As和Gs组成一样
just like your genes are made up of As and Gs
和Cs和Ts  核苷酸的序列不同
and Cs and Ts, nucleotides in different sequences.
这就像一个食谱
It's like a recipe.
肽往往是氨基酸的短序列
Peptides tend to be short sequences of amino acids
足够类似于激素或类似于激素
that resemble a hormone enough or resemble
一些其他的肽  足以导致
some other peptide enough that it can lead
当你注入它们时具有相似的相同效果
to the similar same effects when you inject them.
例如  我们制作生长激素释放激素
So for example, we make growth hormone-releasing hormone
从我们的大脑中刺激生长激素
from our brain which stimulates growth hormone
从垂体
from the pituitary.
你可能现在已经讨厌我这么说了
You're probably getting tired of me saying that by now.
但是现在人们会服用诸如sermorelin之类的东西
But people now will take things like sermorelin,
瑟莫林
S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin,
这不是完整的
which is not the entire peptide sequence
生长激素释放激素肽序列
of growth hormone-releasing hormone
但这只是其中的一部分
but it's a subset of those.
当人们注射它时
And when people inject it
他们晚上睡觉之前
before they go to sleep at night
通常是空着肚子做的事情
is typically how it's done on an empty stomach.
然后刺激垂体生长激素的释放
Then that stimulates the release of growth hormone from the pituitary.
所以这不是服用生长激素
So this is not taking growth hormone,
这是在服用刺激性激素
this is taking the stimulating hormone
或通常被称为秘密模仿者或模仿者的东西  好吧
or what's often called a secretagogue or a mimic, all right?
它引起人想要的激素的分泌
It causes a secretion of the hormone that one wants.
人们也会对甲状腺激素这样做
People will do this for thyroid hormone, too.
有人在做这个
Some people are doing this
有真正医疗需要的处方
by prescription with a real medical need.
其他人只是出于长寿的原因而这样做
Other people are doing it for just longevity reasons,
这种完全是灰色地带
which kind of falls into that gray zone
没有注射 他们也不会死的
of they wouldn't die without it,
但他们想改善自己的生活  所以他们正在这样做
but they want to enhance their life and so they're doing that
因为他们相信
because they believe
对他们来说这是正确的选择  处方
it's the right thing for them, prescription.
舍莫林是处方药
Sermorelin is prescription.
它们有作用吗？
Do they work?
有
Yes.
它们会关闭你的自然生产
Do they shut down your natural production
生长激素释放激素吗？
of growth hormone-releasing hormone?
好吧  答案是肯定的
Well, there, the answer is yes
但其中某些肽实际上具有作用
but some of these peptides actually have the effect
基因表达的改变
of changing gene expression.
记住  回到起点
Remember, way back to the beginning
当我谈论荷尔蒙时
when I was talking about hormones,
他们实际上可以改变基因表达
they can actually change gene expression
他们实际上可以设定荷尔蒙通路
and they can actually set pathways in motion
是否能够持续产生激素
for continued production of a hormone
即使你停止服用该化合物
even if you stop taking the compound.
那么  这可能是好事  也可能是坏事
Now, that can be good or that can be bad
因为你记得  生长激素
because as you recall, growth hormone,
短暂的生长激素大量增加
big increases in growth hormone that are short-lived
例如桑拿  或者  我应该说运动
like sauna, or, you know, I should say exercise
或精氨酸或桑拿  似乎具有这些巨大的作用
or arginine or sauna, it seems like has these huge effects.
睡眠早期  第一阶段的睡眠
Or early nights, you know, first phase of sleep
在深夜  这类事情
early in the night, these sorts of things.
这些是暂时的
Those are transient.
但是当一个人不断地不断注射时
But when one is injecting over and over at constant level,
你可以将基因表达程序付诸实践
you can put into action gene expression programs
那可以长寿
that can be long lived.
假设你体内有一种特定的肿瘤
And let's say, you have a particular tumor in the body.
肿瘤会在看到生长激素时生长
Tumors will grow when they see growth hormone
即使那个肿瘤对你不健康  对吗？
even if that tumor is unhealthy for you, right?
你的全身组织都在生长
You've got growth of tissues all over the body.
再说一遍  我不是在说
So again, I'm not saying whether or not
人们应该去做或者不去做
people should do these things or not doing them.
我知道的一件事是  它们的使用
One thing I do know is that they are in very prominent use
在电影界非常重要
in the movie industry.
想快速去除体内脂肪的人
People who want to peel off body fat quickly,
它们确实增加了恢复时间
they do increase recovery time.
它提高恢复率
They increase healing rates.
人们也在注射诸如胃肽之类的东西
People are also injecting things like gastric peptides.
它们实际上是胃肽
They're actually stomach peptides
我们在上一集中谈到的
that we talked about in the previous episode,
ghrelin通路相关的事物
things related to the ghrelin pathway
和其他可以改善的肝脏疾病
and other things from the liver that can improve
组织和伤口愈合的速度
the rate of tissue and wound healing.
你可以打赌  在即将到来的奥运会中
You can bet that in the upcoming Olympics,
很多人正在使用肽和化合物
lot of people are using peptides and compounds
而且我并不是要特别指责任何人
and I'm not pointing fingers at anyone in particular.
只是这与荷尔蒙增加是分开的
It's just this is separate from hormone augmentation
就像注射GH或注射睾丸激素一样
of like injecting GH or injecting testosterone.
人们现在正在进一步努力
People are now working further up the pathways.
一些肽的其他名称是东西
Other names of some of the peptides are things
像伊帕莫林  替沙莫林
like ipamorelin, tesamorelin.
其中一些具有临床用途
Some of these have clinical uses.
其他化合物刚制成
Others have just been made as compounds
对于长寿领域的人们
for people in the kind of longevity field
或“自我扩充”的需要
or the self-augmentation field, if you will.
再说一遍  不提倡其使用
So again, not promoting their use
但它们肯定在那里
but they're definitely out there.
所以现在如果你听到有关它们的信息
And so now if you hear about them
或者如果有人在跟你谈论他们
or if someone's talking to you about them,
现在希望你有更好的理解
now hopefully you have a better understanding
关于他们的潜在生物学
about their underlying biology.
你可以理性地思考
And you can think rationally
关于它们是否适合你的决定
about whether or not they are the right decision for you.
好了  再次涵盖了大量的材料
Okay, once again, covered an enormous amount of material.
希望你现在了解甲状腺激素
Hopefully, now you understand thyroid hormone
以及它的作用以及它的机制
and what it does and a little bit about its mechanism
也许很多生长激素及其作用
or maybe a lot and growth hormone and what it does
以及它们俩如何照顾我们的新陈代谢
and how both of them take care of our metabolism.
它们决定了我们可以吃和利用多少营养素
They dictate how many nutrients we can eat and make use of.
他们可以从人体脂肪储存中抽出
They can pull from body fat stores,
修复肌肉  修复软骨
repair muscle, repair cartilage.
它们确实是不可思议的化合物
They really are incredible compounds.
而且它们是可行的
And they're actionable.
他们是我们可以做的事情
They're things that we can do,
就像早点入睡一样
like getting that early phase of sleep,
也许补充精氨酸  也许不补充
perhaps supplementing with arginine, maybe not,
希望有足够的运动
hopefully getting adequate exercise,
适当地热身  不要使运动时间太长
warming up properly, not making the exercise too long
或太紧张会有所帮助  也许是桑拿或类似的东西
or too intense will help, maybe sauna or things like it.
有意的  安全的热疗
You know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,
强调安全  可能是有用的东西
with the emphasis on safe, might be things that are of use.
无论如何  即使你不感兴趣
Regardless, even if you're not interested
在甲状腺或生长激素通路中
in the thyroid or the growth hormone pathways,
这结束了我们一个月的激素治疗
this brings to a close our month on hormones.
所以现在希望你能理解
And so now hopefully you understand
不只是甲状腺和生长激素
not just thyroid and growth hormone
但是甲状腺激素的逻辑基础
but the logic that underlies thyroid hormone,
生长激素  雌激素  睾丸激素  为什么吃
growth hormone, estrogen, testosterone, why we eat,
为什么我们停止进食胆囊收缩素  生长素释放肽
why we stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin.
如果这些名称对你没有任何意义
If these names don't mean anything to you,
然后也许回去听那些播客
then perhaps go back and listen to those episodes.
但是不管怎样  我希望你能离开
But regardless, I hope that you come away
由此对这些激素有更深入的了解
from this with a deeper understanding about these hormones
在控制方面如此强大
which are so powerful in controlling
我们大脑运作的方式
the way our brain functions
以及大脑和荷尔蒙之间的相互作用
and the interplay between the brain and hormones
因为它实际上是双向对话
because it is really a bidirectional conversation.
大脑告诉人体制造什么激素
The brain is telling body what hormones to make.
激素影响着人体的所有组织
The hormones are influencing all the tissues of the body
而且还告诉大脑
but also telling the brain
是否要多吃或多长
whether or not to eat more or grow more
或考虑更多  等等
or think more, et cetera.
因此  我非常感谢你的时间和关注
So I really appreciate your time and attention.
