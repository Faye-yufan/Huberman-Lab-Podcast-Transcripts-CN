-欢迎来到Huberman Lab播客
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast
我们在这里讨论科学和日常生活中基于科学的工具
where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
-我是Andrew Huberman  我是神经生物学教授
- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
斯坦福医学院的眼科和眼科
and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
此播客是单独的
This podcast is separate
从我在斯坦福大学的教学和研究职位中得出
from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
但是  这是我渴望和努力的一部分
It is however, part of my desire and effort
为你带来零成本的消费者信息
to bring you zero cost to consumer information
关于科学和科学相关工具
about science and science related tools
对公众
to the general public.
按照这个主题
And keeping with that theme,
我要感谢今天播客的赞助商
I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
我们的第一个赞助商是InsideTracker
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
InsideTracker是一个个性化的营养平台
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
分析你的血液和DNA的数据
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
帮助你更好地了解自己的身体
to help you better understand your body
并帮助你实现健康目标
and help you reach your health goals.
我一直坚信定期进行血液检查
I've long been a believer in getting regular blood tests
以及简单的原因
and the simple reason for that
这么多的因素
is that so many of the factors
影响我们的即时和长期健康
that impact our immediate and longterm health and wellbeing
只能从血液中进行分析
can only be analyzed from blood.
现在随着现代DNA测试的出现
And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
你可以获得更多信息
you can get additional layers of information
可以真正支持你的理解
that can really support your understanding
关于引擎盖下发生的事情  可以这么说
about what's going on deep under the hood, so to speak
在你的身体和大脑内部以及如何处理
inside your body and brain and what to do about it.
我认为那是InsideTracker的真正所在
And I think that's really where InsideTracker
使其与其他类似测试脱颖而出
sets itself apart from other similar tests.
首先  InsideTracker提供的是
What InsideTracker offers is, first of all,
他们使测试非常容易
they make the tests very easy.
他们可以来你家进行血液和DNA检测
They can come to your home to take your blood and DNA test
或者你可以去附近的测试中心
or you can go to a testing center nearby you.
然后你得到信息
Then you get the information back
而不仅仅是获取信息
and rather than just getting information
关于各种事物的水平
about whether or not the levels of various things
高或低
are high or low,
你还可以找到解决方法
you also get to find out what to do about it.
因此  它提供了与营养有关的指令
So it offers directives related to nutrition,
锻炼等等
to exercise and so forth.
真的可以让你掌控一切
It's really allow you to be in control
你现在和现在的整体健康状况
of your overall health, both where you are now
及其长期轨迹
and its long-term trajectory.
借助InsideTracker  他们还可以
With InsideTracker, they also have something which is
它可以让你读出内心的年龄
it can give you a readout of your inner age.
他们有一个叫做内在年龄测试的东西
They have something called the inner age test
确实可以比较你的生物学年龄
that really compares your biological age
到你的年代
to your chronological age,
非常重要和有趣的事情
something that's of extreme importance and interest
因为它与寿命或预期寿命有关
because it has to do with lifespan or predicted lifespan.

Helix Sleep也为我们带来了今天的一集
Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
Helix Sleep是一家生产床垫和枕头的公司
Helix Sleep is a company that makes mattresses and pillows
最适合你的睡眠需求
ideally suited to your sleep needs.
我一直在Helix床垫上睡觉
I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress
在过去的六个月中  我可以诚实地说
for the last six months, and I can honestly say
这是我有史以来最好的睡眠
it's the best sleep that I've ever gotten.
Helix Sleep的测验可以满足你的需求
Helix Sleep has a quiz that can match you
为你提供理想的床垫和枕头
to the ideal mattress and pillows for you.
测验大约需要两分钟
It's a quiz that takes just about two minutes,
问你一些问题  例如你倾向于一边睡一边
asks you questions like do you tend to sleep on your side
还是背在肚子上？
or your back on your stomach?
也许你不知道
Or maybe you don't know,
你是否倾向于醒来
whether or not you tend to wake up
感觉太暖还是太冷？
feeling too warm or too cold?
有关你的睡眠习惯的各种问题
Various questions about your sleep habits.
在测验结束时
At the end of that quiz,
它可以将你匹配到特定的床垫
it matches you to a specific mattress
非常适合你的睡眠需求
that's perfect for your sleep needs.
对我来说  它使我适应了黄昏  黄昏
For me, it matched me to the dusk, D-U-S-K
因为我想要一个床垫
because I wanted a mattress
那不是太坚定也不是太软弱
that wasn't too firm nor too soft
我真的很喜欢床垫
and I really love the mattress.
正如我所提到的  我一直都在睡不好觉
As I mentioned, I've been sleeping terrifically well
自从我得到那张床垫以来
ever since I got that mattress.

Theragun也为我们带来了今天的一集
Today's episode is also brought to us by Theragun.
Theragun是一种手持式冲击治疗仪
Theragun is a handheld percussive therapy device
释放深层肌肉张力
that releases deep muscle tension.
我最初是在实验室考察中了解Theragun的
I first learned about Theragun on a lab expedition.
我们实际上正前往海洋
We're actually headed out to ocean
我们曾经和大白鲨一起潜水的地方
where we were doing diving with great white sharks,
在实验室为我们的VR恐惧实验拍摄那些
filming those for our VR fear experiments in the laboratory
运送鹈鹕案的时间很长
and it was very long days of carrying Pelican cases,
这些是带有设备的硬质塑料箱
those are cases these hard plastic cases with equipment,
当时是潜水  我们一直都感到酸痛和疲倦
it was diving, we were all sore and tired all the time.
有人带来了Theragun
And someone had brought along a Theragun.
这是我第一次见到一个
It was the first time I had seen one
很快那件事就过去了
and pretty soon that thing was getting passed along
并成为机上最令人垂涎​​的设备之一
and became one of the more coveted devices on board.
每个人都想花点时间做这件事  因为那太好了
Everyone wanted time with this thing because it was great,
你可以给自己一个很棒的按摩
you could give yourself a really terrific massage
并深入组织并缓解酸痛
and get deep into the tissue and relieve soreness.
当我回来的时候  我得到了一个Theragun
When I got back, I got a Theragun
所以我很高兴他们赞助播客
and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
是否要治疗肌肉
Whether or not you want to treat your muscles
因为他们在锻炼时很紧张
because they're tense from working out
或者你是否只想释放压力
or whether or not you just want to release stress,
这是一个了不起的工具
it's a terrific tool.
你们中的许多人可能熟悉专业按摩
Many of you are familiar probably with professional massages
但是Theragun很有趣  因为你可以
but Theragun is interesting because you can
基本上给自己做一次深层组织按摩
basically give yourself a deep tissue massage,
随时随地也很安静
anytime, anywhere, it's also very quiet.
如果你想尝试Theragun  可以尝试30天
If you want to try Theragun, you can try it for 30 days.
它们的起价仅为199美元
They start at only $199.
你现在可以访问theragun.com/huberman
You can go to theragun.com/huberman right now
你今天就可以得到第四代Theragun
and you can get your gen fourth Theragun today,
那就是我使用的那个模型或他们的另一个模型
that's the one that I use or another one of their models.
那是Theragun.com/huberman来尝试Theragun
That's Theragun.com/huberman to try Theragun.
这一集标志着一个新话题的开始
This episode marks the beginning of a new topic
在Huberman Lab播客
for the Huberman Lab Podcast.
你们中许多人已经知道
As many of you already know,
我们每次用4集深入探讨一个特定的主题
we go deep into a particular topic over four,
有时甚至是五集
sometimes even five episodes.
我们刚刚结束了有关激素的主题
We just closed out the episodes on hormones.
现在我们要谈谈
Now we are going to talk
关于如何优化体能
about how to optimize physical performance
和技能学习
and skill learning.
我们将深入研究背后的科学
We're going to look deep at the science behind this
以及具体做法
as well as specific practices.
实际上  今天你将听到有关特定工具的信息
In fact, today, you're going to hear about specific tools
你可以用来最多提高耐力和力量
that you can use to improve endurance and strength by up to,
我没有吹牛皮
I'm not making this up,
你当前能力的三到四倍
three or four times your current capacity.
这是基于斯坦福大学所做的研究
This is based on studies that were done at Stanford
并正在使用中
and are currently in use
由大学和专业团队提供
by collegiate and professional teams.
如果你不是职业运动员或认真的运动员
If you're not a professional athlete or a serious athlete,
没关系
that's okay.
本月主题
The topics, this month
以及我们将要涵盖的所有信息
and all the information we are going to cover
会让你
are going to make you
一个更好的娱乐锻炼者
a better recreational exerciser as well.
如果你不是运动者
If you're not an exerciser
而你正在考虑进入
and you're thinking about getting into that
或者如果你居住在北半球
or if you live in the Northern hemisphere
而你只是在想这个夏天的海滩
and you're just thinking about the beach this summer
减脂增肌 诸如此类的事情
or fat loss, muscle building, that sort of thing,
本月  我们还将涵盖所有这些内容
this month we're going to cover all of that as well.
那里有很多混乱
There's so much confusion out there
关于如何优化减脂  增强肌肉
about how to optimize fat loss, muscle building,
例如  提高了灵活性
improvements in flexibility, for instance,
或技能学习
or skill learning.
我认识你们中的许多人  不是很专心
I know many of you, aren't so focused
关于体育锻炼的美容方面
on the cosmetic aspects of physical exercise
但对实际技能学习感兴趣
but are interested in actual skill learning,
我们也将讨论这一点
we're going to talk about that too.
我只想花一点时间
I want to just take a moment
反思上一集出现的事情
to reflect on something that came up last episode.
如果你没有看到该播客  没关系的
If you didn't see that episode, that's quite all right.
但是上一集  我们在谈论
But last episode, we were talking
关于激素  肾上腺素和皮质醇
about the hormones, adrenaline, and cortisol
以及如何利用这些注意力和学习
and how to leverage those towards attention and learning
有些小误解
and there was a little bit of confusion
我想澄清一下
that I want to clarify.
我提到了学习的最佳工具方法
I mentioned an optimal protocol for learning
涉及利用肾上腺素也称为肾上腺素
that involves leveraging adrenaline also called epinephrin
它涉及四个步骤
and it involved four steps.
我阐明的四个步骤
The four steps that I spelled out
要保持冷静和专注
were to be calm and focused
当人们试图获得或学习新技能时
while one is trying to acquire or learn the new skill,
认知技能或运动技能
cognitive skill or motor skill,
然后肾上腺素上升
then to have a spike in adrenaline.
我提到了做到这一点的方法
I mentioned ways to do that,
使用冷感或呼吸或其他工具
using cold or breathing or other tools,
学习后立即
immediately after the learning episode
然后结合我所谓的非睡眠深度休息
then to incorporate what I call non sleep deep rest,
20分钟的小睡或其他一些工具方法
a 20 minute episode of a shallow nap or some other protocol
像NSDR  非睡眠深度休息工具方法
like NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol
其中我们总是在标题中提供链接
of which we always provide links in the captions.
然后在当晚晚些时候尝试优化睡眠
And then to try and optimize sleep later that night
以及随后的夜晚好好睡觉
and the subsequent night.
你们当中有些人听到后  马上就理解了
Some of you heard this and it sunk in right away
这是很直接的
and it was straight forward.
其他人说  等等  我想上一集
Others said, wait, I thought from a previous episode
甚至在那之前  你说你应该
even before that, you said you're supposed
学习后立即做非睡眠深度休息  没有
to do non sleep deep rest immediately after learning, no.
我们又增加了一步  逻辑依旧
We added another step, the logic still follows
你想要在学习过程中保持冷静和专注
that you want to be calm and focused during learning,
那么你需要在最后增加肾上腺素
then you want to spike adrenaline at the end.
大多数人都把这搞反了
Most people get that backward,
他们喝太多咖啡
they're drinking too much coffee
甚至服用益智药和其他东西
or even taking nootropics and things,
尝试在学习时真正专注
trying to be really focused while learning.
有些人正在服用Adderall
Some people are taking Adderall recreationally
我不推荐的东西
something I don't recommend,
这实际上使整个过程倒退
that's actually getting the whole process backwards
如果你查看生理数据
if you look at the data in the physiology.
你要在最后加刺肾上腺素
You want to spike adrenaline at the end
或在学习播客后立即
or immediately after a learning episode
然后不睡觉深度休息  然后自己睡觉  好吗？
and then non sleep deep rest and then sleep itself, okay?
四个步骤  希望能为你澄清一切
Four steps, hope that clarifies things for you,
如果你还有其他问题
if you have any additional questions
请把它们放在下面的评论部分
please put them in the comment section below.
好的  让我们谈谈体能
Okay, so let's talk about physical performance.
体能有很多变数
There are so many variables to physical performance
我们可以管理体能和技能学习
and we can manage physical performance and skill learning
在各种环境条件下
from a variety of contexts.
我只是列出了一些事情的简短清单
I made just a short list of some of the things
想到可以产生巨大影响的
that come to mind that can powerfully impact
体能和技能学习
physical performance and skill learning.
其中一些是我认为基础的
Some of them are what I would consider foundational.
他们可以让你展现你当前的能力
They allow you to show up your current ability
如果你要破坏这些
and if you were to disrupt those,
你会表现不佳
you would perform less well.
所以像睡个好觉
So things like getting a good night's sleep,
像被适当地补水之类的东西
things like being properly hydrated,
诸如营养良好之类的事情
things like being well nourished,
不管对你意味着什么
whatever that means to you.
我知道你们有些人喜欢禁食运动
I know some of you like to exercise fasted,
你们中有些人喜欢在肚子里吃东西
some of you prefer to have food in your stomach
或几个小时前吃过饭
or have eaten a couple hours before.
有补品  有药物
There are supplements, there are drugs,
有不同的呼吸方式
there are different ways to breathe,
与思维定势  可视化
there are so many tools related to mindset, visualization,
有机器和设备  只是一个广阔的空间
there are machines and devices, it's just a vast space,
但这不是无限的
but it's not infinite.
事物清单中有几件事
And there are a few things in the list of things
会影响甚至优化体能
that can impact and even optimize physical performance
和技能学习产生了巨大的影响
and skill learning that have an outsized effect
任何人都可以使用
that any of you can use.
它们很多  大多数成本低至零
Many of them, most of them are low to zero costs.
所以今天我们将专注于我认为是
So today we are going to focus on what I believe to be
最强大的工具之一
one of the most powerful tools
改善体能
to improve physical performance
和技能学习与恢复
and skill learning and recovery
我们将讨论为什么这很重要
and we'll talk about why that's important
那就是温度
and that's temperature.
现在你们中的许多人可能会认为  哦  那太无聊了
Now many of you might think, oh, well that's kind of boring,
我想知道我可以服用的魔术药
I want to know about the magic pill that I can take
那将允许我灌篮
that's going to allow me to dunk a basketball
如果我目前无法做到  或者我想知道这件事
if I currently can't or I want to know about the thing
这会让我跑得更快更远
that's going to let me run further and faster
可以减少脂肪
is going to shed fat.
信不信由你  温度是最强大的变量
Believe it or not, temperature is the most powerful variable
以改善体能和恢复体力
for improving physical performance and for recovery.
我认为这比睡觉更重要
I would argue it's even more important than sleep
因为温度本身将决定温度如何
because temperature itself is going to dictate how well
以及你何时入睡和全面恢复的深度
and when you sleep and the depth of your total recovery.
温度当然有两个方面
There are two aspects to temperature of course,
有热有冷
there's heat and there's cold.
我们将主要集中在寒冷
We are mainly going to focus on cold
作为缓冲热量的一种方式
as a way to buffer heat.
在上一个播客节目中
In a previous podcast episode,
我谈到了所有的生长激素
I talked all about growth hormone.
你可以找到有关甲状腺激素和生长激素的播客
You can find that episode about fibroid and growth hormone
以及热量如何成为强有力的刺激
and how heat can be a powerful stimulus
用于增加生长激素
for increasing growth hormone
参与组织修复等
which is involved in tissue repair and et cetera
并以各种方式燃烧脂肪并改善新陈代谢
and burn fat and improve metabolism in various ways.
但是  我会认为冷感
However, cold I would argue
比热工具更强大
is even more powerful than heat as a tool
我不仅在谈论放冰袋
and I'm not just talking about putting ice packs
在肌肉酸痛或四肢和脚踝轻微扭伤
on sore muscles or slightly sprained limbs and ankles
诸如此类的事情
and things of that sort.
我们要谈论冷感
We're going to talk about cold
从热生理学的角度来看
from the standpoint of thermal physiology.
这是一本富含科学信息的文献
This is a literature that's rich in scientific information
可以追溯到上个世纪
that goes back very deep into the last century
生理学家和神经科学家发现的地方
where physiologists and neuroscientists figured out
你的身体里有不同的隔间
that there are different compartments in your body
以不同的方式加热和冷却你
that heat and cool you differently
并且利用不同的身体部位来双倍
and that you can leverage those in order to double
就像我之前提到的
and as I mentioned before
或者多倍的提高锻炼输出
even triple or quadruple your work output
力量  重复性和耐力
both strength, repetitions, and endurance.
所以这不是他们所说的效率低下
So this is not weak sauces that they say,
这是真的可以让你
this is the stuff that can
改变很多  改变运动表现的东西
really shift the needle quite a bit
不仅是这一次的成功
and it's not just about well once,
而是表现出色并且能够恢复好
it's about being able to perform well and recover
表现  让你做得更好
from that performance so that you do even better
当你不使用这些工具时
when you're not incorporating these tools
例如  在某些日子里  你无法获得冷感
on days where for instance, you can't access cold
或冰袋  冰浴或类似的东西  好吗？
or an ice pack or an ice bath or things of that sort, okay?
所以我们要讲到冷感  我们要谈一点
So we're going to cover cold, we're going to talk a little bit
关于冷热的生理以及它们如何工作
about the physiology of cold and heat and how they work
因为就像你以前听到我说的那样
because as you've probably heard me say before
如果你能了解一些机制
if you can understand some mechanism,
如果你能推动自己
if you can just push yourself
通过一点新知识
through a little bit of new knowledge,
了解一点机制
into understanding a little bit of mechanism
关于你的工作方式  你会处于一个更好的位置
about how you work, you'll be in a far better position
以最佳  最灵活的方式实施工具
to implement the tools in the best and most flexible ways
满足你的需求
for your needs.
这就是为什么在Huberman Lab播客中
This is why at the Huberman Lab Podcast,
我从不会只列一个清单
I never ever do a just list of the things
然后大家照着做  不是的
that you should do.
我不相信说  只要告诉你该怎么做  你就能准确地使用
I don't believe in that, just tell me what to do.
首先  我告诉你为什么要做某事
First, I tell you why you should do something.
它基于的逻辑框架是什么
What's the logical framework that it's grounded in
然后我们将其提炼为特定的工具方法
and then we distill that down to specific protocols.
对于那些对此不耐烦的人
For those of you that are too impatient for that,
有数百万甚至数十亿
there are millions, if not billions
其他资源  这些资源将带你
of other resources out there that will take you
进入一种将起作用的工具方法的死胡同
into the cul-de-sac of one protocol that will work
然后停止工作  或者可能无限期地为你工作
and then stop working or might work for you indefinitely,
那不是我们在这里工作的方式
that's not how we work here.
这是关于真正了解机制
This is about really understanding the mechanism
这样你就可以调整和修改内容
so that you can tweak things and modify things,
调整时间和剂量
adjust the timing and the dosage of things
并真正从这些工具和工具方法中获得最大收益
and really get the most out of these tools and protocols.
我要谈论的一切
Everything I'm going to talk about
都与耐力运动有关
pertains to both endurance exercise
力量和速度型运动
and strength and speed type exercise.
冲刺  举重  耐力工作
So sprints, weightlifting, endurance work
在某种程度上  灵活性
and to some extent, flexibility
但我们将深入探讨灵活性
but we're going to cover flexibility in depth
以及其他不常提及的功能
as well as another feature that's not often talked about
运动的柔韧性或顺畅性
which is suppleness or smoothness of movement
在随后的播客中的不同运动范围内
over different ranges of movement in a subsequent episode.
让我们从谈论温度开始
Let's start by talking about temperature.
什么是温度？
What is temperature?
温度如何影响身体
How does temperature impact the body
及其表现能力  包括学习新技能？
and its ability to perform, including learn new skills?
所以每个人可能都记得
So everyone probably remembers,
或至少听说过“稳态”这个词  对吗？
or has at least heard of the word homeostasis, right?
身体要保留
That the body wants to remain
在特定温度范围内
in a particular range of temperatures,
它不喜欢太热或太冷
that it doesn't like to be too hot or too cold.
我想从一开始就强调
And I want to emphasize from the outset
我们体内已经安装了许多机制
that there are many mechanisms that are installed into us
通过我们的进化设计和基因组
by way of our evolutionary design and our genome
意味着我们刚出生就准备好了这些东西
meaning we were just born with this stuff ready
使我们的体温保持在特定的狭窄范围内
to keep our body temperature in a particular narrow range.
过度加热只是很糟糕
Heating up too much is just plain bad.
这不仅对体能有害
It's not just bad for physical performance,
这对所有组织健康都是有害的
it's bad for all tissue health.
如果你的大脑过热  神经元就会开始死亡
If your brain heats up too much, neurons start dying
那些神经元不会回来  好吗？
and those neurons don't come back, okay?
你可能听说过神经发生
You may have heard about neurogenesis,
大脑自我再生的能力
the ability for the brain to regenerate itself
或产生新的神经元和成年
or generate new neurons and adulthood,
成年后几乎没有神经发生
there's very little neurogenesis excuse me, in adulthood,
甚至在青春期后的任何时候
even after anytime after puberty really
而且你不想失去神经元
and you don't want to lose neurons
在中枢神经系统中
in the central nervous system.
如果太热  那会发生
If you get too hot, that'll happen.
这就是所谓的高热  要避免高热
It's called hyperthermia, you want to avoid hyperthermia
而且你有很多机制
and you have many mechanisms
内置于你体内以避免过热
that are built into you to avoid becoming hyperthermic.
当我们变得太温暖时发生的另一件事
The other thing that happens when we get too warm
是我们所有的细胞都有
is that we have in all of our cells,
所谓的酶
what are called enzymes.
你通常知道某物是否是酶
You generally know if something's an enzyme
因为它以字母ASE结尾  对吗？
because it ends in the letters, A-S-E, right?
因此  脂肪酶是一种消化脂肪的酶
So lipase is an enzyme that exists to digest fats.
你有可以消化蛋白质的蛋白酶  对吗？
You have proteases that are there to digest proteins, right?
因此  无论何时你看到ASE都是一种酶
So anytime you see A-S-E chances are it's an enzyme.
酶是蛋白质  它们具有特定的结构
Enzymes are proteins, and they have a particular structure
当热量增加时  它们的结构会发生变化
and their structure becomes modified when heat increases
那不好
and that's not good.
你希望它们的结构为特定类型
You want their structure to be of a particular type.
想像一下一辆四轮汽车
Imagine a car with four wheels,
假设汽车是酵素
let's just say the car is the enzyme.
如果太热  就像两个轮子掉了一样
If it gets too hot, it's like two of the wheels fall off
那东西就不起作用了
and that thing can't function.
所以身体和自然的原因之一
So one of the reasons why the body and nature
付出了巨大的努力来建立机制
goes through so much effort to build in mechanisms
确保我们不会变得太热
to make sure that we don't become too warm
是因为当我们变暖时
is because when we get to warm,
这些酶不起作用  细胞停止起作用
these enzymes don't function, cells stop functioning,
他们不再能够产生能量
they stop being able to generate energy,
他们不再能够消化东西
they stop being able to digest things,
你不再能够思考
you stop being able to think
最终这些细胞开始完全死亡
and eventually those cells start dying off entirely.
因此  将温度保持在特定范围内确实很好
So keeping temperature in a particular range is really good,
你不想太热
you don't want to get too hot.
就冷感而言  我们有更多的灵活性
We have much more flexibility in terms of getting cold.
现在你也不想变成低温
Now you don't want to become hypothermic either.
你会因体温过低而死亡
You can die from hypothermia
就像你会因体温过高而死亡一样
just like you can die from hyperthermia.
但是  你还有很多需要冷的地方
However that you have a lot more range to be cold
比你做得太温暖好吗？
than you do to be too warm, okay?
通常来说  这个想法是保持身体和大脑
And in general, the idea is to keep the body and brain
在特定范围内  但是无论何时我们做任何事情
in a particular range but anytime we do anything,
我们的体温会发生变化
our body temperature can shift.
例如  如果你要站在篝火旁
So for instance, if you were to stand next to a campfire
或者你在炎热的天气里在外面
or you were outside on a hot day,
会发生各种事情  从你的身体中散发热量
various things would happen to dump heat from your body.
如果你在寒冷的天气里在外面
If you were outside on a cold day
或者你要去洗个冷水澡或一个冷湖
or you were to get into a cold shower or a cold lake,
各种各样的事情都会发生
various things would happen
隔离体内的热量
to insulate heat within your body.
我意识到这一切都非常简单明了
This is all pretty straightforward and obvious I realize.
那么  那些事是什么？
Now, what are those things?
好吧  其中有一大类
Well, there are a huge category of them.
当你进入冷水中时  你会分泌肾上腺素
When you get into cold water, you secrete adrenaline.
在炎热的天气里  如果真的很热或在很热的桑拿房中
On a hot day, if it's really hot or in a very hot sauna
或在炎热的沙漠中
or in the hot desert,
你将产生所谓的热休克蛋白
you will generate what are called heat shock proteins
这将引发其他系列的级联
which will set off other sets of cascades,
代谢极联反应  生物极联反应
metabolic cascades, biological cascades.
但是考虑这个过程的最简单方法是
But the simplest way to think about this process is that
当我们冷感时  我们倾向于血管收缩
when we get cold, we tend to vasoconstrict.
我们的血管趋于收缩
Our blood vessels tend to constrict
而且我们倾向于将能量推向身体的核心
and we tend to push energy toward the core of our body
保存我们的核心器官  好吗？
to preserve our core organs, okay?
因此  我们的外围  我们的手  脚和脚趾
So our periphery, our hands and our feet and our toes
而且我们的腿变冷
and our legs become colder
因此我们的核心可以维持该区域的血液
and our core therefore can maintain blood to that area
我们正在绝缘我们的核心
and we are insulating our core.
相反  当我们加热血管舒张血管时
Conversely, when we heat up our blood vessels vasodilate,
他们扩张了一点  更多的血液流向了我们的周围
they expand a bit and more blood flows to our periphery
通常  更多的血液可以在整个身体中流动
and more blood can move throughout the body generally
我们会出汗  我们会出汗  水会实际上
and we will perspire, we will sweat, water will actually
从某种程度上被抽出血
get pulled out of the blood to some extent,
通过汗腺向上移动
moved up through sweat glands
并被带到皮肤表面
and will be brought to the skin surface
为了可以将其倾倒  我们正在释放热量
so that it can be dumped, we are dumping heat.
如你所知  动物出汗的能力各不相同
Animals, as you know vary in their capacity to sweat.
骆驼等动物起初不会流汗
Some animals like camels won't start sweating at first
如果他们变热  他们会做的就是吐口水
if they heat up, what they'll do is they'll spit,
他们会随地吐口水  好吗？
they'll dump heat by spitting, okay?
狗气喘吁吁  Costello在我左边离开了
Dogs pant, Castilla is off to my left here,
当他太暖和的时候他喘气  他不会流汗
he pants when he gets too warm, he can't sweat
狗可能会稍微出汗一点
or dogs can maybe sweat a little bit.
但是我们会流汗  你可能已经注意到
But we can sweat and you've probably noticed
在炎热的天气里  你会感到温暖
that on a humid hot day, you'll feel much warmer
只是比你走路或跑步
just walking or running than you would
进行同等的锻炼或运动
with the equivalent exercise or movement
比你在寒冷的日子里要多
than you would on a cold day.
你们中的一些人可能知道这一点  但是如果你不知道
And some of you probably know this, but if you don't
原因是你在寒冷的日子里出汗
the reason is you sweat on a cold day,
但是由于空气通常是干燥的
but because the air is dry typically,
你会把汗水浮出水面
you will bring that sweat to the surface
只要你穿衣服
and provided you're wearing clothes
可以让一些空气从身体中散发出来
that allow some air to get out away from the body,
所以你只要没穿  真的很紧
so you're not wearing, you know, really tight,
你知道氨纶类的衣服或类似的东西
you know spandex type clothing or something like that,
或者  你知道海豹式莎朗裹身式服装
or, you know seal type saran wrap type clothing
汗水会蒸发到干燥的空气中
that sweat will evaporate off into the dry atmosphere.
而在潮湿的日子  你看到别人的原因
Whereas on a humid day, the reason you see people
在一个潮湿的夏日  在纽约和佛罗里达
in New York and Florida on a humid summer day
他们就像把衬衫脱掉
and they're like moving their shirts off themselves
你会看到有认识的人
and you see people with, you know
大汗斑和背部汗斑
big sweat stains and back sweat stains
而所有这些东西是因为他们正在流汗
and all this kind of stuff is because they're sweating
像往常一样  但是潮湿
as they normally would, but it's humid
所以有湿度  空气不允许转移
and so there is the humidity, the air doesn't allow transfer
汗水立即进入大气
of that sweat into the atmosphere as readily
所以你很热  好吗？
and so you're hot, okay?
因此  如果没有蒸发  你将变得更温暖
So without the evaporation, you're going to be warmer.
所以我们蒸发掉汗水  我们流汗
So we evaporate off sweat, we sweat
当我们想散发热量时  我们会进行血管舒张
and we vasodilate when we want to dump heat.
当我们想保持热量时  我们进行血管收缩
When we want to maintain heat, we vasoconstrict
而且我们往往不流汗
and we tend to not sweat.
发生的另一件事是你会感到鸡皮疙瘩
The other thing that happens is you'll get goosebumps.
有时被称为所谓的鹅痘
So-called goose pimples they're sometimes called.
这就把我们带到未完全进化完的时期
Those are a throwback to the time
在我们的大部分身体上都有皮毛  不是全部身体
where we had fur over most, not all of our body.
所有在寒冷中的哺乳动物都有一个过程
All mammals in the cold have a process
从而肾上腺素以低水平释放
whereby adrenaline is released at low levels
通常进入体内  肾上腺素激活
typically into the body, that adrenaline activates
所谓的交感纤维
what are called sympathetic fibers,
他们与同情无关
they have nothing to do with sympathy,
那些细小的纤维  是神经元
those little fibers, which are neurons,
我所说的纤维是神经元
those fibers that what I'm saying are fibers are neurons,
不是衣服纤维  而是伸入皮肤
not clothing fibers, reach up into the skin
所以你的整个身体被这些微小的神经元覆盖
so your whole body is covered with these little tiny neurons
到达皮肤  当我们冷感时
that reach up into the skin and when we are cold,
他们实际上是机械地吸收毛囊
they actually mechanically take the hair follicle
弯曲它  这是一个称为立毛的过程
and bend it up, it's a process called pilo erection,
立毛  好吗？
P-I-L-O erection, okay?
所以在炎热的天气里  你想散发热量  好吗？
So on a hot day, you want to dump heat, okay?
所以在炎热的天气里  将会发生
So on a hot day, what would happen is
你实际上看不到那些鹅痘
you'd actually not see those goose pimples
因为你要把头发放下
because you want the hairs lying down
实际上  你会认为这可以使你更加与外界隔绝
which actually you would think that might insulate you more
但实际上我们会散发更多的热量
but we'll actually let more heat dissipate out
通过皮肤
through the skin.
在寒冷的日子里  你会得到这些鹅痘或鸡皮s
On a cold day, you get these goose pimples or goosebumps
这真的只是一个古老的遗留物
which are really just an ancient carry over
从身体试图使头发直立的尝试
from the body's attempt to make hair stand up on end.
当头发一步站起来时
And when hair step stand up on end
他们在一起很近
and they're very close together
在它们之间截留空气并实际产生
that traps air in between them and actually creates
一种温暖的空气的隔热毯
a sort of insulated blanket of warm air.
如果你曾经看过像雪橇犬或沙哑的动物
If you've ever seen an animal like a a Malamute or a Husky,
你可能会想  哦  在炎热的天气里那可怜的事情
you might think, oh that poor thing on a hot day,
它有什么作用？
what does it do?
所有的头发吗？
You know, with all that hair?
好吧  这可能很温暖  所以动物通常会喘气
Well, it can be warm so the animal will typically pant
它的头发会掉下来  你可能会认为会起作用
and its hair will lay down, which you might think would act
像毯子一样  但是在寒冷的日子
as more of a blanket, but on a cold day
将会发生的事情是它们会变得非常浮肿
what'll happen is they'll become very puffy.
他们的头发会直立
Their hair will stand up on end
这实际上是在两根头发之间存热
and that's actually trapping heat between the hairs
而且它们实际上绝缘良好
and they're actually quite well insulated.
因此  非常重要的是  如果你想了解
So it's very important that if you want to understand
如何利用温度来提高体能
how you can leverage temperature for physical performance,
你必须明白
you have to understand
你有血管收缩来保存热量
that you have vasoconstriction to conserve heat,
血管舒张以散发热量
vasodilation to dump heat,
你出汗是为了散发热量
that you are sweating to dump heat,
而且你有积液
and you have conservation of fluids
为了保存热量
in order to preserve heat.
那是最重要的
That's the most important thing
在理解机制方面
in terms of understanding the mechanisms
维持和释放热量
of maintaining and dumping heat.
现在最重要的是要了解的是
And now the most important thing to understand is that
如果温度太高  这些酶不仅会停止工作
if you get too hot, not only do those enzymes stop working
但是你收缩肌肉的能力就停止了  好吗？
but your ability to contract your muscles stops, okay?
我将重复一遍  因为它至关重要
I'm going to repeat this because it's vitally important.
ATP参与了该过程
ATP is involved in the process
产生肌肉收缩
of generating muscle contractions,
参加马拉松比赛都没关系
it doesn't matter if you're running a marathon,
上瑜伽课没关系
doesn't matter if you're doing a yoga class,
不管你要蹲下700磅
doesn't matter if you're going for a 700 pound squat,
ATP可以起作用的温度范围
the range of temperatures within which ATP can function
而且肌肉可以收缩的非常狭窄
and muscles can contract is very narrow.
大约在39或40摄氏度时  它会能力减退
Somewhere around 39 or 40 degrees Celsius, it drops off
并且你将无法产生更多的收缩
and you will not be able to generate more contractions.
现在很热  但是那个温度
Now that's pretty hot, but that temperature
可以非常快速地在本地生成
can be generated locally really fast.
那么  如果你太冷了
Now, if you're too cold,
的确  很难产生肌肉收缩
it's true it's hard to generate muscle contractions.
不久前我开始做一些冷水游泳
I got into doing some cold water swimming a little while ago
我们会开玩笑说  你从水里出来
and we would joke that, you know, you come out of the water,
我们没有潜水衣
we do no wetsuits,
我不建议人们一定要这样做
I'm not recommending people do this necessarily
除非你与你在一起
unless you're with certainly
和其他熟练的人一起做  我就是
with somebody else who's skilled at doing it, which I was.
然后你出来
And you come out
而且你会感觉到你的手有爪子
and you feel like you have claws for hands.
你可以  你永远不会在手机上发短信
You can, you know, you could never text on a phone
在最初的几分钟内
for the first few minutes,
我的意思是  水非常非常冷
I mean, the water was very, very cold
而且你甚至都不能动自己的脸
and you can't even move your face
这样肌肉就会变得僵硬
and so muscles will become rigid
但是加热肌肉会导致他们无法
but heating up muscles causes them to fail to be able
产生更多的收缩
to generate more contractions.
简单地说  如果太热  就停止运动
Put simply if you get too hot, you stop exercising.
你甚至可能没有意识到
You may not even realize it
但是你会继续锻炼
but your will to exercise further,
你更努力的能力
your ability to push harder
局部系统和整个身体系统
is entirely dependent on the heat of the muscle
支配你锻炼的意愿和能力都由温度来决定
both locally and your whole system.
因此  让我们谈谈你的整个系统
So let's talk about your whole system
因为我刚刚描述了热量的散发和热量的维持
because I just described heat dumping and heat maintaining.
我告诉过你越来越热
I told you that increasing heat
使肌肉难以收缩
makes it hard for muscles to contract.
这将使你无法跑更远  更快速
It will stop you from being able to run further and faster,
它将使你无法举起更多的重量
it will stop you from being able to lift more weights,
更多组  更多重复组
more sets, more repetitions.
但是  如果你可以将温度保持在一定范围内
If you can keep temperature in range however,
在适当的范围内  你将可以做更多的工作
in a proper range, you will be able to do more work,
你将能够创建更大的输出
you will be able to create greater output,
你将能够举起更多的重量  更多的动作  更多的次数
you'll be able to lift more weight, more sets, more reps
这样你就可以跑更远了
and you'll be able to run further.
那么  我要谈的数据
Now, there are data that I'm going to talk
绝对是惊人的
about in a little bit that are absolutely striking
这强调了这一说法
that underscore that statement.
有我同事克雷格·海勒实验室的数据
There are data from my colleague Craig Heller's lab
在斯坦福大学生物学系
in the department of biology at Stanford
并且有一些正在实施的数据
and there are data that are now being implemented.
它们首先在由DARPA资助的赠款中实施
They were first implemented in a grant funded by DARPA
但现在在专业运动队中
but now in professional sports teams.
NFL团队中的许多（如果不是全部）现在都在使用这项技术
Many, if not all the NFL teams are now using this technology
以及军事用途
as well as military uses it
不只是为了体育表演  还有消防员
and not just for sports performance, but also firefighters,
建筑工人  其他专业
construction workers, other professions
高热量成为身体性能障碍的地方
where elevated heat becomes a barrier to performance
你可以利用它来真正改善你的锻炼效果
and you can leverage this to really improve your workouts.
当我说真的有所改善时  这是惊人的
And when I say really improve, it is striking.
我现在就给你一点提示
I'm going to give away a little hint of this now
然后我要告诉你更多
and then I'm going to tell you a little bit more
在我告诉你工具方法之后的数据
of the data later after I tell you the protocols.
适当冷却身体
Proper cooling of the body,
必须以非常特定的方式完成
which has to be done in a very specific way,
允许休闲运动员
has allowed recreational athletes,
大学生和典型成年人
college students and typical adults
以及职业运动员
as well as professional athletes
从做他们通常的输出
to go from doing their usual output.
在这种情况下  最容易想到的是
In this case what comes to mind best
一个特殊的职业运动员
would be a particular professional athletes
当时49人的成员
that a member of the 49ers at the time
他第一组可以做40个双杆撑体  接着30个 20 个  20个
was able to do 40 dips on his first set, 30, 20, 20,
基本上可以进行10组不需任何其他辅助的双杆撑体
basically to 10 sets of dips unassisted with anything else.
令人印象深刻
That's an impressive
特别是因为他是一个非常大的家伙
especially since he's a really large guy,
一下子做40个撑体简直太厉害了
40 dips is as a respectable,
而且都是严格执行的  直上直下标准的双杆撑体
these are strict, full, full range dips.
然后到第10组  下降的幅度很大
And then by the 10th set, there's a steep drop-off.
对特定的身体部位进行适当的冷却
Using proper cooling of particular body compartments,
在不到一周的时间内  他就能够将其提高三倍
he was able to triple that within less than a week
在那之后即使没有冷却方法
and maintain that performance
也能保持这种表现
even without the cooling approach.
所以这实际上是一种调节效应  好吗？
So it was actually a conditioning effect, all right?
我会稍等一下
I'll get back to this in a little bit
但还有其他出色的努力
but there are other fantastic leaps of effort
表现出来的性能飞跃
and leaps of performance that were demonstrated
包括耐力跑
including endurance running.
在继续之前  我只想再次强调
Before I continue any, I just want to underscore again
过热是可怕的
that overheating is terrible.
有一个著名的例子
There's a famous example of this.
这是大约10  15年前
This was about 10, 15 years ago
当一些膳食补充剂
when a number of dietary supplements
包括像肾上腺素这样的兴奋剂
that included things like epinephrin which is a stimulant,
它是一种β-肾上腺素能兴奋剂  如盐酸克仑特罗
it's a beta adrenergic stimulant, drugs like Clenbuterol,
后来被禁止参加奥运会
which were then banned from the Olympics,
仍然有娱乐用途
which are still out there have been in recreational use
它们是β肾上腺素能激动剂  所以这些是药物
which were beta adrenergic agonist so these are drugs
这种模仿肾上腺素肾上腺素的程度
that sort of mimic epinephrin adrenaline to some extent,
我知道我在这里简化了这一点
I know I'm oversimplifying this here.
由于对新陈代谢的影响  它们可改善单位损失
They improve flat loss because of the effects on metabolism
但它们会加热身体
but they heat up the body.
发生的是  这在新闻界引起了广泛的反响
And what happened was, this hit the press very widely
是高中足球运动员
is high school football players
各种职业运动员突然死亡
and various professional athletes were dropping dead
因为他们过热
because they were overheating
在练习或比赛中
during practice or in competition.
如此之多以至于瘦肉精被禁用
So much so that Clenbuterol was banned.
虽然偶尔
Although every once in a while,
有人因为使用它而遇到麻烦
somebody gets in trouble for using this,
最近在专业拳击中  有这种情况
there was an incidence of this recently
他们把原因归因于肉质不好
in professional boxing which was attributed to a bad meat
肉里含有瘦肉精
that had contained the Clenbuterol.
我不知道来源是什么
I don't know what the source was,
我对此没有任何评论
I don't have any commentary about that,
但它仍在使用中
but it still is in use,
但是这些药物会升高体温
but these drugs increased body temperature,
脂肪减少增加  但携带有严重危险
increased fat loss, but carry is severe danger
这就是热疗的危险
and that's the danger of hyperthermia.
实际上  我会争论  我想与一些人交谈
In fact, I would argue and I think in talking to some folks
在各种专业的格斗组织中
at in various professional fighting organizations
很明显  人们看到的很多死亡
it's very clear that a lot of the deaths that one sees
在专业格斗运动中可能要做
in professional combat sports may have to do
与脱水和过热一样多
as much with dehydration and overheating
就像撞到头部一样  这也很糟糕
as it does with getting hit in the head, which is also bad,
但是事情会变得复杂
but that things can compound
可以产生协同作用
that can have a synergistic effect.
只是关于这一点和体温过高的注意事项
And just a note about that and hyperthermia
这也是危险的
and it's dangerous as well.
我的第一个科学项目
My first project ever in science
旨在评估摇头丸或摇头丸的生热作用
was to evaluate the thermogenic effects of MDMA or ecstasy.
那实际上是我在大学里的毕业论文
That was my senior thesis in college actually.
我们发现的确是一些药品
And what we found was that indeed drugs
消除了你对自己有多温暖的理解
that remove your understanding of how warm you are
导致你不采取适当的行为
cause you to not take on the appropriate behaviors
给自己降温
to cool yourself, right?
因此  你的血管收缩和出汗
So your vasoconstriction and you're sweating,
那些是自主的
those are autonomic,
不管发生什么  这些都会发生
those are going to happen no matter what
除非你碰巧采取了阻止这种效果的方法
unless you happen to take something that blocks that effect.
但是  有很多事情
However, there are a lot of things
我们作为人类所做的  以防止自己过热
that we as humans do to prevent ourselves from overheating
最主要的是停止
and the main one is stop.
当我们在沙漠中奔跑时
When we are running in the desert
或当我们非常努力地奔跑而突然停下来时
or when we're running very hard and suddenly we stop,
通常是因为肌肉过热
oftentimes that's because the muscles are overheating,
这是一种潜意识的东西
it's a subconscious thing.
我们不会经常想  哦  我真的太热了
We won't often think, oh, I'm really much too warm,
只是我们会不自主地停下了脚步
it's just that we stop
这是一种自我保护机制
and it's a self-preservation mechanisms.
有时它开始得很早  有时它开始得很晚
Sometimes it kicks into early, sometimes it kicks into late.
开始得太晚  你可能会死
Kicks in too late, you can die.
1984年奥运会有一个例子
There's an instance in the 1984 Olympics
我相信第一年
where there was the first year I believe
那是一场女子马拉松比赛
that there was a women's marathon,
我认为是正确的
I think that's correct.
以及获胜的领先者或最佳选择之一
And one of the front runners or top picks for winning
正要去体育场
was heading into the stadium
突然之间  她好像迷路了
and all of a sudden, it seemed as if she was lost,
她神志开始有点游荡
she was kind of wandering around
不知道她应该去哪里
not knowing where she should go
事实上  她有能力赢得
and in fact, she was in a position to win
或至少获得第二名  至少获得银牌
or at least take second place, at least take silver,
但她突然完全迷失了方向  在比赛中表现惨淡
got totally disoriented and did miserably in the race
就是因为体温过高
and she was hyperthermic,
她正在抵抗那停止的反射
she was running against that reflex to stop.
因此  释放热量是关键
So dumping heat is key.
那么  如何散发热量以便安全地更长久地运动呢？
So how do you dump heat in order to perform longer safely?
好吧  为了了解这个  你必须了解
Well, in order to understand that you have to understand
身体有三个主要隔间
that the body has three main compartments
调节温度  好吗？
for regulating temperature, okay?
我们不仅有核心和外围
We don't just have a center and a periphery,
我们有三个主要隔间
we have three main compartments
特别是有一个隔间
and there's one compartment in particular
你们所有人或你们大多数人  我必须假设
that all of you or most all of you, I have to assume have
如果你能理解它是如何工作的
and if you can understand how that works,
你可以为自己的表现做很多事情
you can do tremendous things for your performance
为了你的康复
and for your recovery.
所以我要告诉你的是
So what I'm about to tell you
将使你在各种形式的锻炼中都能表现得更好
will allow you to perform better in all forms of exercise
而且它并不为人所知
and it is not commonly known,
不幸的是  我在这里尝试改变它
unfortunately, I'm here to try and change that.
你有三个隔间
You have three compartments
用于增加或散发体内的热量
for increasing or dumping heat in your body.
一个是你的核心  我们已经讨论过了
One is your core, we already talked about that.
你的核心器官  你的心脏
Your core organs, your heart,
你的肺  胰腺  肝
your lungs, your pancreas, your liver,
这是你身体的核心
this is the core of your body.
另一个是你的外围  显然是你的手臂
The other is your periphery, which are obviously your arms
还有你的腿  脚和手
and your legs and your feet and your hands.
但是还有第三点
But then there's a third component
在你身上有三个位置
which has their three locations on your body
更好地将热量从体内散发出去
that are far better at passing heat out of the body
并将凉爽带入体内
and bringing cool into the body
这样你就可以加热
such that you can heat up
或很快地到处冷却你的身体
or cool your body everywhere very quickly.
这三个区域是你的脸  你的手掌
Those three areas are your face, the palms of your hands
和脚的底部
and the bottoms of your feet.
那么  你的手和脚底上的皮肤
Now, the skin on your hands and on the bottoms of your feet
在某种程度上  你的脸上被称为无光泽的皮肤
and to some extent on your face are called glaborous skin.
那是光彩的无光的皮肤
That's G-L-A-B-O-R-O-U-S glaborous skin.
身体的那些部位有什么特别之处
And what's special about those areas of your body
而光鲜的皮肤就是安排
and the glaborous skin is that the arrangement
脉管系统  血管  毛细血管和动脉
of vasculature, of blood vessels, capillaries and arteries
这些区域的组成 与其他组织非常不同
that serve those regions is very different
比你身体其他任何地方都多
than it is elsewhere in your body.
那么  这具有古老的渊源
Now, this has ancient roots.
通常  如果你是另一只哺乳动物  例如熊
Typically, if you were another mammal, like a bear
或某种猿  你的头发会遍及整个身体
or some sort of ape, you would have hair all over your body.
现在我们都认识一些毛茸茸的人
Now we all know some pretty hairy people.
我想你听说过这些毛茸茸的人
I presume you've heard that there are these hairy people,
我认识一些毛茸茸的人
I know a few excessively hairy people
Costello毛茸茸的
and Castilla is excessively hairy
但他显然不是一个人
but he's not a person obviously
但是所有哺乳动物的身体也都有毛发
but all mammals have hair on their bodies, too.
有些人的头发很浅或很细
Some people have very light hair or very fine hair.
在这些无光泽的皮肤区域没有头发
We don't have hair on these glaborous skin regions.
那么  你当然可以有胡须或胡须的生长
Now, of course you can have beard or facial hair growth
但是仍然有像脸颊这样的区域
but there are still regions like the cheeks
以及维持这种特殊脉管系统的其他区域
and other areas that maintain this special vasculature.
好吧  从技术上讲  手和脚
Okay, so technically the hands and feet
是真正的光彩皮肤
are real glaborous skin
而且脸部并不总是被归类为光彩夺目
and the face is not always quite classified as glaborous
但是这三个位置都是手掌
but these three locations face, palms of hands
脚的上下都不是很好的散热工具
not tops and bottoms of feet are very good at dumping heat
并带来了酷感
and bringing in cool.
原因是血管生物学有规律
And the reason is there's a rule in vascular biology
血液从动脉转移到毛细血管
that blood moves from arteries to capillaries
然后到静脉  然后再回到心脏  好吗？
and then to veins, and then back to the heart, okay?
所以明显是大动脉
So arteries which are the big ones obviously,
微细的毛细血管
capillaries which are the little fine ones
氧气和二氧化碳交换的地方
where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged
然后静脉将血液带回心脏
and veins which then bring blood back to the heart
当然还有其他组织
and other tissues of course.
在你的手的这三个区域中  你的脸
In these three regions of your hands, your face
和脚的根部
and the bottoms of your feet,
我们有所谓的AVA
we have what are called AVAs.
AVA是一种非常特殊的脉管系统模式
AVAs are a very special pattern of vasculature.
在医学教科书中描述了AVA
AVAs are described in the medical textbooks.
你可以在Grey的解剖图中找到它们
You can find them in Grey's anatomy
不是电视节目啊
not the television show
而是实际的格雷解剖学教科书
but the actual Grey's anatomy textbook
这是存在的真实教科书
which is a real thing that exists
在所有的医学教科书中  好吗？
and in all medical textbooks, okay?
因此  让我们谈谈AVA及其含义
So let's talk about AVAs and what they are
以及为什么它们允许身体的这三个区域
and why they allow these three regions of the body
使自己更容易地加热或冷却
to heat or cool ourselves more readily.
那么什么是AVA？
So what are AVAs?
AVA是动静脉吻合
AVAs are arterio-venous anastomosis.
所以如果你想查一下
So if you want to look that up
你可以查找AVA的静脉  毛细血管
you can just look up AVAs veins, capillaries,
如果你愿意的话  我会为你拼写
arteries if you like, but I'll spell it for you.
ARTERIO  arterio venous  VENOUS
A-R-T-E-R-I-O, arterio venous, V-E-N-O-U-S,
动静脉吻合  吻合
arterio-venous anastomosis, A-N-A-S-T-O-M-O-S-E-S.
动静脉吻合  好吗？
Arterio-venous anastomosis, okay?
你想了解动静脉吻合  请相信我
You want to know about Arterio-venous anastomosis, trust me
并且你想记住它们在你的手中
and you want to remember that they are in your hands,
脚的根部和脸部
the bottoms of your feet and on your face,
特别是在你的手掌上
and in particular on the palms of your hands,
而不是你的手掌
not the tops of your hands.
那么  在我说典型的血液流动之前
Now, before I said blood flows typically
从动脉到毛细血管  再到静脉
from arteries to capillaries, to veins,
然后回到内心
and then back to the heart.
但是AVA是直接连接
But AVAs are direct connections
在小动脉和小静脉之间
between the small arteries and the small veins.
他们在某种程度上绕过了毛细管
They bypass the capillaries to some extent.
它们是短小的血管段
They are little short vessel segments,
他们有一个很大的内径
they have a big, large inner diameter
他们的墙壁很厚  肌肉发达
and they have this very thick, muscular wall.
他们从所谓的肾上腺素能神经元获得输入
And they get input from what are called adrenergic neurons.
他们从神经元获得输入
They get input from neurons
释放去甲肾上腺素和肾上腺素
that release norepinephrine and epinephrine,
这使他们可以收缩或扩张
which allows them to contract or dilate.
现在有一些物理规则
Now there's some rules of physics
谈论管道的半径
that talk about how the radius of a pipe
管道半径的微小变化
and small changes in the radius of a pipe
导致东西的数量和数量的大量增加
leads to massive increases in the rate and amount of stuff
可以流过那根管子  好吗？
that can flow through that pipe, okay?
有一个物理规则  本质上说
There's a rule of physics that says essentially
半径与填充量成正比
that the radius is proportional to the amount of stuff
可以流到第四力量
that can flow through something to the fourth power.
我们不会把这当作物理课
We're not going to make this a physics class,
但是如果你想查找一下  可以
but if you want to look that up, you can,
你可以看看流量与半径的关系
you can just look up how does the radius of a tube or pipe relate to how quickly
有多少东西可以流过？
or how much stuff can flow through it?
你需要知道的
What you need to know,
即使你不想了解任何基础物理学
even if you don't want to know any of the underlying physics
这些AVA允许更多热量
is that these AVAs allow more heat
更快地离开身体
to leave the body more quickly
而且更酷  可以更快地进入身体
and more cool to enter the body more quickly
比其他静脉动脉毛细血管床
than other venous arterial capillary beds
整个身体
throughout the body.
换句话说  你可以在脸部  手掌上和脚的底部
In other words, you can heat up best at the face, the palms
进行更好地升温  也可以最佳冷却
and the bottoms of the feet, and you can cool down best
在脸上  手掌和脚底
at the face, the palms and the bottoms of the feet
比身体上其他任何地方效果都要好
than you can anywhere else on your body.
当我说升温或降温时
And when I say heat up or cool down,
我的意思是实际上是加热或冷却大脑  核心  以及末端
I mean actually heat or cool the core end your brain.
好的  这非常重要
Okay, so this is vitally important.
我知道现在对你们来说开始难了
I realize we're getting down
要进入这里的机制“杂草”中  但你需要知道
into the mechanistic weeds here, but you need to know
你身体的这三个部分
that these three compartments of your body,
手掌  脚底和脸
palms, bottoms of feet and face
是控制温度的最佳杠杆点
are your best leverage points for manipulating temperature
能够大大改善体能  好吗？
to vastly improve physical performance, okay?
我也想指出
I also want to point out
我要告诉你的研究
that the work that I'm going to tell you about
不是我的实验室的工作
is not work from my laboratory.
正如我提到的  这是我的工作
It's the work of, as I mentioned,
我的同事克雷格·海勒（Craig Heller）在斯坦福的实验室
my colleague Craig Heller's laboratory at Stanford
我们将作为来宾邀请Craig
and we're going to have Craig on as a guest
谈论更多关于这些发现的信息
to talk more about these discoveries,
他们是他和他的同事们的发现
they are his and his colleagues discoveries
以及如何利用它们
and how you can leverage them.
他们正在开发一些惊人的技术
They're building out some amazing technology.
我昨天和克雷格谈过
I had a conversation with Craig yesterday
作为本集的序幕
as a prelude to this episode
以及将来与他的对话
and to the future conversation with him
因此你可以获得有关此主题的最新信息
so you're getting the very latest on this topic.
那克雷格和他的同事做了什么
So what Craig and his colleagues did
确实说明得很完美
really illustrates perfectly
这些体表能做什么以及为什么
what these body surfaces can do and why.
他们正在研究运动员和军人的过热
They were studying overheating in athletes and in military
和建筑工人  并试图防止这种情况
and in construction workers and trying to prevent it.
他们做了很多实验
And they did a bunch of experiments,
我现在不去讨论所有这些
I won't go into all of them now
但他们实质上发现的是冷却手掌
but what they essentially found was that cooling the palms,
手掌冷却技术使人们  运动员
palmer cooling allowed people, athletes,
和娱乐性的运动员要跑得更远
and recreational athletes to run much further,
举起更多的重量  做更多的练习和代表
to lift more weight and to do more sets and reps
达到绝对惊人的程度
to a absolutely staggering degree.
让我们再谈一谈  再说一遍我们为什么会不由自主地停下脚步
Let's talk for a second, a bit more about why we stop,
为什么我们在太热时就停止努力
why we shut off effort when we get too hot
因为这样做  你将真正了解
because in doing so, you'll really understand
最佳工具方法如何以及为什么存在
how and why the best protocols exist
为了能够做更多的工作
for being able to do more work,
能够锻炼更长的时间
to be able to exercise longer
并且实际上感觉很好
and actually to feel good doing it.
实际上  你的双杆撑体量可以翻倍
You actually can make a doubling of your dips
或三倍或四倍或更多  真的
or believe it or not a tripling or quadrupling or more
你的引体向上也可以提高三倍或四倍或更多  真的相当简单
of your pull-ups fairly straightforward.
我之前提到过  当肌肉发热时
I mentioned before that when muscle heats up,
酶开始被破坏
enzymes start getting disrupted
ATP和肌肉不能很好地工作
and ATP and muscles can't work so well
那些肌肉无法收缩
and those muscles can't contract.
让我们更详细地说明这一点
Let's get a little more specific about that.
这里涉及的酶
The enzyme that's involved here
是一种叫做丙酮酸激酶的东西
is something called pyruvate kinase.
你不需要了解丙酮酸激酶
You don't need to know about pyruvate kinase
但是你需要知道的它是以ASE结束的
but what you do need to know is that it ends A-S-E
这意味着它是一种酶   丙酮酸激酶
which means it's an enzyme and pyruvate kinase
本质上是一个限速步骤
is essentially a rate limiting step.
这是至关重要的一步  你不能绕过
It's a critical step that you can't bypass
如果你想让肌肉收缩
if you want muscles to contract
而且对温度非常敏感
and it's very temperature sensitive.
因此  如果你可以保持较低的温度
Therefore, if you can keep temperature lower,
你可以在单位时间内做更多的运动量
you can do more work per unit time,
你可以做更多的引体向上
you can do more pull-ups
那实际上是由克雷格（Craig）完成的
and that actually was done by Craig
和他的同事们  对不起
and his colleagues, excuse me.
引体向上的实验实际上不是Craig完成的
The pull-ups weren't actually done by Craig,
我不知道克雷格能做多少个引体向上
I don't know how many pull-ups Craig can do,
下次我会问他  冷却的以及不冷却的
I'll ask him next time, both cooled and uncooled,
好想知道他可以做多少个引体向上
how many pullups he can do.
但是他们基本上做的
But what they essentially did
他们带受试者进入他们的实验室
is they brought someone into their laboratory
可以在第一组上做十个引体向上
who could do 10 pull ups on the first set
他们就能拿到10
and they were able to get 10,
休息两到三分钟再得到十个
rest two or three minutes get another 10,
休息或三分钟  如果你曾经尝试过
rest or three minutes and if you've ever tried this,
你发现的是你开始下降
what you find is that you start dropping
到八个  七个  六个等等
to eight, seven, six, et cetera.
那么  这个人可能不一定会感到
Now, the person might not necessarily feel
就像他们过热一样  但是肌肉正在发热
like they're overheating, but the muscle is heating up.
然后  既然我们知道这些AVA
Then with their knowledge that these AVAs,
这些在掌心中的传送门是一个很棒的方法
that these that these portals in the palms are a great way
既可以加热身体  又可以从身体中散发热量
to both heat the body, but also to dump heat from the body,
他们使用了设备
they used the device
我会谈谈你可以在家做什么
and I'll talk about what you can do at home
但是有这么一种  可以握住的设备
but a device where they had people hold on
本质上是一个冷管
to what was essentially a cold tube.
现在这很关键  管不能太冷
Now this is crucial, the tube can't be so cold
因为那样会引起血管收缩
that it causes vasoconstriction
因为那样冷就不会从管子里通过了
because then the cold won't pass from the tube
手和核心
to the hand and to the core.
但是如果温度合适的话
But if it's the right temperature,
既不太热也不太冷
it's neither too hot nor too cold,
冷管里的冷气传到手上
that cool from the cold tube passes into the hand,
这些所谓的“手掌”区域  然后冷却核心
these so-called palmer regions and then cools the core
从理论上讲可以降低体温
and in theory by lowering body temperature
将使人或运动员做更多的工作
would allow the person or the athlete to do more work
的确是他们所看到的
and indeed that's what they saw.
实际数据  具体数据显示
The actual data, the specific data showed
受试者可以做到的
that subjects could do,
至少他们合作过的科目
at least the subjects they worked with,
在他们的第一天  没有冷却  大约只能做一百个引体向上
on their first day with no cooling about a hundred pull-ups
是有一个大致的时间范围  好吗？
across the timeframe that they had, okay?
所以可能要花10到15
So it might've taken anywhere from 10 to 15
或更多套  取决于那个人的熟练程度
or maybe more sets depending on how skilled that person was
但要在固定的时间内
but in a fixed amount of time.
然后他们回来进行冷却
Then they came back and did the cooling.
他们隔天就做了
They did it the very next day
如果你曾经锻炼过肌肉
which if you've ever trained a muscle,
通常在第二天
the very next day typically
你在训练中做得不好
you wouldn't do as well in its training
如果前一天的训练中收到了一些伤害
if it took any damage from the previous session
或者你至少也这样做
or you at least do as well,
但是你可能不会做他们随后观察到的事情
but you probably wouldn't do what they then observed,
那是  他们每隔一组就开始比赛
which was, they started after every other set,
这个人只会握住冷管
the person would just hold the cold tube,
每隔一阵就降温身体
cool down the body after every other set,
其余的一切都保持不变
rest everything else was kept the same
他们发现他们进行了180次引体向上训练
and they found that they went to 180 pull-ups,
太不可思议了  几乎翻了一番
which is incredible, it's a near doubling.
通过在多个训练中重复执行此操作
And by doing this repeatedly over several sessions,
几个星期后  他们迅速进入冷却小组
over several weeks, they quickly went in the cooling group
我记得最多可以达到180到200个之间
from a maximum of somewhere between 180 and 200 as I recall,
我只是估计
I'm sort of estimating now,
在相同的时间内达到600个引体向上
to 600 pull-ups in the equivalent amount of time
这绝对是不可思议的
which is absolutely incredible.
然后  他们在卧推研究中重复了这一步骤
They then repeated this in a study on the bench press
实际上  卧推研究很有趣
and actually the bench press study was pretty interesting
因为他们实际上有一个对照组
because they actually had a control group
那是公认的特定金额
that was admittedly taking specific amounts
合成代谢类固醇
of anabolic steroids,
抗生素类固醇是环睾酮
the antibiotic steroid was testosterone cypionate
本质上是睾丸激素
which is essentially testosterone,
甚至是睾丸激素cypionate
and indeed the testosterone cypionate,
类固醇组以每周约1％的速度改善
the steroid group improved at a rate of about 1% per week.
会有个体差异
There were differences and the cooling group
但冷却组的表现远远超过了其他组的表现
basically left all other groups in the dust,
这真是了不起
it was just remarkable.
所以冷却核心  我想非常清楚
So cooling the core, I want to be very clear
并没有冷却肌肉
that it's not cooling the muscle,
不是要独自冷却胸部
wasn't about cooling the chest alone
或只是冷却手掌
or just cooling the palms,
这是关于让冷感通过手掌
it was about allowing cold to pass through the palms
由于那里独特的脉管系统  这些AVA
because of the unique vasculature that's there, these AVAs
允许受试者每单位时间做更多的工作
allowed the subjects to do far more work per unit time.
重要的是
And the important thing is that
如果他们在做600次引体向上运动后又回来了
if they were to come back after doing 600 pull-ups
或500个引体向上  你可能会说
or 500 pull-ups, you might say,
好吧  哇  这会造成情况
well, wow that's going to create a situation
肯定没法再次恢复到这个状态的
where recovery is going to be absolutely impossible.
他们可以回来  不用冷却
They could come back, not use the cooling
他们仍然看到了非常显着的增长
and they still saw a highly significant increase
上拉或下垂的数量或次数
in the amount or the number of pull-ups or dips
或他们可以做到的卧推重量  好吗？
or bench press weight that they could do, okay?
那是什么意思
So what that meant is that
两者都是出色的表现
it was both an excellent performance
以及出色的训练刺激
and an excellent training stimulus
他们能够从中恢复  好吗？
that they were able to recover from, okay?
我不知道大家是否都在关注
I don't know if all of you are following this
但是这种增加
but these are the sorts of increases
在运动输出中绝对是惊人的
in exercise output that are absolutely staggering
这就是为什么专业团队和军方
and that's why professional teams and the military
其他人很快就利用了它们并加以利用
and others capitalized on them very quickly and use these.
好吧  现在你可能会问耐力怎么样？
Okay, now you may be asking what about endurance, right?
并非每个人都希望能够卧推很多
Not everyone wants to be able to bench press a lot
用于多个代表和集合
for multiple reps and sets.
我应该提到卧推
And I should just mention for the bench pressing,
是的  我相信他们是
it was, I believe they were
他们找到了可以压下两个25的人
they found people that could bench press two 25,
这是两个45磅重的盘子
so that's two 45 pound plates
在45磅标准的奥运酒吧上
on the 45 pound standard Olympic bar
重复六到十次
for repetitions of anywhere from six to 10
然后让他们做同样的事情
and then they had them do the same thing.
他们做了一套  要休息两三分钟
They did a set, they'd rest two or three minutes,
有时长达四分钟
sometimes up to four minutes,
然后再做另一组  重复  重复  重复
then do another set, repeat, repeat, repeat,
通过冷却  他们能够
and with cooling, they were able
增加工作量
to increase the amount of work,
相同重量的代表次数
the number of reps with the same weight.
有时他们确实必须增加台数
Sometimes they did have to increase sets
大约增加一倍  所以这真是太棒了
to approximately double, so it was pretty fantastic.
因此  在耐力方面  也显示出类似的增长
So with endurance, similar increases have been shown
以及他们进行这些测试的方式
and the way that they do those tests
有一点不同
are a little bit different
他们还指出了一个非常重要的机制
and they also point to a really important mechanism
为什么我们根本停止工作
of why we stopped doing work at all
当我们认为自己付出了太多的努力时
when we perceive that we are putting in too much effort.
因此  它成为了
So it gets right to the heart of the relationship
在肌肉的温度和意志力之间关系的核心
between temperature in muscle and your willpower,
这些是直接相关的
those are directly related.
你的体温和意志力
Your body heat and your willpower
以生理方式联系在一起
are linked in a physiological way.
所以我不是在谈论那种
So I'm not talking about the kind of stuff
你看到的  互联网上的那种标题党
that you see as kind of like clickbait on the internet,
什么 马上增加意志力  或马上变得有弹性
or like increase willpower now or become resilient now,
或者如果你想变得坚强  就不要再做这个了
or never do this again if you want to be mentally strong,
我说的是生理机制
I'm talking about a physiological mechanism
存在于身体和大脑中导致你停止
that exists in the body and brain that causes you to stop
否则那将使你继续努力并走得更远
or that will allow you to continue to go harder and further
比平时要多
than you normally would.
好吧  让我们来谈谈意志力和热度
Okay, so let's talk about willpower and heat
以及热量如何使你失望
and how heat shuts you down.
换句话说  如果你很酷
In other words, if you are cool,
如果你的体温在特定范围内
if your body temperature is in a particular range,
你不仅可以走得更远
not only can you go further,
但是如果你愿意  你可以跑得更远
but you will go further if you want to.
换句话说  如果你加热过多
Said differently, if you heat up too much,
你会停下来  否则你会死
you will stop or you will die.
通常情况下  人们会停下来  有些人会推动
Typically people stop, there are individuals who will push
到他们昏过去的地步
to the point where they black out and die,
以同样的方式进行  请不要进行此实验
in the same way that, and please don't do this experiment,
有些人可以面对面坐下
there are people who can sit down face to face
说  让我们屏住呼吸
and say, let's hold our breath
谁先呼吸  谁就会输
and whoever breathes first loses.
有些人会一直等到痛苦为止
Some people will just go until it's painful
然后他们会喘着粗气  深吸一口气
and then they'll gasp and take a big breath.
总是有那些人
There are always those individuals
可以克服这种反射
who can override that reflex
他们会一直跑下去  运动下去  直到昏倒
and they will go until they pass out, okay?
如果你在水中这样做  很容易死亡
And if you do that in water, you can very easily die,
所以请不要做那个实验
so please don't do that experiment.
但是有一种反射将身体与大脑的联系
But there's a reflex that relates the body to the brain
以及大脑与身体的联系  打断了我们的努力
and the brain to the body that shuts off our effort
当我们太热的时候
when we get too hot.
那么Craig和他的同事以及其他人所做的
So what Craig and his colleagues and now others have done
在实验室做测试
is to do a test in the laboratory
而不是让人们跑到外面
where rather than ask people to run outside
直到他们绝对不想再跑了
until they absolutely don't want to run anymore,
你把它们放在跑步机上  然后设定速度  好吗？
you put them on a treadmill and you set the speed, okay?
所以他们必须跟上跑步机
So they have to keep up with the treadmill
然后他们退出了
and at some point they quit.
然后你参加小组  然后做那些
And you take groups and you do those
在不同的温度环境中
in different temperature environments.
所以有些人在一个寒冷的实验室里跑步
So some people are running in a nice chilly laboratory,
他们提高了自己的心率
they get their heart rate up.
因此  也许他们的心律从
So maybe their heart rate goes from,
你知道40或50的基准心率
you know, 40 or 50 baseline heart rate,
也许它上升到80或100
maybe it gets up to 80 or a hundred
然后他们将跑步机的速度保持不变
and then they keep the rate of the treadmill going the same
他们只会高原
and they'll just plateau.
所以他们正在进入稳定的节奏或节奏
So they're getting into a steady state cadence or rhythm
他们的心脏或多或少地处于稳定状态
and their heart is beating it more or less a steady state.
最终他们可能会停止
Eventually they'll probably stop
因为他们还有其他事情要做
'cause they have something else to do
但是人们会继续保持这种温度
but people will continue at that temperature
以这样的心率
and at that heart rate,
除非你开始调高房间的温度
unless you start turning up the temperature in the room
在某些时候他们会停止
and at some point they will stop
当天气变热时  它们会更早停止
and they'll stop much earlier when it gets hot
因为所谓的“心脏漂移”
because of something called cardiac drift, okay?
所以说我在跑步
So let's say I'm running
我正在这台跑步机上以稳定的节奏跑步
and I'm running at a steady cadence on this treadmill
我的心律是每分钟85次
and my heart rate is 85 beats per minute
或每分钟一百拍  没关系
or a hundred beats per minute, doesn't matter,
举例来说  假设有一百个
let's say a hundred just for sake of example.
好吧  只是让房间更热
Well, just making the room hotter
会进一步增加我的心率
is going to increase my heart rate further,
即使我的输出相同
even though I'm at the same output
大脑进行计算
and the brain does a computation,
它以某种方式找出有热量的成分
it somehow figures out that there's a heat component
这增加了心率
that's increasing heart rate
运行中需要付出努力
and there's an effort component from running
这正在驱动心率
that's driving heart rate.
如果热量分量和心率输出
And if the heat component and the heart rate output
从努力中  达到一定的门槛  我停了下来
from the effort, get to hit a certain threshold, I stop.
好的  有些人可能会认为
Okay, ad some of you may think,
好吧  有人跑了
well there are people who just run
并不断奔跑  永不停止  最终每个人都停止
and run and run and never stop, eventually everyone stops.
也许是因为比赛结束了
Maybe it's because of the race ended,
也许是因为  其他所有人都退出了
maybe it's because, you know, everyone else quit.
我实际上在网上看到了一些东西
I actually saw some stuff online,
在这些种族中  人们
there are these races where people
只会不断地做同样的循环
just will continuously do the same loop
直到其他人退学
until everyone else drops out
然后一个男孩或女孩不断超越所有人
and then one guy or girl keeps going past everybody.
但通常由于比赛结束而停止
But typically it stops because the race is over
还是因为别人退出了
or because people quit.
增加放弃或停止运动的几率
Increasing temperature increases the rate of quitting
部分而非全部  但部分
in part, not entirely, but in part
因为这个东西叫做心脏漂移
because of this thing called cardiac drift
你可能经历过的
which you've probably experienced
如果你在炎热的天气中出门在山上
if you've been out on a hot day and you're walking uphill
你可能会停止呼吸
you might stop to take a breath.
如果你坐在桑拿浴室  心率会增加
If you sit in a sauna, your heart rate will increase.
热量增加心率  努力增加心率
Heat increases heart rate, effort increases heart rate.
不断努力  你将拥有稳定的心律
At a steady effort, you'll have a steady heart rate.
如果增加环境中的热量
If you increase the heat in the environment
你正在保持稳定的心律
that you're engaging in that steady heart rate,
由于心跳  你的心率现在会上升
your heart rate will now go up due to cardiac drift
然后你会退出  好吗？
and you will quit, okay?
所以海勒和同事们做了实验
So Heller and colleagues have done experiments
他们在这些环境下进行手掌冷却
where they do palmer cooling under these environments.
这很棒  因为它不仅可以使人们
And that's wonderful because not only does it enable people
走得更远更快
to go further and faster for much longer
每次都显示出统计上的显着性
that's been shown statistically significant every time
但它也保护大脑和身体
but it also protects the brain and body
防止体温过高  过热  昏迷  神经损伤
against hyperthermia, overheating, coma, nerve injury,
神经死亡和实际死亡  好吗？
nerve death, and actual death, okay?
因此  你可以了解为什么这是一个如此有价值的工具
So you can see why this is such a valuable tool.
那他们在做什么呢？
So what are they doing?
好吧  在这种情况下  他们也要让他们凉爽的双手
Well, in this case too they're having them cool their hands
他们正在冷却手掌
and they're cooling the palms.
冷却脚底有点棘手
Cooling the bottoms of the feet is a little trickier
但实际上冷却脸也可以
but cooling the face could actually work as well.
我们将谈论冷却脸部
And we're going to talk about cooling the face
以及如何整合这一点
and how to incorporate this.
所以在这一点上  我真的很想
So at this point, I've just really wanted
给你留下深刻印象不是给你留下深刻印象  而是给你留下深刻印象
to impress upon you not impress you, but impress upon you
你拥有身体的这三个表面的事实
the fact that you have these three surfaces of your body
擅长将冷感传递到体内
that are very good at passing cold into the body,
这样可以冷却核心体温
such that it cools the core body temperature
这对健康和安全是一件好事
and that's a good thing for health and safety
为了维持工作量
and in order to maintain work output
在更长的时间内  或者实际上只是做更多的工作
over longer periods of time, or actually just do more work.
我的意思是我的结果是如此惊人
I mean to me the result is just so staggering
控制组中的人  最多能做100到180个引体向上
is the hundred to 180 pull-ups in the controls
然后在冷却组中  进行了600次引体向上  对吧？
and then 600 pull-ups in the cooled individuals, right?
他们实际上也有精神上的感觉
They actually also feel mentally
好像他们可以做更多的工作
as if they can do more work.
不只是他们可以
It's not just that they can,
他们的意志力以某种方式进行了调整
their willpower is adjusted somehow
通过这些温度变化
by these shifts in temperature.
那么  在我们继续并找到确切的方法之前
Now, before we continue and get to the exact ways
我们中的任何人都可以开始使用此信息
that any number of us can start to use this information,
我想谈谈相反的事情  那就是暖气
I want to talk about the opposite thing, which is heating.
而且你必须记住  这些表面
And you have to remember that these surfaces,
手掌  脚掌和脸部
the palms and the bottoms of the feet and the face
不只是这些AVA的范围
will not just a range with these AVAs,
这些将血液从动脉传递到静脉的特殊方法
these special ways to pass blood from arteries to veins
为了让我们凉爽  以获得更好的运动表现
in order to cool us for better athletic performance
或在寒冷的日子里给我们加热  但同时要为这两件事加热
or to heat us for on cold days but for both of those things.
那么  海勒及其同事和其他人也进行了探索
Now Heller and colleagues and others have also explored
如何将它们用于加热核心
how these can be used to heat up the core.
有时候我们想加热我们的核心
There are times when we want to heat up our core.
通常我们听到大部分热量
Typically we hear that most of the heat
从我们的头上散发出去
escapes through our heads,
所以我们出去的时候戴上帽子
so we'll put on a hat when we go outside,
这实际上是不正确的
that's actually not true.
你大部分的热量都通过脸散发
Most of your heat escapes through your face,
你的手掌和脚的底部
the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet.
现在你应该知道为什么会这样
Now you should know why that's the case.
这对手术后患者而言意味着
What this means is that for post-surgery patients
或对于体温过低的人
or for people that are hypothermic,
的确  你想加热核心  对吗？
indeed you want to heat the core, right?
但实际上我最近在游泳
But actually I was on a swim recently
一个朋友变得体温过低
where a friend became hypothermic.
他有点口齿不清
He was kind of slurring his words
摇摇晃晃
and kind of staggering around
当我们把他带回海滩时
when we got him back on the beach,
我们把他带到了救生员站
we brought him over to the lifeguard station,
他原来还好
he turned out to be fine.
同样  这就是为什么冷水游动的原因
Again, this is why cold water swims
是你真正需要跟别人一起做的事情
are something that you really need to do in groups,
并不孤单  你真的必须知道你在做什么
not alone and you really have to know what you're doing.
发生这种情况的原因有很多
There were reasons for why this happened that day,
但是  你知道我们基本上
but, you know we were basically
人们以为我们有点奇怪
people thought we were a little strange
直到他们意识到发生了什么
until they realized what was happening.
我们在沙滩上散步  基本上把他夹在中间
We were walking down the beach basically sandwiching him
在我们的胸口之间  因为我们仍然更温暖
between at our chest because we were still warmer
而不是周围环境  我们周围的环境
than the ambient environment, the environment around us.
我们把胸部推向他
And we were pushing our chest against him
试着给他热身  以使自己的核心热身
to try and warm him up to warm up his core.
回想起来  这是错误的做法
In retrospect, that was the wrong thing to do.
与克雷格交谈以及与其他同事交谈
In talking with Craig and talking to other colleagues
在生热上起作用
that work on thermogenesis.
我们应该做的是温暖的
What we should have done was warm,
碰到他的手掌  脚底
hit the palms of his hands, the bottoms of his feet
和他的脸  因为那样可以隔绝热量的流失
and his face because that would insulate the heat loss.
现在他很冷
Now he was very cold
所以大概有血管收缩
so presumably there was vasoconstriction
这些位置的静脉
of the veins at these locations.
所以还不清楚
And so it's not clear
那将是唯一使用的策略
that that would have been the only strategy to use
但是他们已经探索了如何使术后患者升温
but they have explored how to heat up post-surgery patients
也是做到这一点的最好方法之一
and one of the best ways to do that
是为了让脚底变暖的袜子
is to get warm socks on the bottoms of the feet,
戴上手套
get gloves on the hands
是否可以安全地加热脸部
and if it can be done safely to warm the face.
那么  你当然不想阻塞呼吸
Now, of course you don't want to obstruct respiration
诸如此类的事情
and things of that sort.
但是同样有将热量传递到体内的能力
But again the ability to pass heat into the body
或散发热量到身体
or to remove heat to the body
最好通过这三个表面来完成
is best done through these three surfaces.
我不能强调那么多
I can't emphasize that enough.
所以我之前提到过要冷却手掌
So I mentioned before that you want to cool the palms
或脚底
or the bottoms of the feet
虽然这很难做或面对
although that's a little harder to do or the face
但没有那么多  以至于血管收缩
but not so much that the blood vessels constrict
因为那样一来  你就无法将冷气传递到体内
because then you won't be able to pass cool into the body
因为那些管子变小了
because those pipes got smaller
因此  你无法将冷气传递到体内
and therefore you can't pass cool into the body.
那么如何开始联系在一起看呢？
So how can you start to incorporate this?
好吧  克雷格（Craig）和同事们有一家公司
Well, Craig and colleagues have a company
他们是通过斯坦福大学成立的
that they've spun out through Stanford.
我们和克雷格（Craig）坐下来谈谈
We'll talk about that when we sit down with Craig
使得工程设备最适合
that has made engineered devices that are optimal for this
将会保持这些通道的畅通
that are going to keep those passages open,
保持静脉的大小  这些静脉正确通过以保持凉爽
keep the size of the, those veins correct to pass cool
为了出色的运动表现而迅速进入人体
into the body quickly for sake of elite sports performance
甚至是休闲运动表演
and even recreational sports performance
但实际上你可以开始一起理解
but you can actually start to incorporate this.
首先  我总是被问到
First of all, I always get asked
水应该有多冷？
how cold should the water be?
应该是冰水吗？
Should it be ice water?
应该是很冷的水吗？
Should it be very cold water?
答案是不
The answer is no.
如果你想体验一下这种效果
If you want to experience some of this effect
没有设备  你可以做的一件事
without a device, one thing you could do
例如  我不知道
would be for instance to do, I dunno,
我将以健身房或跑步机为例
I'll use the, the, the gym or the treadmill as an example.
你可以做最大的引体向上  停止
You could do your maximum number of pull-ups, stop
然后你实际上可以把手伸进去
and then you could actually put your hands into
或在可能已堵塞的水槽表面上
or on the surface of a sink that is presumably stopped up
用凉水
with cool water.
所以不是冰水  不是冰冷的  而是凉水
So not ice water, not freezing cold, but cool water,
略低于体温
slightly cooler than body temperature
在开始培训之前  这将是一个不错的起点
before you started training would be a good place to start.
你需要进行10到30秒钟的操作
You do that for 10 to 30 seconds.
然后  你可以返回并进行下一组
Then you could go back and do your next set.
你将重复冷却
You would repeat the cooling,
你可能想稍微扩展一下冷却量
you would want to extend the amount of cooling somewhat
因此你可能需要30秒钟到一分钟的时间
so you might want to do that for 30 seconds to a minute.
这不是完美的
This is not going to be perfect,
你将不得不玩使其变得多么寒冷
you're going to have to play with how cold to make it
为了获得最佳效果
in order to get the optimal effect
但是你仍然应该看到一种效果
but you ought to see an effect nonetheless.
如果你正在跑步并且疲劳  也是如此
The same is true if you're running and you're fatiguing,
显然  你不想变得体温过高
obviously you don't want to become hyperthermic,
冷却手或脚底或脸部
cooling the hands or the bottoms of your feet or the face
将是理想的散热方式
would be the ideal way to dump heat
为了能够产生更多的输出
in order to be able to generate more output.
那么  关于脸部
Now, the face is something
我们没有谈论太多
that we haven't talked a lot about.
直到现在我告诉你的一切也都说
Everything I've told you up until now also says
如果你是一个容易感到冷的人
that if you are somebody who tends to get cold
当你在外面时  例如在冬天甚至秋天
when you are outside, say in the winter or even in the fall,
你往往会变冷  变暖你的脸
you tend to run cold, warming your face
将是最重要的事情
is going to be the most important thing
你可以做到的
that you can do.
那么  如果你要是只带面具  应该是会很奇怪
Now, it's kind of hard to do that without looking strange
像戴滑雪面罩之类的东西
like wearing a ski mask or something like that
但这将更加有效
but that is going to be more effective
而不是遮盖和加热身体的其他部位
than covering and warming any other part of your body
虽然如果只戴滑雪面具会很奇怪
although it'd be quite strange if you only had a ski mask on
而且你没有在身体的其他任何地方穿衣服
and you weren't wearing clothes anywhere else on your body,
我不建议在外面做
I don't recommend doing that outside,
这将使你陷入各种其他麻烦
that will get you into all sorts of other kinds of trouble.
那对任何人都不好
That wouldn't be good for anybody.
但是现在你了解了原理和位置
But now you understand the principle and the locations
在这传递热量和寒冷
at which to deliver heat and cold.
假设你要参加比赛
So let's say that you are out for a run
并且你想要结合这种冷却机制
and you want to incorporate this cooling mechanism,
我和克雷格谈过这个
I talked to Craig about this,
我说过  穷人的方式是什么
I said, what would be the kind of poor person's approach
在此设备市售之前对此有何要求？
to this before this devices commercially available?
他说  好吧  你可以拿一个冷冻的果汁罐
And he said, well, you, you could take a frozen juice can,
如果你有其中一个或非常冷的汽水罐
if you have one of those or a very cold can of soda
而你想来回传递它
and you would want to pass it back and forth
在你的两只手之间
between your two hands.
来回传递真的很重要的原因
The reason the passing back and forth is really important
是因为你  你又不想它这么冷
is because you, again you don't want it to be so cold
你收缩那些静脉门
that you constrict those veins portals
它将使冷感进入体内
that it will allow cold to go into the body.
现在肯定有人
Now, there are certainly people
在自行车把手上工作的人
that are working on bike handles,
这实际上可以使双手凉爽
and that can actually cool the hands.
你可以期待奥运会的到来
You can expect with the Olympics coming up,
人们知道这些数据
people are aware of these data
并开始将其整合到许多事物中
and are starting to incorporate it into a number of things.
这是你不想做的  有运动队
Here's what you don't want to do and there are sports teams
我不会提到名字或品牌
that I won't mention by name or brand
犯了这个错误  并付出了沉重的代价
that have made this mistake and it costs them dearly.
你不想冷却核心
You don't want to cool the core
如果你想给身体降温  对不对？
if you want to cool the body, right?
如果天气非常炎热而你要去训练
If it's very hot day and you're going to train,
首先进入冰浴  确实  它会冷却你的身体
getting into an ice bath first, sure it will cool you down,
但这不会像冷却手掌
but it's not going to be as effective as cooling the palms,
脚的底部和脸  一样有效
the bottoms of the feet and the face.
我有一个朋友在这个领域做一些重要的工作
I have a friend who does some important work in this space
与各种各样的人在一起  我们只说文化
with people in various, let's just say cultures
产生大量热量的地方
where heat is generated quite a lot
他们需要散发热量  将冰袋运送到脸上
and they need to dump heat, ice packs delivered to the face
是他们实际使用的东西
are something that they actually use
为了迅速排热
in order to dump heat quickly.
再说一次  你不想
Now, again, you don't want
使冰袋保持在你的脸上
to keep the ice pack on your face.
这些人的工作量很高  对吗？
These are people that are very high work output, right?
消防员及类似人员  工作量非常大
Firefighters and similar, at very high work output
然后他们会把这个从本质上讲
and then they'll put this essentially,
就像他们脸上的凉爽口罩
it's like a cool face mask on their face.
它可以让他们的核心体温下降
It allow their core body temperature come down
然后他们将其删除
and then they remove it,
他们没有把它放在那儿太久了
they're not keeping it on there so long
他们正在血管收缩  好吗？
that they're getting the vasoconstriction, okay?
因此  你可以通过多种方式来执行此操作
So there are a number of ways that you could do this.
再说一次  我没有给出具体的温度
And again, I'm not giving specific temperatures
因为那要看那天有多热
because it depends on how hot that day
以及你的体温有多高
and how hot your body temperature is.
因此  你可以了解为什么需要创建更多设备
So you can see why there's a need to create more devices
为此  但你可以看到很大的改进
for this, but you can see a considerable improvement
耐力  强度和各种爆炸物
in endurance, in strength and in all kinds of explosive
爆炸性功率输出
and sort of, you know, explosive power type output
在田径运动中  通过使用这些手的表面
in athletics by using these surfaces of the hands
脚底和脸
and bottoms of the feet and face.
我尝试过的那个
The one that I've tried
按照大家对这个播客的预期
because in anticipation of this episode was the dips
那我该冷却我的手
where then I would cool my hands,
我实际上也决定要冷却脚底
I actually decided to cool the bottoms of my feet as well,
因为感觉很好
because it just feels good
最近特别热
and it's particularly hot out lately,
所以不要穿鞋或袜子
so no shoes or socks on,
把我的脚放到脚底
put my feet into the bottoms of my feet
只是徘徊在一两厘米左右
just kind of hovering about a centimeter or two
一桶水的下面
below the surface of a bucket of water
那只是一点点  感觉很凉快
that was just slightly, it felt cool,
略低于体温左右
slightly cooler than body temperature or so.
基本上是从水龙头中放出来的一点
It just basically what came out of the spigot
就有一点点水
after I let it run for a little bit.
实际上我看到了60％的增长
And indeed I saw a 60% increase
我可以在一个训练中完成的双杆撑体
in the number of dips I can do in a single session.
所以这实际上是一个相当重要的影响
So it's actually a quite significant effect
而且你不必非常精确
and you don't have to be perfectly precise
为了做到这一点
in order to do it.
当然  如果你出于任何原因想要升温
And of course, if you want to heat up for whatever reason,
就像你在露营或迷失在环境中一样
like you're camping or you're lost in the environment,
记住这三个表面
remember these three surfaces
也将是加热你的最佳方式
are going to be the best way to heat your as well.
所以到目前为止  我们一直在谈论如何使用冷感
So up until now, we've been talking about how to use cold
在锻炼过程中  以提高表现
during a workout in order to improve performance
而且确实是冷却
and indeed cold applied
到身体的适当部位  适当的时间
to the appropriate parts of the body, the appropriate times
可以大大改善我们的表现
can vastly improve our performance
耐力和力量
and endurance and strength.
那么  我想谈谈温度的使用
Now, I want to talk about the use of temperature
特别是冷  来提高速度
in particular cold to improve the speed
和恢复的深度
and the depth of recovery.
恢复显然至关重要  对吧？
Recovery is obviously vital, right?
在举重训练中
During a weight training session
或在耐力训练中
or during an endurance session,
那只是下一次变得更好的刺激
that's just the stimulus for getting better the next time
如果你不康复  你不仅会变得更好
and if you don't recover, you not only won't get better,
但你会变得更糟
but you'll get worse.
对使用冷气有很多兴趣
There's a lot of interest in the use of cold
为了在短期内提高恢复能力
in order to improve recovery in the short term.
我们看到了这  也许是最好的例子
We see this and probably the best example of this
会成为格斗运动中的战士
would be fighters in combat sports
在回合或运动员之间
between rounds or athletes during
在四分之一或一半的时间之间
in between quarters or halftime,
那是恢复的一种形式
that's one form of recovery.
很快就能重新参加这项运动的能力
The ability to go back into the sport very soon
只需几分钟  大约一分钟
on an order of minutes, anywhere from like one minute
在轮次和典型的格斗运动之间
in between rounds and typical combat sports
或几分钟半的时间  等等
or several minutes and a half time, et cetera.
通常我们看到的是人们在冷却自己的核心
Typically what we see is people cooling their core,
冷却脖子的后部
cooling the back of their neck,
冷却他们的头顶
cooling the top of their heads.
因此  可能是带有冷水的海绵
So it might be, you know, a sponge with cold water
头顶上方
over the top of the head
或脖子后面的冰袋
or an ice pack on the back of the neck,
甚至在某些情况下甚至穿着冷冰背心
or in some cases even wearing cold ice vests,
这些都有人尝试
that's actually been done.
这将是一种非常低效的方式
That's going to be a very inefficient way
改善这种恢复
to improve recovery of that kind.
最好是冷却脸
Far better would be to cool the face,
手掌或脚底
the palms of the hands or the bottoms the feet
由于我到目前为止所描述的原因
for the reasons that I described up until now.
将身体浸入冰浴或冲凉水
Submerging the body in an ice bath, or taking a cold shower,
说到脖子或胸部
say up to the neck or up to the chest
或在冷水之下或在寒冷的湖中跳跃
or getting under cold water or jumping in a cold lake
或类似的东西  或在更衣室
or something of that sort, or in the locker room,
洗冷水也是快速冷却身体
getting under the cold shower also would be a terrible way
很糟糕的方法
to cool off the body quickly
与我描述的方式相比
compared to the ways that I described
穿过手掌  脚底
through the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet
或面部原因如下
or the face for the following reason.
首先  它不是在优化脸孔
First of all, it's not optimizing those portals of the face,
手掌和脚掌上的“神奇通道”
palms the hands and the feet
另外  如果天气很冷而你淹没在水里
and in addition, if it's very cold and you submerge
否则你会因冷感而掩盖很多身体
or you cover a lot of the body with that cold,
你会引起收缩
you're going to cause constriction
血管和通路的收缩
of the very vessels and pathways
使它们无法让身体有效地散发热量
that allow the body to efficiently dump heat.
再次  关键是要冷却这些
So again, the key thing is to cool these one
或其中两个或三个表面
or two or three of these surfaces
但不要太冷以至于引起血管收缩
but not so cold that you cause the vasoconstriction.
那么这对你的意义是什么？
So what does this mean for you?
这意味着进入冰浴或冷水淋浴
It means that getting in an ice bath or a cold shower
或将冰袋放在颈后
or putting an ice pack on the back of your neck
在大多数情况下不会那么好
in most cases is not going to be as good
就像泼冷水在你的脸上
as splashing cold water on your face
甚至只是用湿的凉布握住你的脸
or even just holding your face in a damp cool cloth
或类似的东西
or something of that sort.
似乎有点违反直觉
It seems kind of counterintuitive,
你想  哦  如果我跳进冰浴
you think, oh if I just jump into an ice bath,
我的冷却速度要比仅冷却
I'm going to cool down much faster than if I just cooled these,
一两个或三个
you know one or two or three
这些身体的选择区域  快得多
of these select regions of the body
但实际上并非如此
but that's actually not the case.
然后当然
And then of course
训练之间会发生恢复
there's recovery that occurs from session to session.
因此在比赛  比赛或练习之外
So outside of the game or the match or the exercise session
现在很多人都在依赖冷冻疗法
and many people are now relying on things like cryotherapy
这需要很多昂贵的设备
which requires a lot of expensive equipment,
大的  你知道液氮驱动的机器
big, you know liquid nitrogen driven machine.
这些对于大多数人来说并不常见
Those aren't so common for most people
或大多数人都可以使用  但很多人
or accessible for most people, but a lot of people
正在使用冷水浴  冰浴或冷水淋浴
are using cold baths or ice baths or cold showers.
再说一次  这不会优化身体的恢复
And again, that's not going to optimize recovery.
实际上  它将产生额外的影响
In fact, it's going to have an additional effect
这将有可能阻碍培训的刺激
that is going to potentially block the training stimulus.
的确  当你进入冰浴时
When you get into an ice bath indeed, there are,
只要不是很冷
provided it's not very, very cold,
如果你洗个冷水澡
if you get into a cold shower,
如果不是很冷
provided is not very, very cold,
你确实在阻止一些炎症
you are indeed blocking some of the inflammation
这是由于训练而发生的
that occurs because of the training session.
但是这样做也阻碍了一些通路
But in doing so you also are blocking pathways,
例如mTOR  雷帕霉素的哺乳动物靶标
such as mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin,
它参与改编
which are involved in the adaptation
使肌肉变得更强壮或更大
for a muscle to become stronger or bigger.
简单地说  遮盖住身体
Put simply, covering the body in cold
或在训练后将身体浸入寒冷中
or immersing the body in cold after training
会短路  阻止肌肉肥大
can short circuit or prevent the hypertrophy
或肌肉生长反应
or muscle growth response.
它还有其他可能是积极的影响  对吗？
It has other effects that can be positive, right?
它可以诱导生热  等等
It can induce thermogenesis, et cetera,
它可以减轻炎症
it can reduce inflammation
但是它可以防止运动的某些积极作用
but it can prevent some of the positive effects of exercise.
那么  对于耐力工作还没有做过很多检查
Now, it hasn't been examined so much for endurance work
但是  假设你是从耐力运动中回来的
but let's say you come back from around of endurance work
或跑步  骑自行车或游泳  洗个凉澡
or run or a bike or a swim, getting into a cool bath
或冷却手掌  脚底或脸部
or cooling the palms, the bottoms of the feet or the face,
我认为  基于科学会更好
in my opinion, based on the science would be better
而不是将身体完全浸入冰浴中
than completely immersing the body in the ice bath
或冷水淋浴
or the cold shower.
有的时候确实
There is a time and a place
用冰浴或冷水淋浴
for the use of the ice bath or the cold shower
或寒冷暴跌会更好一些  这些往往是
or the cold plunge, those tend to be
当你想刻意
when you want to deliberately
增加棕色脂肪的生热
increase brown fat thermogenesis
或者你想刻意锻炼心理意志力的时候
or when you want to deliberately work on mental resilience.
在随后的“减肥"播客中
And in a subsequent episode on fat loss
我将谈论如何优化冷感的使用
I'm going to talk about how to optimize the use of cold
专门用于增加新陈代谢和减脂
specifically for increasing metabolism and fat loss.
但是那么  由于我们在谈论冷的使用
But for now, since we're talking about the use of cold
为了提高运动性能和恢复
for improving performance and recovery,
我要提供的建议是基于
the suggestion that I'm going to provide is based on the work
我一直在谈论的克雷格·海勒（Craig Heller）及其同事的工作
of Craig Heller and colleagues that I've been talking about
以及我主要依靠教科书的优秀著作
as well as a excellent book I mainly rely on textbooks
和特别的书籍  它们是论文的集合
and special volume books which are collections of papers
来自特定领域的专家
from experts in a particular area
超越了标准的大学水平教科书
that go beyond standard kind of college level textbooks.
我一直依赖的那个
The one that I've been relying on
被称为“人类绩效的热调节
is called "Thermoregulation in Human Performance,
生理和生物学方面”  艾菲·马里诺（Effie Marino）
Physiological and Biological Aspects" by Effie Marino.
我不认识出版商  我也不认识作者
I don't know the publisher, I don't know the author.
我确实知道一些名字
I do recognize some of the names
那里的特定论文  但我只想清楚
of the particular papers there, but I just want to be clear
没有任何业务关系或与他们打交道
there's no sort of business relationship or deal with them
但这是一个很棒的文献
but it's an excellent text,
它被称为“人类行为中的温度调节”
it's called "Thermoregulation in Human Performance".
你可以在网上找到它
You can find it online
如果你想深入了解这一点
if you want to go really deep into this
但基本上他们显示的是
but basically what they show is that
如果你可以将身体冷却至静止温度
if you can cool the body back to its resting temperature,
对于静止温度  我的意思是
for and by resting temperature, I mean
在你将看到的范围内
within the range that you would see
在清晨的任何时候  但不能运动
at any time of waking day, but not in exercise.
因此  只需将体温降至基线即可
So just bringing that the body temperature down to baseline.
如果可以的话
If you can do that,
锻炼后越早可以做到这一点
the sooner you can do that after a workout,
肌肉越早恢复
the sooner that the muscle will recover,
肌腱会恢复
that the tendons will recover
而那个人你
and that the person you
可以重新进行更多的耐力训练
can get back into more endurance training,
更多的重量训练等等
more weight training, et cetera.
因此  寒冷实际上可以成为恢复疾病的强大工具
So cold actually can be a very powerful tool for recovery
但是为了使温度恢复到基准水平
but to maximize return to baseline levels of temperature,
根据研究我的信念
it's my belief based on the studies
在这本书中出版的
that are published in this book
以及与同事克雷格·海勒（Craig Heller）的讨论
as well as my discussions with my colleague, Craig Heller
并在整体上回顾文献
and in reviewing the literature overall
只是简单地冷却整个身体
that just simply cooling the entire body
通过跳入冰浴或冷水淋浴
by jumping into an ice bath or a cold shower
不是最好的方法
is not the best way to go.
你真的想依靠这三个中的一个
You really want to rely on one of these three
手掌无光泽的皮肤入口
glaborous skin portals of the palms,
脚或脸的底部
the bottoms of the feet or the face.
所以现在你可能比想知道的要了解更多
So now you probably know more than you ever wanted to know
关于我们如何调节体温
about how we regulate body temperature
以及如何将其应用于运动
and how it can be applied to exercise
两者都在锻炼期间
both during the exercise session
然后优化恢复
and afterward to optimize recovery.
我们很多人  大概所有人
Many of us, all of us, presumably
也在吃东西  吃东西
are also eating and drinking things and taking things
在不同的时间可能会影响此过程
at various times that can impact this process.
因此  因此  我们应该问
And so, because of that, we should ask
这些东西是否正在影响体温
whether or not those things are impacting body temperature.
当我们这样做时  我们发现有某些事情
And when we do that, we find that there are certain things
我们很多人都在做
that many of us are doing
实际上损害了我们的表现
that are actually impairing our performance.
举例来说  如果你正在锻炼前喝一杯
So for instance, if you are taking a pre-workout drink
或者你摄入了很多咖啡因或其他物质
or you're ingesting a lot of caffeine or other substance
在运动前提高体温
to bring your body temperature up before exercise,
你限制了可以做的运动量
you are limiting the amount of exercise that you can do.
我可以回忆起上大学的时间
I can recall a time in college
当我会喝很多浓缩咖啡时
when I would drink a lot of espresso
当时麻黄碱在柜台上出售
back then ephedrine was sold over the counter,
我记得吃了
I remember taking it,
它会真正激发你进行锻炼的力量
it will really energize you for workouts.
你可以产生很多能量
You can generate a lot of energy
并集中精力处理这些事情
and get extremely focused taking those things.
它们确实会增加心率  可能会非常危险
They do increase heart rate, they can be quite dangerous,
我不建议别人带他们
I don't recommend people take them.
实际上  我认为麻黄碱已经下架了
In fact, I think ephedrine is now off the shelves
作为非处方化合物
as a non prescription compound
因为各种各样的人死于服用
because various people died from taking it
对它敏感或受热的人
who were sensitive to it or exercised in heat.
但是回头看
But looking back at that,
我意识到这是一种愚蠢的做法
I realized it was a foolish approach.
它正在增加核心生热作用
It was increasing core thermogenesis.
当然  我可能还燃烧了一些卡路里
Sure I might've burned a few more calories
但实际上当我查看数据时
but actually when I look at the data
来自特定的冷却
that are coming from specific cooling
以及如何提高性能
and how that can so increase in performance
如果做得好  然后将其与效果进行比较
if done properly and then I compare that to the effects
服用某种产热化合物的方法  无论它是什么
of taking some sort of thermogenic compound, whatever it is
一些预先锻炼或一些药丸或高水平的咖啡因
some pre-workout or some pill or high levels of caffeine,
很明显  体温升高
it's very clear that increasing body temperature
锻炼之前是完全错误的事情
prior to working out is the exact wrong thing
那会想要做的
that one would want to do.
你不想这么冷
You don't want to stay so cold
不能产生良好的肌肉收缩
that you can't generate good muscle contractions.
你不想像我从寒冷的海洋中走出来
You don't want to be like I am coming out of the cold ocean,
手脚蜷缩
you know, with claws for hands
但有人想让你的体温保持在一定范围内
but one wants to have your body temperature in a range
仍然可以让你努力工作并表现良好
that still allows you to work hard and perform well.
那么  在恢复方面  如酒精
Now, in terms of recovery, things like alcohol,
我们知道我们的血管扩张药
we know our vasodilator.
因此  这些将导致人们降低体温
So those are going to cause people to drop body temperature.
所以你可能会想  哦  听起来不错  很容易恢复
So you might think, oh, well that sounds great for recovery
而且我不认为人们应该喝那些
and I don't think people should be drinking who are
酒精摄入有问题
you know, have problems with alcohol intake,
酗酒者
you know, alcoholics
或者他们还没到喝酒的年龄  等等
or they're not of drinking age, et cetera.
我不是酒徒  但我有一个好朋友
I'm not a drinker, but I do have a good friend
他是一个非常有成就的运动员
who's a quite accomplished athlete
基本上喝一两杯啤酒的人
who basically drinks a beer or two
在他长跑或骑自行车之后   他的论点
after his long runs or cycling and you know, his argument
很好  我正在倾泻体内的热量  我喜欢啤酒
is well, I'm dumping body heat and I like a beer
他可能是对的  这可能是一个非常好的工具
and he's probably right, it's probably a really good tool
如果你没有饮酒问题
provided you don't have issues with alcohol
那会排除它作为一种工具
that would preclude that as a tool
或你还没到喝酒的年龄
or you're not of drinking age.
但是运动后摄取的任何东西
But anything that you ingest after exercise
那会增加体温
that would increase body temperature
将阻碍复苏
is going to impede recovery.
你所做的任何降低体温的事情
Anything that you do that lowers body temperature
提供它在安全范围内
provides it's in safe ranges
将加速恢复
is going to accelerate recovery.
这将我们带入了整个化合物领域
And that brings us to the whole host of compounds
人们服用会增加体温
that people take that can increase body temperature.
许多人正在服用这些东西
And many people are taking these things
为了增加脂肪燃烧和增加新陈代谢
in order to increase fat burning and increase metabolism
但我认为
but in my opinion
这阻碍了他们表现良好的能力
it's impeding their ability to perform well.
特别是如果表现
And especially if the performance
是你专注的东西
is something that you're focused on
除了身体重组外  还会失去建设肌肉的脂肪
aside from body recomposition, losing fat building muscle.
但是  即使你专注于减肥  也可以锻炼肌肉
But even if you're focused on losing fat, building muscle
你必须问自己  这样的体温升高
you have to ask yourself, is the body temperature increase
我从这些化合物中得到的体温升高  是值得的
that I'm getting from these compounds really worth it
因为它会阻止或阻碍我的更好的表现
given that it can block or prevent my performance from being as good as it could?
换句话说  值得带些东西吗
In other words, is it worth taking something
这使你感到非常有精力去锻炼
that makes you feel very energized to go work out
但是现在你知道你要早一点停下来
but then you now know that you are stopping earlier
而且你的表现不佳  重复次数较少
and you're performing less well, fewer reps,
总体上减少了步骤  这值得吗？
fewer steps overall, is it worth it?
如果你没有拿那东西
If you had not taken that thing
那你可以运动更长的时间
then you could perform much longer
并具有更高的能力
and at much higher capacity.
你们当中有些人可能会说  这太荒谬了
Some of you are probably saying, well, that's ridiculous
因为当我喝四倍浓缩咖啡时
because when I drink a quadruple espresso
我会进行任何锻炼前的锻炼或喝锻炼前的锻炼
and I pop a whatever pre-workout or drink a pre-workout
那我知道我可以走得更远
then I know I can go much further.
嗯  这可能是正确的  但是温度升高
Ah, that might be true but the increase in temperature
在恢复方面也使你付出了代价
is also costing you on the recovery side.
除非你在做其他事情
And unless you're doing other things
为了改善你的康复能力  我知道很多人
to improve your recovery and I know many people that are,
我不判断  但是很多人在做那些事
I don't judge but many people who are doing those things
也正在增加他们的康复
are also augmenting their recovery
通过激素增加
through hormone augmentation
和其他性能增强工具
and other performance enhancing tools,
然后对于不这样做的普通人
then for the typical person who's not doing that
可能是在搬起石头砸自己的脚
it's probably shooting yourself in the foot.
因此  让我们看一下其中一些化合物是什么
So let's take a look at what some of those compounds are
以及他们的内容  并简要回顾一下
and what they and just briefly review
包括它们是否是一个好主意还是一个坏主意
whether or not they would be a good or a bad idea to include
如果你的主要目标是运动表现
if your main goals are performance
或你的主要目标是身体重构  或两者兼而有之
or your main goals are body recomposition or both.
因此  让我们简短地讨论兴奋剂
So let's just briefly discuss stimulants.
这可能是咖啡因
This could be caffeine,
这可能是任何其他刺激物
this could be any other kind of stimulant
通常在锻炼前喝
that are typically in a pre-workout drink
或任何可能使你在运动前恢复活力的事物
or anything that might get you revved up before exercising.
这甚至可以是很浓的茶
This could even be very strong tea,
我已经提到我是马黛茶的头号消费者
I've mentioned I'm a big consumer of mate.
我喜欢一个yerba马黛茶  我喜欢那个东西
I like a yerba mate, I love that stuff
我也喝咖啡因
and I also drink caffeine.
我喝各种各样的咖啡
I drink love coffee of various kinds
蘑菇咖啡  黑咖啡  浓缩咖啡等
mushroom coffee, black coffee, espresso, et cetera.
我是长期服用咖啡因的人  我不认为自己是瘾君子
I'm a chronic caffeine user, I don't think I'm an addict
但我是长期的咖啡因使用者
but I'm a chronic caffeine user.
意思是我喝咖啡因的时候
Meaning when I drink caffeine
我的心率没有增加太多
my heart rate doesn't increase so much
对我的身体没有特别大的感觉
that it feels like a shock to my system.
有些人不适应咖啡因
Some people are not caffeine adapted
或者它们对咖啡因非常敏感
or they're very caffeine sensitive.
这是简单明了的规则
Here's the straightforward rule.
对于不太喝咖啡因的人的咖啡因
Caffeine for somebody who doesn't drink caffeine very much
会收缩血管
will constrict the blood vessels
并会增加体内热量的保留
and will increase retention of body heat
运动前这可能是个坏主意
and it's probably a bad idea before exercise.
对于咖啡因适应的人
For somebody who's caffeine adapted
习惯喝咖啡因
and is used to drinking caffeine,
它不会有血管收缩作用
it won't have that vasoconstriction effect,
这也是数据指向的原因  因为我适应了它
that's what the data point too, because I'm adapted to it
但是会引起血管扩张
but it will cause vasodilation
并让我排出体内的热量
and will allow me to dump body heat.
所以对我来说  我在训练之前就使用它
So for me, I use it before I train
或做任何运动
or do any kind of exercise
因为我倾向于在一天的早些时候这样做
because I tend to do that early in the day,
不会阻止我入睡
it won't prevent me from sleeping
并引起血管扩张
and it causes vasodilation.
然后我知道
And then afterwards I'm aware
引起血管收缩
that it causes vasoconstriction
咖啡因耗尽后
after the caffeine wears off.
所以对于喝两三杯的人
So for somebody who drinks two or three
每天或每天多杯咖啡或马黛茶
or more cups of coffee a day or mate a day,
所以我们说的是摄入量
so we're talking intake
一百到四百毫克的咖啡因
of anywhere from a hundred to 400 milligrams of caffeine,
你想做的就是要确保
what you want to do is you want to make sure
你会在运动前喝
that you would do that before exercise
而不是运动后
and probably not after exercise,
不仅合乎逻辑
not just makes logical sense
鉴于我们对热调节的了解
given what we know about thermal regulation.
如果你是不喝咖啡因的人
And if you're somebody who doesn't drink caffeine,
锻炼前喝咖啡因
drinking caffeine before a workout
将会是最坏的事情
is going to be about the worst thing
你可能会做
that you could possibly do
因为这会增加核心体温
because it's going to increase core body temperature
通过其生热作用
through its thermogenic effects
会收缩你的血管
and it's going to constrict your blood vessels
并使热量散发变得更加困难
and make it even harder to dump heat.
所以我不建议人们喝咖啡因或不喝咖啡因
So I don't suggest that people drink caffeine or not,
我只是建议你考虑一下
I just suggest that you think about
无论你的咖啡因是否适应
whether or not your caffeine adapted or not,
并决定是否要喝咖啡因
and decide whether or not you want to drink caffeine.
一般来说  最好不要喝任何咖啡因
In general, you're going to be better not drinking any caffeine
比你喝咖啡因
than you are drinking caffeine
除非你是大量的咖啡因使用者或滥用者
unless you're a heavy caffeine user or abuser.
在这种情况下不喝咖啡因
In which case not drinking caffeine
会给你带来恶性头痛
is going to give you vicious headaches
并会变得很难上进
and is going to make it very hard to get motivated
因为你只是不习惯
because you're just not used to it.
不习惯使用咖啡因大约需要三个星期
It takes about three weeks to get used to no caffeine.
这太残酷了  我以前做过  我做过咖啡因戒断
It's brutal, I've done it before, I've done caffeine fast,
我不知道我想再做一次
I don't know that I ever want to do it again,
那是多么痛苦
that's how painful it was.
但是你会头疼
But you get headaches
因为对血管舒张和收缩有影响
because of the effects on vasodilation and constriction.
如果你喜欢适量使用咖啡因
If you like caffeine use in moderate amounts
在运动前使用  而不是之后
and use it before your not after.
如果你不喜欢咖啡因或不经常使用咖啡因
If you don't like caffeine or you don't use it very often,
运动前后
stay away from it anywhere close to exercise
都尽量不要摄入咖啡因
before or after for that matter.
一种较常用的化合物
One of the more commonly used compounds
那是在柜台上卖的
that's sold over the counter
是非类固醇消炎药
are non-steroid anti-inflammatories
像泰诺（Tylenol）和阿德维尔（Advil）等商标名称
so things like Tylenol and Advil and other trade names
和那种奈普罗辛钠的东西
and Neproxin sodium things of that sort,
几乎所有这些都会在一定程度上降低体温
almost all of those drop body temperature to some extent.
这就是为什么它经常被推荐
And that's why it's often recommended
人们发烧时服用
that people take them when they have a fever
虽然整个商业环境
although the whole business
发烧时  去人为地降低体温
of dropping body temperature artificially
本身就是一个有趣的讨论
when you have a fever is itself an interesting discussion
这是最有适应性还是最好的事情
whether or not that's the most adaptive or best thing to do
当然  你不希望发烧过高
certainly you don't want fever to go too high,
可能很危险  可以杀死你
can be very dangerous, can kill you
但是人为地降低体温
but artificially dropping body temperature
用这些化合物可能会很棘手
with these compounds can be tricky.
那么  许多运动员  尤其是耐力运动员
Now, a number of athletes especially endurance athletes
将依靠这些非类固醇消炎药
will rely on these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
专门用来降低体温
specifically to keep body temperature lower
在长时间的运动中
during long bouts of exertion.
这是一些药理学版本的放热
This is a little bit of a pharmacologic version
而不是使用“手掌”冷却
of dumping heat instead of using palmer cooling
或者 脸部冰袋冷却
or you know, face ice pack cooling,
他们依靠药理学
they're relying on pharmacology
降低他们的核心体温
to drop their core body temperature.
那有一定的明显优势
That has certain obvious advantages,
这些优势应该很明显
those advantages should be obvious
而且它们的原因应该很明显
and the reasons for them should be obvious
根据我们到目前为止所讨论的一切
based on everything we've talked about up until now
较低的温度可以使你更加努力
lower temperature allows you to go further harder
强度更高
with more intensity.
但是  它们确实对肝脏有影响
However, they do have effects on the liver
它们也可能对肾脏有影响
and they can also have effects on the kidneys
在长时间的运动中
and during long bouts of exercise
甚至是短暂的运动
or even short bouts of exercise,
水平衡和盐分平衡也将至关重要
water balance and salt balance are also going to be vital
为了保持良好的表现
to maintain in order to perform well,
产生最佳的肌肉收缩  保持精神警觉
generate the best muscle contraction, stay mentally alert
而且还要保证活着
and also to stay alive.
我们将播放有关盐电解质和水的平衡 的播客
We will do an episode on salt electrolytes and water
但你可能要仔细考虑
and water balance but you probably want to think carefully
关于是否
about whether or not
你想使用非甾体类抗炎药
you want to use non-steroid anti-inflammatories
在任何训练之前
before any training session
只是为了提高性能
just for the performance augmentation effect
除非你与教练认真合作
unless you're working carefully with a coach
你是否在实践中做到了
whether or not you've done that in practices
当然  无论你是否处于困境
and of course, whether or not you are in a situation
仔细监测体温的地方
where monitoring your body temperature carefully
将会很重要
is going to be important.
你可能会问  那会是什么时候？
You might ask, well, when would that be?
好吧  沙漠比赛  夏季训练和比赛  冬季骑行
Well, desert races, summer training and races, winter rides,
你当然也不想变得太冷
you certainly don't want to get too cool either.
所以酒精  咖啡因和非甾体类抗炎药
So alcohol, caffeine and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
因为它们对温度有影响
because of their effects on temperature
将影响性能和恢复
will impact performance and recovery
但是你要谨慎对待他们
but you want to be cautious about how you approach them.
我个人更喜欢使用咖啡因
I personally am more a fan of using caffeine
由于我之前描述的原因  以中等剂量服用
in moderate doses for the reasons I described before
以及利用手掌的冷却
as well to use the cooling of the palms,
脚底的凉爽  对
cooling of the bottoms of my feet, right,
通过将它们放入水桶或冷水浴中
by placing them into a bucket or into a cool bath
训练后或训练后冷却脸
after training or cooling the face after training
甚至有时甚至在训练过程中
or sometimes even during training.
似乎还有更多的余地
It just seems like there's more of a margin
发挥变量  加热水
to play with the variables, to heat up the water
或将其冷却一点  以包括一只手掌
or cool it down a little bit to include one palm
或另一只手掌
or the other palm.
有各种各样的好参数空间
There's all sorts of good parameter space
正如我们在科学中所说的那样  你可以玩弄
as we call it in science that you can play with
并找到适合你的方法
and work with to find what works for you
而当你弹出药丸时  请确保你可以调整剂量
whereas when you pop a pill, sure you can adjust the dose
你下次可以调整
and you can adjust it next time
但是一旦在你里面  就在你里面
but once it's in you, it's in you
会有一段时间
and there's going to be some period of time
在你对其进行调制之前
before you can modulate it.
我今天提供的
What I've offered today
是你可以使用温度的方法
are ways in which you can use temperature
以有力地提高身体性能
to powerfully improve performance.
如果你考虑一下
And if you think about it,
你可以根据不同情况进行设置
you can vary that from set to set,
你可以做你的引体向上或冲刺
you could do your pull ups or your sprints
然后冷却你的手掌
and then cool your palms,
然后尝试用冷水去下一轮
and then try and go with colder water the next round
或下一轮温水
or warmer water the next round
或双脚  手掌和脸都做
or do both feet and palms and face.
我的意思是  你可以随时做各种各样的事情
I mean, you can do all sorts of things moment to moment
再看看什么对你有用
and see what works for you again
基本上为零成本或无成本
essentially zero cost or no cost.
而当你服用某物时  比如你服用一粒药
Whereas when you pop something, you take a pill,
你基本上就进入了一个疗程中
you're basically in that regimen
接下来的一两个小时或更长时间
for the next hour or two or more.
你总可以多服用  但无法做到少服用
You can always take more, but you can't really take less.
你无法真正从身体中实时提取它
You can't really extract it from your body in real time
所以不会给你很多机会
so it doesn't give you a lot of opportunity
扮演科学家  这是我喜欢做的
to play scientists, which is what I like to do
因为我一直在努力做
because what I'm always trying to do
正在尝试找到最好的工具方法
is trying to dial in the best protocols possible
基于机制和数据
based on the mechanisms and data.
如果你能做到这一点
And if you can do that moment to moment
使你处于有力的位置
that places you in a position of power.
再次  我们涵盖了很多材料
Once again, we covered a lot of material.
到现在为止  看到这集之后
By now, after seeing this episode
或听这个播客  你应该了解很多
or listening to this episode, you should understand a lot
关于你的身体如何加热和冷却自己
about how your body heats and cools itself
以及体能的价值
and the value of that for physical performance.
我希望你也会感激
I hope you'll also appreciate
你拥有可供使用的工具
that you have tools at your disposal
大大改善你的体能
to vastly improve your physical performance.
如果你要尝试这些  请告诉我们进展如何
And should you try those, please let us know how it goes.
如果你决定在跑步过程中进行手掌冷却
If you decide to do palmer cooling during your runs
或跑步后  在进行重量锻炼时
or after your runs, during your weight workouts,
在瑜伽课上  不管是什么  让我们知道
during your yoga sessions, whatever it is, let us know,
请把它放在评论中
please place that in the comments.
我给你具体的工具方法和一些方向
I've given you specific protocols and some direction,
但我也略微含糊
but I've also left it slightly vague
因为它  正如我之前提到的
because it, as I mentioned earlier
我不知道所有的环境条件
I don't know all the environmental conditions,
我不知道你的瑜伽馆有多热
I don't know how hot your yoga studio is
或是你的健身室多么酷
or how cool your gym happens to be
或你的体温或一天中的时间
or your body temperature or time of day.
记住你的温度会变化
Remember your temperature will vary
根据一天中的时间
according to the time of day,
我们做了整整一集关于睡眠的事
we did a whole episode about that related to sleep.
通常  你的体温在一天中的早些时候就会升高
Typically your body temperature is rising early in the day
傍晚时分下来
and is coming down as you approach the late evening
和深夜睡觉  在深夜
and late night hours for sleep, in the middle of the night
你的温度很低
your temperature is very low
绝对最低
at its absolute lowest
我们称之为最低温度
something we call the temperature minimum.
因此  我们不知道你确切的位置
So we don't know exactly where you're at.
你需要获取今天收到的信息
You need to take the information that you receive today
你应该尝试并将其融合进入你的生活
and should you try and incorporate it
尝试并聪明地做到这一点
try and do it intelligently.
不要让自己过分冷却 以至于你感觉
Don't cool yourself off so much that you know
变得低温  请不要加热自己
become cryogenic and please don't warm yourself up.
实际上  我们根本没有谈论过为加热
In fact, we didn't talk at all about warming yourself up
因为过多地温度升高可能会很危险
because warming yourself up too much can be quite dangerous.
你永远也不想做体温过低的人
You never, ever, ever want to be hypothermic,
那就是你的身体和大脑要避免的东西
that's what your body and your brain are trying to avoid.
我们谈论了一些关于补品的话题
We talked a little bit about supplements
但不是标准的补品
but not the standard sorts of supplements
我通常会列出这些播客
I usually list off on these episodes.
相反  我们谈论咖啡因
Rather, we talked about caffeine,
非甾体类抗炎药
non-steroid anti-inflammatories
以及它们如何影响温度
and how those can impact temperature,
酒精如何影响温度
how alcohol can impact temperature.
最后我要提一下
And I should just mention in closing
每次我们进食时  我们的体温也会升高
that every time we eat, we also increased temperature.
有进食引起的生热作用
There's a eating induced thermogenic effect
但这是次要的  那是一个很小的
but that's a minor one, that's a small one.
这样你就不必担心训练前进食
So you wouldn't worry about eating before training
因为它对温度有影响
because of its effects on temperature
因为它往往确实很小
because it tends to be really minor.
展望未来  我们将更多地讨论温度
Going forward, we're going to talk more about temperature
和其他改善体能的方法
and other ways to improve physical performance
和技能学习
and skill learning.
我们将讨论具体方法
We're going to talk about specific ways
加速脂肪流失  改善肌肉生长
to accelerate fat loss, to improve muscle growth,
改善柔韧性和灵活度
to improve suppleness and flexibility.
这些方法和机制深深扎根
These approaches and mechanisms are anchored deeply
在神经科学和生理学及其关系
in neuroscience and physiology and the relationship
在我们周围的器官之间  包括我们的皮肤
between our peripheral organs, which include our skin
以及我们的大脑和介于两者之间的所有器官
and our brain and all the organs in between.
所以对我来说真的很高兴  因为我能够看
So it's really a pleasure for me because I'm able to look
到现有的教科书文献
to the textbook literature that exists
并在过去50到100年的时间内真正问世
and really came out over the last 50 to a hundred years
与神经科学的许多领域不同
and unlike a lot of areas of neuroscience
仍然有些神秘
which are still sort of mystical,
比如意识和梦想
like consciousness and dreaming,
我们有点了解
of which we understand a little bit
关于温度和生理的这些核心机制
about these core mechanisms of temperature and physiology
如此强大  涉及非常具体的研究
which are so powerful, involve very concrete studies
就像你今天所学到的那样  是非常可行的
that as you learn today are very actionable.

Today we didn't focus so heavily on supplements,
但在其他播客中
but in other episodes I have,
而且肯定有补品
and there are certainly supplements
对睡眠有益的
that are beneficial for sleep,
为了表现  为了学习
for performance, for learning,
免疫力等等
immunity and so forth.
我们已经与Thorne  THORNE.com合作
We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com,
因为索恩补充
because Thorne supplements
我们相信是最严格的
we believe to be the most stringent

in terms of what they put on the bottle
实际上是瓶子里的东西  所以数量是精确的
is actually what's in the bottle, so the amounts are precise
成分的质量非常精确
and the quality of the ingredients is very precise.
他们与梅奥诊所合作
They partner with the Mayo Clinic,
所有主要的运动队
