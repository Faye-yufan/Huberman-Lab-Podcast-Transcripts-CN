欢迎来到Huberman Lab播客
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
我们在这里讨论科学
where we discuss science
和用于日常生活的基于科学的工具
and science-based tools for everyday life.
我是Andrew Huberman
I'm Andrew Huberman,
我是神经生物学和眼科教授
and I'm a professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
在斯坦福医学院
at Stanford School of Medicine.
此播客是单独的
This podcast is separate
从我在斯坦福大学的教学和研究职位中得出
from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
但是 这是我渴望和努力的一部分
It is however, part of my desire and effort
为消费者提供有关科学的零成本信息
to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
以及面向大众的与科学相关的工具
and science-related tools to the general public.
为了与该主题保持一致
In keeping with that theme,
我要感谢今天播客的赞助商
I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
我们的第一个赞助商是InsideTracker
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
InsideTracker是一个个性化的营养平台
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
分析你的血液和DNA的数据
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
帮助你更好地了解自己的身体
to help you better understand your body
并帮助你实现健康目标
and help you reach your health goals.
我一直热衷于完成血液工作
I've long been a fan of getting blood work done.
原因很简单
And the simple reason for that,
是你想知道的大多数事情
is that most of the things that you want to know
关于你的健康的信息 例如激素 代谢因子
about your health, such as hormones, metabolic factors,
血糖水平等等
blood sugar levels, et cetera,
只能从血液中进行分析
can only be analyzed from blood.
如今 也有出色的DNA测试
And nowadays there are also excellent DNA tests
也可以为你提供有价值的信息
that can also give you valuable information
关于细胞里发生的事情 分子
about what's going on at the cellar, molecular,
甚至是大脑和身体内的神经回路水平
even the neural circuit level within your brain and body.
InsideTracker使血液和DNA测试变得容易
InsideTracker makes getting blood and DNA tests easy.
你可以去一个测试现场 他们在这里抽血
You can go to a testing site where they draw your blood,
他们会提取你的DNA样本
they take your DNA sample,
或者 如果你愿意 他们可以来你家
or they can come to your home if you prefer that.
同样 它们还有一个非常了不起的仪表板
As well, they have a really amazing dashboard.
仪表板让你了解
The dashboard lets you understand
你各种激素的水平
what your levels of various hormones
和代谢因子等的平均值
and metabolic factors et cetera mean,
以及你应该如何处理它们
and what you should do about them.
我认为这是主要的事情之一
And I think that's one of the main things
真正将InsideTracker分开
that really separates InsideTracker
除了其他血液和DNA测试
apart from other blood and DNA tests.
大多数测试可以让你获得结果
Most tests you get the results back,
但没有关于具体操作的指令
but there are no directives about what to do specifically
为了使数字进入范围
in order to bring the numbers into the ranges
你想要实现的目标
that you would like for your goals.
InsideTracker使所有这些变得非常简单
InsideTracker makes all of that extremely simple
而且非常清楚
and extremely clear.

今天的一集也由运动绿色带给我们
Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
运动果岭是多合一的
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
维生素 矿物质益生菌饮料
vitamin, mineral probiotic drink.
我从2012年开始服用运动果岭
I started taking Athletic Greens back in 2012
从那以后我就接受了
and I've taken it ever since.
因此 我很高兴他们赞助播客
So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
我开始服用运动果岭的原因
The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
以及我现在仍然接受的原因
and the reason I still take it now,
是运动果岭
is that Athletic Greens
真的让我涵盖了我所有的营养基础
really lets me cover all my nutritional basis
在维生素 矿物质和益生菌方面
in terms of vitamins, minerals and probiotics.
现在有很多数据
There's so much data now
指向肠道微生物组这一事实
pointing to the fact that the gut microbiome
肠脑轴对新陈代谢很重要
and the gut brain axis is important for metabolism
为了内分泌健康
and for endocrine health.
运动绿色中的维生素 矿物质和益生菌
The vitamins, minerals and probiotics in Athletic Greens
让我充满信心 因为我覆盖了我的所有基地
make me feel confident that I'm covering all my bases.
我确实服用其他补品 但搭配运动果岭
I do take other supplements, but with Athletic Greens
我知道我已经处理了所有基本内容
I know that I've got all the foundational stuff handled.
它的味道也很好
It also tastes really good.
本身味道不错
Tastes fine on its own,
你可以把它和水混合 这就是我要做的
you can mix it with water, which is what I do.
我加一点柠檬汁或酸橙汁
I add a little bit of lemon juice or lime juice,
因为我也喜欢那里的酸味
because I like a little tartness flavor in there as well,
但大多数人只是将它与水混合
but most people just mix it with water,
它超级容易混合
it mixes up super easily.
我每天喝一两次
I drink it once or twice a day.
通常是凌晨一次 下午又一次
Usually once mid morning, and once again in the afternoon.
如果你想尝试运动绿色
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
你可以访问sportsgreens.com/huberman
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
如果你这样做 可以索取他们的特别优惠
And if you do that, you can claim their special offer
这是一年中维生素D3K2的供应
which is a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
现在有大量证据表明维生素D3
There is now a ton of evidence that vitamin D3
参与了无数的代谢过程
is involved in countless metabolic processes,
重要的荷尔蒙过程
hormonal processes that are important
为整体健康和福祉
for overall health and wellbeing.
维生素D3 你当然可以从阳光中获取
Vitamin D3, you can get from the sun of course,
但是大多数人都缺乏维生素D3
but most people are deficient in vitamin D3.
因此 如果你转到sportsgreens.com/huberman
So if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
你会得到运动果岭的
you'll get the Athletic Greens,
你将获得一年中维生素D3和K2的供应量
you'll get the year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2
你将获得五个免费的旅行套票
and you'll get five free travel packs.
再次是sportsgreens.com/huberman
So once again it's athleticgreens.com/huberman,
获得运动果岭 维生素D3K2
to get Athletic Greens, the vitamin D3K2,
一年的供应加上五个免费旅行包
and that's a year supply plus the five free travel packs.
今天的一集也由Munk Pack带给我们
Today's episode is also brought to us by Munk Pack.
Munk Pack是一家生产可食用酮类小吃的公司
Munk Pack is a company that makes keto-friendly snacks
味道令人难以置信
that taste incredible
但只有一克或更少的糖
but have just one gram of sugar or less.
实际上 它们的味道令人难以置信
And indeed they taste incredible.
实际上 我的生产团队在Huberman Lab Podcast上
In fact, my production team here at the Huberman Lab Podcast
取笑我 因为我实际上必须让这些盒子
teases me because I actually have to keep the boxes
放在我的地下室中
of Munk Pack bars in my basement
因为否则我会偷吃掉所有这些
'cause otherwise I'll tear through all of them.
我记得我第一次品尝它的时候
I remember the first time I tasted it, I was like,
好吧 我们开始吧  试试看  什么是酮棒
all right, here we go, a keto bar.
我一般不喜欢坚果棒
I'm not a big fan of bars in general,
他们中的大多数对我不好
most of them don't taste good to me.
我尝过了Munk Pack的坚果棒
And I tasted the Munk Pack bars,
他们绝对很棒
and they are absolutely awesome.
他们有很多不同的口味
They come in a lot of different flavors.
我偏爱焦糖海盐之一
I'm partial to the caramel sea salt one,
但他们也有海盐黑巧克力
but they also have sea salt dark chocolate,
花生酱黑巧克力
peanut butter dark chocolate.
他们有很多口味
They have a bunch of flavors.
它们都是不可思议的 我已经尝试了所有
They're all incredible, I've tried them all.
这就是为什么我把它们放在地下室
Which is why I keep them in my basement.
正如我之前在此播客中提到的那样
As I mentioned previously on this podcast,
我既不是酮 也不是碳
I'm neither keto nor carbo.
从这个意义上说 我并不是很特别地节食
I don't really follow a particular diet in that sense.
我的饮食方式可以最大程度地提高我的警觉性
I eat in a way that maximizes my alertness
以及当我想工作的那天我的专注程度
and my levels of focus during the day when I want to work,
而这使我最大程度地过渡到晚上入睡
and that maximize my transition to sleep at night.
所以 我白天基本上吃低碳水化合物的酮菜
So, I basically eat low carb keto-ish during the day.
而且我知道生酮爱好者们会说我不是生酮
And I know the ketonistas will say that I'm not in ketosis
而且我可以设法进入酮症
and I can manage to get into ketosis.
但主要思想是
But the main idea,
是我白天保持低碳水化合物吗？
is I keep my carbohydrates low during the day.
然后在晚上我吃碳水化合物
And then at night I do eat carbohydrates.
所以对我来说 Munk Pack坚果棒是非常不错的小吃
So for me, the Munk Pack bars are a really good snack
通常在下午 喝杯咖啡
usually in the afternoon, with a cup of coffee,
特别是在那之后我要去训练的时候
especially if I'm going to train soon after that,
或者如果我只是想吃点零食 我将继续工作
or if I just want to snack and I'm going to continue working.
正如我之前提到的 它们绝对美味
As I mentioned before, they are absolutely delicious.
他们也没有任何对你不利的东西
They also don't have any of the stuff that's bad for you.
没有大豆 反式脂肪 糖 酒精 人造色素
No soy, trans fat, sugar, alcohols, artificial colors,
我们应该避免的所有这些东西
all that stuff that we know we should avoid.

这个月 我们谈论激素
This month, we're talking all about hormones.
激素太不可思议了
Hormones are incredible
它们控制着大脑和身体的许多过程
and they control so many processes in the brain and body.
上一集 我们谈到了
Last episode, we talked about
雌激素和睾丸激素的作用
the role of estrogen and testosterone.
今天我们要谈的是
Today we're going to talk about
激素如何影响进食和饥饿
how hormones impact feeding and hunger,
以及饱腹感 你不想吃的感觉
as well as satiety, the feeling that you don't want to eat
或你已经吃饱了
or that you've eaten enough.
那么  重要的是要了解
Now, it's important to understand
在这种情况下 荷尔蒙不能单独起作用
that hormones don't work alone in this context.
今天我要讲一些激素
Today I'm going to describe some hormones
具有强大的作用
that have powerful effects
能决定你是否想吃更多或更少
on whether or not you want to eat more or less
或完全停止进食
or stop eating altogether.
但是它们不是自己做的
But they don't do that on their own,
他们与神经系统合作做到这一点
they do that in cooperation with the nervous system.
所以今天我会说很多
So today, I would say as much
甚至比其他任何播客都多
or perhaps even more than any other episodes,
我们将听到很多生物学
we're going to hear a lot of biology
但是我要说到多个“入口点”
but there are multiple what I'm going to call entry points
适用于你可以使用的工具
for tools that you can apply
为了调节你的饥饿程度
in order to regulate your levels of hunger,
你的用餐时间 饱腹感
your meal timing, your levels of satiety
不想多吃
of not wanting to eat more.
而且其中许多行为都是可行的
And many of this is actionable with behaviors,
但是 当然 我们还将讨论补品
but of course, we're also going to talk about supplements
我们实际上将要谈论
and we're actually going to talk about
一点脑机接口设备
a little bit of brain machine interface devices
实际上可以参与其中
that can actually be involved
处理这些不可思议的事情
in manipulating these incredible things
我们认为这是饥饿 食欲和饱腹感
that we think of as hunger and appetite and satiety.
因此 你需要了解的第一件事
So, the first thing that you need to know
关于神经系统方面
about the nervous system side,
神经控制 过度进食和饥饿
the neural control, over-feeding and hunger,
是你的大脑区域
is that there's an area of your brain
称为下丘脑
called the hypothalamus.
在前脑
It's in the forebrain,
告诉你它在你的大脑前面
which tells you it's in the front of your brain,
它在前脑的底部
and it's at the base of the forebrain.
那么  下丘脑包含
Now, the hypothalamus contains
许多不同种类的神经元
lots of different kinds of neurons
做很多不同的事情
doing lots of different kinds of things.
下丘脑中有神经元
There are neurons in your hypothalamus
控制性行为 控制体温
controlling sexual behavior, controlling body temperature,
控制昼夜节律
controlling circadian rhythms,
渴望睡觉或清醒
the desire to sleep or be awake.
甚至神经元控制愤怒
Even neurons controlling rage.
实际上有神经元 如果我们要刺激它们
There are actually neurons that if we were to stimulate them
会让你或任何人大发雷霆
would send you or anyone into a rage.
它们只是强大的控制中心
They're just powerful control centers
为大脑和身体
for the brain and body.
下丘脑有特定区域
There's a particular area of the hypothalamus
称为腹膜下丘脑
called the ventromedial hypothalamus.
这是研究人员感兴趣的一种
And it's one that researchers have been interested
长期以来 大家都对
for a long time now, in terms of its relationship
它与饥饿和进食的关系感兴趣
to hunger and feeding.
原因是 它造成了这些矛盾的影响
And the reason is, it creates these paradoxical effects.
那是什么意思
What do I mean by that?
他们发现有时候  一些器官损伤
What they found was that sometimes lesioning,
或破坏下丘脑腹侧神经元
or disrupting the neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus
会使动物或人暴食
would make animals or people hyperphasia,
他们想吃想到疯了
they would want to eat crazy.
其他个体或动物的其他病变
And other lesions in other individuals or animals
会使他们厌食
would make them anorexic,
这将使他们根本不想吃东西
it would make them not want to eat at all.
它将使食物令人反感
It would make food aversive.
这样就意味着腹侧下丘脑
So that means that the ventromedial hypothalamus
绝对是一个有趣的控制站
is definitely an interesting control station
控制着饥饿 饱食和饱食
for hunger and feeding and satiety,
但这并不能真正告诉你发生了什么
but it doesn't really tell you what's going on
在更深层次上
at a deeper level.
实际上 这有点令人困惑或自相矛盾
In fact, it's a little bit confusing or paradoxical.
原来有很多那里的神经元
It turns out that there are multiple populations
我们将讨论这些
of neurons in there, we're going to talk about those.
有些促进进食
Some are promoting feeding,
有的抑制吃饭的欲望  或不吃东西
and some are promoting not feeding or not eating.
那么  所有这一切的另一个神经成分
Now, the other neural component of all this
你需要了解的
that you need to know about,
实际上与你的嘴有关
actually has to do with your mouth.
所以你的皮质有一个区域
So there's an area of your cortex,
所以这在你的大脑中更远一些
so that's a little bit further up in your brain,
称为岛皮质
called the insular cortex.
并且它处理许多不同种类的信息
And it processes a lot of different kinds of information.
主要是关于你内在发生的事情的信息
Mostly information about what's going on inside you,
所谓的互感
so called the interoception.
岛状皮层有神经元
The insular cortex has neurons
从你的嘴里得到输入
that get input from your mouth,
从你嘴里的触觉感受器
from the touch receptors in your mouth.
岛状皮层具有强大的控制能力
And insular cortex has powerful control
你是否在享受所吃的东西
over whether or not you're enjoying what you're eating,
你是否要避免吃什么
whether or not you want to avoid what you're eating,
你是否受够了
whether or not you had enough,
或者你是否要继续吃更多东西
or whether or not you want to continue eating more.
无论信不信 这都必须要做
And that has to do, believe it or not,
带有进食的感觉或感觉
with the touch or sensation of eating.
我对此非常熟悉
I'm very familiar with this.
我是这些人中的一员 我喜欢吃很多东西
I'm one of these people, I love eating so much,
我就是喜欢咀嚼这个动作
that I just like the mere act of chewing.
你知道 我足够喜欢芹菜杆
You know, I like celery sticks enough.
我不为他们疯狂 但你知道他们对我来说很好吃
I'm not crazy about them, but you know they taste fine to me
我喜欢咀嚼芹菜棒
and I like chewing on celery sticks,
但我实际上只是喜欢咀嚼它们
but I actually just like chewing on them.
我可以整天吃
I could eat all day long
这样做不健康
except that it's not healthy to do that.
但是仅仅为我咀嚼的行为是非常愉快的
But the mere act of chewing for me is very pleasurable.
嚼口香糖的人也有这种感觉
People who chew gum feel this way as well.
就口香糖或咀嚼而言
And just as a point about gum or chewing,
如果你选择芹菜之类的东西
if you choose something like celery
或黄瓜片或口香糖
or cucumber slices or chew gum,
只要它不含有糖或热量
provided it doesn't have any sugar or caloric content,
它不会增加饥饿感
it's not going to drive increased hunger.
通常情况并非如此
That generally isn't the case.
但是 如果你吃含糖的东西 我们会发现
But if you eat something with sugar, as we'll find out,
它在岛状皮层中有非常特殊的作用
it has a very specific action in the insular cortex
以及神经系统的其他部位
and in other areas of your nervous system
促进了多吃的欲望
that promotes the desire to eat more.
但是现在的关键点
But the key point right now
就是知道你有两个大脑区域
is to know you've got these two brain areas,
腹侧下丘脑
the ventromedial hypothalamus,
与饥饿和饱腹感有关
that's involved in hunger and lack of hunger,
像是某种加速器和刹车
sort of an accelerator and a brake on feeding.
而且你有这个岛状皮层
And you have this insular cortex
从你的嘴里得到输入
that gets input from your mouth,
并且关心咀嚼和食物的稠度
and cares about chewing and the consistency of foods
还有各种各样有趣的事情
and all sorts of interesting things
那是非常有触觉的
that are just very tactile.
而且我认为大多数人都会想到触摸感应器
And I think most people think about the touch receptors on,
不好意思 舌头上的味觉感受器
excuse me, the taste receptors on the tongue.
但是我们常常不考虑
But we often don't think about
食物的触感或触觉精华
the touch or tactile essence of food.
而现在想到的是
And the thing that comes to mind just now
我吃过寿司好几次
is I've gone to sushi several times,
还有一些人真的很喜欢海胆
and some people really like the urchin.
我不喜欢海胆
I don't like the urchin.
它有某种让我无所适从的口感
There's something about it that kind of creeps me out
关于一致性 其他人会喜欢它
about the consistency, other people love it.
因此 它是高度个体化的 并且可能是有经验的
So it's highly individual and it's probably learned,
这可能有文化背景
and there's some probably cultural background to this
如果你长大后正在吃海胆
if you were raised eating urchin.
有些人喜欢这种一致性或接触感
Some people love that consistency or that touch.
所以触摸有很多事情要做
So touch has a lot to do
是否要吃东西
with whether or not you want to eat or not.
那么  让我们回到腹侧下丘脑
Now, let's get back to the ventromedial hypothalamus.
有时候 它会使动物或人们想吃更多的东西
Sometimes it makes animals or people want to eat more,
有时更少 那么那里发生了什么？
sometimes less, so what's going on there?
有一个经典的实验已经完成
There's a classic experiment that was done
研究人员取了两只老鼠
in which researchers took two rats,
并所谓的超生物杀虫剂彼此
and so-called parabiosed them to each other.
那意味着他们做了一点手术
What that meant is that they did a little surgery
他们联系了他们的血液供应
and they linked their blood supply
使它们永远彼此物理联系
so that they were forever physically linked to one another
并可以交换血液中的因子
and could exchange factors in the blood,
但他们的大脑是分开的 他们的嘴是分开的
but their brains were separate, their mouths were separate,
他们基本上是分开做所有的事情
and they essentially did everything separately
但是它们被链接在一起
except that they were linked to one another.
所以它们必须走在一起
So they had to walk together
然后去相同的地方去做
and go to the same places in order to do it.
这个共生实验
This parabiosis experiment
揭示了一些非常重要的东西
revealed something really important.
当他们病变腹侧下丘脑
When they lesioned the ventromedial hypothalamus
在与另一只老鼠相连的一只老鼠中
in one of the rats that was connected to the other rat,
那只老鼠变得非常非常肥胖 非常肥胖
that rat got very, very fat, just really obese,
巨大的老鼠 超级老鼠 巨型老鼠
huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat.
但是 另一个非常瘦
The other one however, got very thin,
还轻了一点
it actually lost weight,
尽管两者消耗的食物量
despite consuming the same amount of food that it had
与在另一只老鼠患病以前相同
prior to the other one getting the lesion.
那这告诉我们什么呢？
So what does this tell us?
告诉我们血液里有东西
This tells us that there's something in the blood
在两种动物之间进行交换
that's being exchanged between the two animals,
因为是他们的血液供应联系在一起
because it was their blood supply that was linked.
这告诉我们有激素或内分泌信号
And that tells us that there's hormone or endocrine signals
与进食的欲望有关
that are involved in the desire to eat,
以及饥饿和食欲
and hunger and appetite.
接下来 我们将讨论
And so next, we're going to talk about
这些内分泌信号是什么
what those endocrine signals are,
然后我要立即指出
and then I'm going to immediately point
一些你可以使用的入口点
to some entry points that you can use.
你可以用这些
And you can use these
即使你对任何事物都不感兴趣
even if you're not parabiosed to anything.
这样可以让你安排进餐时间
And that can allow you to time your meal frequency,
并预测你什么时候会饿
and predict when you're going to be hungry or not.
以及增进食欲
As well as a drive up appetite.
真的  生活中总是有人
Believe it or not, there are people out there
想要吃更多的东西
who are trying to eat more.
尽管我认为更多的人正在尝试少吃点东西
Although I think far many more people are trying to eat less
但是  数据只会指向事实
because nowadays, the data just point to the fact
本质上数据显示的是糖尿病的流行
that there is essentially an epidemic of diabetes,
II型糖尿病和肥胖
type II diabetes and obesity.
现在大多数人都同意
And most everyone agrees now,
保持健康的体重
that maintaining a healthy body weight
以及体重体脂组成
and body weight composition,
是长寿的最佳途径之一
is one of the best paths to longevity
而且让人感觉很好
and to just feeling very good
并真正能够思考
and actually being able to think.
认知功能
Cognitive functioning
实际上与脂肪组织的水平等等有关
is actually linked to levels of adipose tissue and so forth.
那么 让我们谈谈内分泌因素
So, let's talk about the endocrine factors
调节进食 饥饿和饱腹感的因素
that regulate feeding, hunger and satiety.
在过去20年的饮食和食欲科学中
One of the really exciting things to emerge
出现的真正令人兴奋的事情之一
in the science of feeding and appetite in the last 20 years,
是另一个大脑区域的发现
is the discovery of another brain area.
不只是腹侧下丘脑
And not just the ventromedial hypothalamus,
但这是称为弓形核的大脑区域
but it's an area of the brain called the arcuate nucleus.
和弓形核
And the arcuate nucleus
有一些非常令人着迷的神经元
has some really fascinating sets of neurons
会释放出更多不可思议的分子
that release even more incredible molecules
以及化学物质进入血液
and chemicals into the blood.
这些化学物质可作为促进剂
And these chemicals act as accelerators
进食和食欲 或休息
on feeding and appetite, or breaks.
真的很酷的是
And the really cool thing
是你实际上可以控制这些分子
is that you can actually control these molecules
通过简单的行为
through simple behaviors.
一旦你了解了这些分子是什么
And once you understand what these molecules are,
你将开始理解为什么会这样
you'll start to understand why that's the case.
以及你现在拥有的控制点
And the control points that you have right now
可以控制你的食欲
in order to control your appetite in either direction,
增加或减少都可以
increase or decrease.
因此 首先 有一组神经元
So, first of all, there are set of neurons
在这个称为PMOC神经元的弓形核中 好吧
in this arcuate nucleus called the PMOC neurons, okay?
我不想深入了解首字母缩写所代表的含义
I don't want to get into what the acronym stands for,
但我还是会说一下
but I'll do it anyway.
是Proopiomelanocortin系统 好吗？
It's the Proopiomelanocortin system, okay?
这些就是PMOC神经元Proopiomelanocortin
So these are PMOC neurons, Proopiomelanocortin.
如果你听到了melano 那应该告诉你
And if you heard melano, that should tell you
这与色素沉着有关
it has something to do with pigmentation
在皮肤细胞或毛细胞中 某种色素沉着
in skin cells or in hair cells, pigmentation of some sort,
因为黑色素
because of melanin.
最后一集 我聊了一点
Last episode, I talked a little bit
关于轻多巴胺和黑色素之间的关系
about the relationship between light dopamine and melanin.
所以你应该已经在想 等一下 melano意味着
So you should already be thinking, wait, melano means
它可能与该系统有关
it probably has something to do with that system,
确实如此
and indeed it does.
那么  POMC神经元产生了一种叫做Alpha MSH的东西
Now, the POMC neurons, make something called Alpha MSH.
黑色素细胞刺激激素
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
α-黑素细胞刺激激素
Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone.
如果你不想记住其他任何首字母缩写词
If you don't want to remember any of the other acronyms
到目前为止 我所谈论的术语和术语
and terms I've talked about, this episode so far,
尝试记住MSH 好吗？
do try and remember M-S-H, okay?
鼠标 山姆 仓鼠 MSH 好吗？
Mouse, Sam, Hamster, M-S-H, okay?
MSH降低食欲
MSH reduces appetite
这是一个强大的分子 好吗？
and it's a powerful molecule, all right?
所以回想一下
So just put that on the shelf,
MSH会降低食欲
MSH reduces appetite.
那么  还有另一群神经元
Now, there's another population of neurons
在弓形核中 称为AgRP神经元
in the arcuate nucleus, called the AgRP neurons.
而且我真的不会读给你什么意思
And there I'm truly not going to read you what that stands for
因为这与老鼠的压力有关
'cause it's related to the mouse strain
它最初是在
it was first identified in,
但是人类也有这些细胞    AgRP神经元
but humans have these cells as well, but AgRP neurons.
AgRP神经元刺激进食
The AgRP neurons stimulate eating.
每当你要吃东西的时候
And anytime you are approaching food,
或者你对食物或焦虑感到有些兴奋
or you feel some excitement about food or anxiety,
因为有些人真的会经历
because some people actually experience
一种加剧的焦虑
a kind of heightened anxiety.
某些人实际上会有点静息性震颤
Some people actually get a little bit of a resting tremor
他们吃饭之前
before they eat,
即使他们没有任何饮食失调
even if they don't have any sort of eating disorder.
就是自主神经活动有所增加
There's kind of a ramping up of autonomic activity.
这主要是由于这些AgRP神经元的活动
That's largely due to the activity of these AgRP neurons.
因此 这些AgRP神经元的活性
So, the activity in these AgRP neurons goes way up
当动物或人挨饿时  疯狂上升
when animals or people are starved.
我不是说饿了很长时间
And I don't mean starved for long periods of time,
但是我的意思是当他们有一段时间没吃东西了
but I mean when they haven't eaten for a while.
MSH的活性 MSH的释放上升
And the activity of MSH, the release of MSH goes up
吃完饭后
when we've eaten.
但是 还有其他一些事情会刺激
However, there are other things that will stimulate
释放诸如MSH之类的东西
the release of things like MSH.
因此 只是简要的讲一下实验证据
So, just briefly the experimental evidence,
如果杀死AgRP神经元 动物和人就会停止进食
if you kill AgRP neurons, animals and people stop eating.
有皮损的人
There are people of lesions.
他们只是停止进食 他们会厌食
They just stop eating, they become anorexic.
我知道你知道  厌食症是一个临床术语
I know you're familiar with anorexia as a clinical term,
但这实际上是一个使用过的术语
but that's actually a term that's used
在科学文献中
in the scientific literature
关于一种行为模式 好吗？
about a pattern of behavior, okay?
当然还有临床术语
As well as a clinical term of course.
如果你要刺激AgRP神经元
If you were to stimulate the AgRP neurons,
动物或人会疯狂地进食
animals or people eat like crazy.
他们会吃到破裂的地步
They will eat to the point where they burst.
这听起来很可怕 但它告诉你
Which just sounds horrible, but it just tells you
这是饮食上的促进剂
this is the accelerator on eating.
是的 它与我之前提到的
And yes, it has relationship
腹侧下丘脑有关系
to the ventromedial hypothalamus I talked about earlier,
但是我现在还不想回到那里
but I don't want to go back there just yet,
我们会回去讲的
we will circle back.
所以刺激黑素细胞的激素
So Melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
如此有趣的荷尔蒙
such an interesting hormone.
这东西可以遏制进食的欲望
This thing can shut down the desire to eat.
黑色素细胞刺激激素
The Melanocyte-stimulating hormone,
从垂体内侧释放
is released from the medial pituitary.
我们上次谈到垂体
We talked about the pituitary last time.
这是一个非常紧密定位的腺体
This is a gland that is very closely positioned
下丘脑
to the hypothalamus.
实际上一些下丘脑神经元
Actually some of the hypothalamus neurons
实际投射他们的神经联系
actually project their neural connections
直接进入垂体 释放出类似
directly into the pituitary, to release things like
促性腺激素和促黄体激素
gonadotropins and luteinizing hormones,
我们上次谈论的东西
stuff we talked about last time
关于睾丸激素和雌激素
in reference to testosterone and estrogen.
但是MSH是从垂体的内侧部分释放的
But MSH is released from the medial portion of the pituitary
它激发了不进食 停止进食的欲望
and it stimulates the desire to not eat, to cease eating.
真正有趣的是
What's really interesting,
是刺激黑素细胞的激素
is that Melanocyte-stimulating hormone
被紫外线激活
is activated by ultraviolet light.
而且不会被照射在皮肤上的紫外线激活
And it's not activated by ultraviolet light to the skin
或直接照射垂体上的紫外线激活
or directly to pituitary,
它是由紫外线照射到眼睛激活的
it's activated by ultraviolet light to the eyes.
那么  如果你一直在看这个播客
Now, if you've been watching this podcast
或在任何时间收听此播客
or listening to this podcast for any period of time,
或者你在其他播客中听到了我的声音
or you've heard me on other podcasts
或者你订阅了我的Instagram
or you follow my Instagram,
我是整个晨光的忠实拥护者
I am a big fan of this whole thing of getting morning light
为了使昼夜节律同步 等等
in order to synchronize circadian rhythms, et cetera,
避免在半夜里看光
avoiding light in the middle of the night.
这是另一个原因
This is yet another reason
为什么要获得充足的光线 最好是日光
why getting ample light, ideally sunlight,
但这可能是眼睛产生其他紫外线的来源
but it could be other sources of UV light to the eyes,
刺激MSH 这已被一遍又一遍地显示
stimulates MSH, this has been shown over and over again.
并控制饮食或食欲的欲望
And keeps the desire to eat or appetite in check,
在健康范围内
in healthy ranges.
这也是为什么在春季和夏季
This is also why in the spring and summer months,
动物和人会少吃东西
animals and people eat less.
那么  让动物冬眠变得不一样了
Now, for hibernating animals it's different,
因为他们实际上冬眠
because they bear hibernate, actually.
阿什利（Ashley）熊在技术上并没有真正冬眠
Ashley bears don't truly hibernate technically,
按照科学的标准 它们不会冬眠
by a scientific criteria they don't hibernate,
但是它们陷入了一种麻木状态
but they go into a kind of torpor.
冬眠的动物他们不吃很多东西
The hibernating animals they don't eat much
因为他们在洞里或窝点里
because they're in boroughs or dens,
或只是将自己包裹在一个小球中
or they're just wrapped up in a little ball
冬眠动物所做的一切
or whatever it is that hibernating animals do.
因此 他们当然会在冬天少吃点东西
So they're of course going to eat far less in the winter.
但这是一个独特的例子
But that's a unique scenario,
我们不是在冬眠动物
we are not hibernating animals.
但是人类通常在寒冷的冬季
But humans generally have greater appetite
有更强的食欲
in the cold winter months.
这不仅是因为假期
And it's not just because of the holidays
和丰富的食物
and the abundance of food
我们正在展现自己
that we're presenting ourselves with,
但是当我们有很多阳光时 我们的食欲就会降低
but when we get a lot of sun our appetite is reduced
或者至少更容易控制
or at least it's easier to control.
这是部分原因
And that is due in part,
因为如果你的眼睛得到充足的阳光
because if you're getting ample sunlight to the eyes,
它被转换成MSH神经元的信号
it's converted into a signal for the MSH neurons,
释放MSH的神经元 对不起
the neurons that release MSH, excuse me
这些PMOC神经元释放MSH
these PMOC neurons release MSH.
然后MSH可以结合其受体
And then MSH can bind its receptors,
并可以控制食欲不振
and can keep the break on appetite in check.
因此 这里的速食理论  简单来讲
So the takeaway tool from this,
就是要确保你得到足够的光线
is make sure you're getting enough light
不只是在早上 而是在全天
not just in the morning, but throughout the day.
是的 它必须对着你的眼睛
And yes, it has to be light to your eyes.
但不要用阳光或人造光轰炸你的眼睛
And blasting your eyes with sunlight or artificial light
到造成伤害或痛苦的地步
to the point where it's damaging or painful,
这不会加快或改善这个过程
won't accelerate or improve this process.
这是要获取光子
It's about getting photons,
紫外线持续照射到眼睛
ultraviolet light to the eyes consistently
一整天
throughout the day.
最好不要戴墨镜
That's best accomplished by not wearing sunglasses
只要你可以安全地做到这一点
provided you can do that safely.
如果没有足够的阳光
And if you don't have access to enough sunlight,
那么你可以使用人造光做到这一点
then you can do this with artificial light.
这也再次指出了我们的老朋友
This also points again to our old friends,
防蓝光眼镜
the blue blockers.
很多人知道我不是防蓝光眼镜的忠实拥护者
Many people know I'm not a huge fan of blue blockers
尤其是在白天
especially not during the daytime,
因为它们阻挡了很多紫外线
because they block a lot of the UV
挡住了应该想要和需要来创造警觉的  波长更短的光
and shorter wavelength light that you want and need
它还会导致来自垂体内侧的MSH释放
to create alertness, but also to create release of MSH from the medial pituitary.
现在有人
Now there are people out there,
亚文化 实际上会注入了MSH
subcultures, that actually inject MSH.
正在服用MSH或类似的药物
That are taking MSH or things similar to it.
我不建议人们这样做
I am not suggesting people do that.
但是这样做有三个主要后果
But there are three main consequences of doing that.
首先 它降低了食欲 这不足为奇
First of all, it reduces appetite, no surprise there.
他们实际上正在将其用作减肥药
And they're actually using it as a dieting drug.
这是地下的黑色产业
This is kind of in the underground.
我不知道法律方面这什么情况
I don't know what the legal status is.
再说一次 我不是在提倡人们这样做
And again, I'm not promoting that people do it.
第二 它使它们变得非常美黑 这讲得通 对吧？
Two, it makes them very, very tan, which makes sense, right?
黑色素细胞刺激激素
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone.
第三 据称  虽然它从未被尝试过
And the third is, it purportedly, never tried it,
据说它会产生很高的性欲
purportedly sends libido through the roof,
到真正分散注意力的那种程度
to the point where it's actually distracting
用于其他活动
for other activities.
它实际上可以制造持续勃起
It actually can create priapism,
这是男性的一种慢性勃起
which is a kind of chronic erection in males
到实际上可能对身体造成伤害到生殖器的地步
to the point where it actually can be physically damaging to the genitalia.
所以这是一种药物
So this is a drug,
我不知道它是否被称为药物
I don't know whether or not it's call it a drug.
这是一种可以调节健康水平的物质
It's a substance that one can regulate with healthy levels,
要伴随阳光和人造紫外线一起使用
with sunlight and perhaps artificial UV light.
我对肥胖症的治疗方法知之甚少
I have not heard much about treatments for obesity
涉及获得充足的阳光或获得充足的紫外线
involving getting ample sunlight or getting ample UV light,
但对我来说 逻辑很清楚
but to me, the logic is just very clear.
因此 如果你追求这些途径
And so if you're pursuing those avenues,
你当然应该和你的医生谈谈
you certainly should talk to your physician
但你可能要考虑一下
but you might want to think about
这些逻辑如何相互联系在一起
how some of those logic hangs together.
绝对迷人的荷尔蒙
Absolutely fascinating hormone,
我认为大多数人都不知道
I think most people aren't aware of it.
以及意识到这一点的亚文化
And the subcultures that are aware of it
正在将其用于两个非常特殊的终点
are using it for two very particular end points,
他们正在以超级生理水平使用它
and they're using it at super physiological levels.
不再讲那个了 因为我真的不知道
That's enough about that 'cause I really don't know.
我已经和一些研究人员进行了交谈
I've talked to a few people in research.
真的  因为这个播客
Believe it or not for this podcast,
我接触到了几个人
I reached out to a few people
并问这些是否是“副作用”
and asked whether or not the these are side effects
我听说过是真的 而且确实是真的
I've heard about are true, and indeed they're true.
但这又是超级生理学 控制MSH
But again, that's super physiological, controlling MSH,
实际上是Alpha MSH水平
it's actually Alpha MSH levels
通过观察紫外线
through viewing ultraviolet light
似乎很有趣
seems like an interesting
机制上也是合理的事情
and mechanistically logical thing to do,
如果你的目标是控制食欲
if your goal is to keep appetite in check.
因此 MSH可以抑制饥饿
So MSH inhibits hunger.
接下来 让我们谈谈荷尔蒙肽
Next, let's talk about a hormone peptide
激发饥饿感
that activates hunger.
这是一个非常有趣的
And this is a really interesting one
因为这和你饿的时候有关
because it relates to when you get hungry,
除了你饿了
in addition to the fact that you get hungry at all.
它叫做ghrelin 拼写为GHRELIN
And it's called ghrelin, it's spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.
生长激素释放肽实际上是从胃肠道释放的
Ghrelin is released actually from the GI tract.
它的主要作用是增加你的饮食欲望
And its main role is to increase your desire to eat.
它通过多种机制来做到这一点
And it does that through a variety of mechanisms.
部分原因是刺激某些大脑区域
Part of that is to stimulate some of the brain areas,
其中的神经元 让你想吃
the actual neurons, that make you want to eat.
此外 它还会产生食品预期信号
In addition, it creates food anticipatory signals
在你的神经系统内
within your nervous systems.
所以你开始思考事情
So you start thinking about the things
你喜欢吃东西
that you happen to like to eat
在一天中的特定时间
at that particular time of day.
这很神奇
And this is fascinating.
Ghrelin有点像时钟
Ghrelin is sort of like a clock,
使你想吃的荷尔蒙钟
a hormonal clock that makes you want to eat
在特定时间
at particular times.
那么  生长素释放肽的信号是让血液中的葡萄糖水平降低
Now, the signal for ghrelin is reduced glucose levels in the blood.
今天我们要谈论很多关于葡萄糖和胰岛素的话题
We're going to talk a lot today about glucose and insulin,
管理葡萄糖和胰岛素的方法
ways to manage glucose and insulin.
但是  这个简单的版本
But for now the simple version of this,
你通常要葡萄糖的水平
is you normally want your glucose
处于适度范围内
to be in a kind of modest range,
我会解释一下范围
and I'll explain what range is in a little bit.
但是 如果它下降得太低 则ghrelin会从你的肠道中分泌出来
But if it drops too low, ghrelin is secreted from your gut.
它在不同位置激活大脑中的神经元
It activates neurons in your brain at various locations
包括PMOC神经元
including the PMOC neurons,
以及其他神经元
and the other neurons of the wingin' it.
它还以特定方式激活VMH
It also activates the VMH in particular ways.
它甚至可能激活其中一些
And it might even activate some of these neurons
在你嘴巴周围的神经元
that are in the periphery in your mouth
那实际上会让你流口水 想吃东西 对不对？
that actually make you salivate and want to eat, right?
那么  我们都知道著名的“巴甫洛夫”实验
Now, we all know about the famous Pavlovian,
巴甫洛夫犬的实验
experiments of Pavlov's dogs.
你知道 他们开始垂涎三尺
You know, they start salivating to the bell.
钟声送来食物后 你将食物取出
After the bell was presented with food, you remove the food,
然后只有铃铛就可以刺激流涎
and then just the bell can stimulate the salivation.
我们有时会叫这个实验“巴甫洛夫人”
We become Pavlovian at times.
但是很少有人讨论过
But rarely is it ever discussed
这是什么神经通路
what the neural pathways for that are.
结果发现这些激素
And it turns out that these hormones
肠道分泌的物质可以刺激神经元
that are secreted from the gut can stimulate the neurons
对某些食物产生刺激和渴望
to create a sensation and a desire for certain foods
在一天中的某些时间
at certain times of day.
你已经完成了该实验
You've done this experiment.
如果你是吃早餐的人
If you are somebody who eats breakfast
每天差不多在同一时间
at more or less the same time each day,
假设上午8:00前后20分钟
let's say 8:00 AM plus or minus 20 minutes.
然后你在12:30前后20分钟吃午餐
And then you eat lunch 12:30 plus or minus 20 minutes.
或者说你是像我这样的人
Or let's say you're somebody like me
通常不吃早餐
who typically skips breakfast, and just eats lunch
通常在11:30或12点左右只吃午餐
usually around 11:30 or 12 or something like that.
你的生长素释放肽分泌物将开始匹配
Your ghrelin secretion will start to match
当你平时吃饭时
when you typically eat.
它做到了
And it does that.
而且它可以替代低水平的葡萄糖
And it's able to override the low levels of glucose
在你的血液中
in your bloodstream,
因为ghrelin系统也得到输入
because the ghrelin system also gets input
从你肝脏中的时钟
from a clock in your liver
与下丘脑的时钟有关
that is linked to the clock in your hypothalamus,
在你的大脑中
in your brain.
这意味着 如果你在正常用餐时间进食
And what this means is, if you eat at regular meal times,
你会在那些用餐时间之前几分钟
you'll start to get hungry a few minutes
开始饿了
before those meals times.
如果你曾经想过为什么
If you've ever wondered why
你的胃开始发出咕噜咕噜的声音
your stomach kind of starts to growl
因为这是一天中的特定时间
because it's a particular time of day,
你想 哦 我必须要吃饭
and you're like, Oh I must want to eat,
好吧 那是ghrelin
well, that's ghrelin.
对于那些不知道的人
And for those of you that don't know
为什么你的肚子会咆哮 今天我也要告诉你
why your stomach growls, I'll also tell you that today.
实际上 这真的很有趣
It's actually really interesting.
完全不是你所期望的
It not at all what you expect,
不仅是胃里的液体
and it's not just the gurgling of liquids in your stomach.
不是那样的
That's not what it is.
这实际上是一种肌肉现象
It's actually a muscular phenomenon.
因此 生长素释放肽被分泌为食物预期信号
So, ghrelin is secreted as a food anticipatory signal,
让你有动力定期去吃饭
to get you motivated to go eat at regular times.
所以 今天有很多兴趣
So, nowadays there's a lot of interest
间歇性禁食
in intermittent fasting.
一些饮食计划和时间表   以及一般吃什么
There's also a lot of interest in just what meal plans
也引起了人们的极大兴趣
and schedules and what to eat in general,
为了使自己的健康和福祉最大化
in order to maximize one's health and wellbeing.
人们有各种各样的化妆上的原因
And people have all sorts of cosmetic reasons
和大脑原因和代谢原因
and brain reasons and metabolic reasons
想要控制这种东西
for wanting to control this kind of stuff.
因此 让它变得非常简单
So let's make it really simple
首先看极端
by first looking at the extremes.
有些人需要每两三个小时吃饭一次
Some people need to eat every two or three hours.
他们感到：“我需要每两三个小时吃饭”
They feel this, "I need to eat every two or three hours,"
否则他们的血糖会下降
or else their blood sugar drops.
一般来说 血糖不会下降那么低
In general, blood sugar doesn't drop so low,
到人真的需要吃饭
that they truly need to eat
来减轻血糖问题
in order to alleviate a blood sugar issue.
尽管有时可能会发生
Although sometimes that can happen.
有些人确实是低血糖 低血糖
Some people are truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar.
但是大多数人随着血糖开始下降
But most people as the blood sugar starts to head down
朝向低迷区 生长素释放肽被分泌出来
towards the low-ish ranges, ghrelin is secreted.
因此 对于那些不准时吃饭的人
And so for those people not eating on the clock,
对他们来说是非常破坏性的
it's very disruptive to them
因为它激活了大脑中的这些神经元
because it activates these neurons in the brain.
对于每天吃一次或一天吃两次的人
For people who eat once a day or twice a day,
或倾向于改变他们的饮食
or tend to shift their meals,
你知道 他们可能会吃很多
you know, and they might eat a lot
但是在有限的所谓“进食窗口”内
but during a limited so-called feeding window,
现在人们在吃东西 谈论食物 这很有趣
it's kind of interesting humans now eat and talk about foods
以多年来我在课堂上听到的方式
in ways that for years I used to hear about in classes,
在课程中以及关于进食动物的研究讲座中
in courses, and research lectures about feeding animals,
你知道 进食窗口受到限制
you know, restricted feeding windows.
我们要感谢Satchin Panda
And we owe a great deal of gratitude to Satchin Panda,
我实验室在圣地亚哥时是我的同事
who was a colleague of mine when my lab was in San Diego
在索尔克研究所（Salk Institute） 他的确是先驱者之一
at the Salk Institute, who really is one of the pioneers
受限制的“进食窗口”研究
of this restricted feeding window work
并做了出色的工作
and has done a beautiful work.
他有一本叫《昼夜节律》的好书
He has a book that's excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
我强烈推荐
that I highly recommend.
他做了很多重要的工作
And he's done a lot of important work
在视网膜的神经元上 控制昼夜节律
on neurons in the retina, that control circadian timing,
还有进食窗和健康之间的关系
but also the relationship between feeding windows and health.
他是我应该说的“昼夜节食”  的主要支持者之一
And he's sort of among the major proponents I should say,
这意味着在白天进食
of circadian eating, that means eating during the daytime,
不在晚上或间歇性禁食
not at night or intermittent fasting,
限制进食窗口
restricting feeding windows
到4  /6/8个小时
to anywhere from four to six to eight hours.
我以自己为例
I'll use myself as an example
从常规进食时间表的过渡
of the transition from regular feeding schedule
断断续续的禁食
to a more intermittent-ish fasting,
尽管我并不是真正的间歇性禁食
although I don't really fall into true intermittent fasting.
所以我就是这些习惯的人之一
So I was one of these people that just got so accustomed
我醒来大约一个小时后醒来吃东西
to waking up and eating about an hour after I woke up.
每三四个小时吃一次就可以了
That to go from eating every three or four hours
每天午餐和晚餐吃两次
to eating twice a day, lunch and dinner,
也许下午有一些零食或其他东西
maybe a couple of snacks in the afternoon or something.
起初 这令人发指
At first it was excruciating.
我记得这样想
I remember thinking like,
这真是残酷的拒绝进食
this is really brutal pushing out feeding.
除非我先吃饭 否则我认为我不能运动
I didn't think I could exercise unless I had eaten first.
现在我们知道 在大多数形式的运动中
We now know that during most all forms of exercise
除非你真正专注于最佳运动表现
unless you're really focused on optimal performance
比如你要冲最大重量
like you've got to hit key lifts
或者必须以最快的速度冲刺
or you have to sprint at your maximum speed.
也许即使那样 你也可以不进食而更快地运动
And maybe even then that you can exercise faster just fine,
因为你主要依靠糖原等来源
because you're mainly relying on sources like glycogen
从肝脏中取出一些未消化的食物
from the liver, some undigested food sometimes,
看起来似乎很真实
as gross as that may seem it's true,
如果运动时间非常长 还需要补充体内的脂肪
as well as body fat if the exercise about is extremely long.
但这意味着如果你突然去
But what that means is that if you suddenly go
从定期吃饭到不吃一顿饭
from eating on a very regular schedule to skipping a meal,
或推迟用餐时间或完全转移时间
or pushing your meal timing out or shifting at all,
在你的身体系统中 将会产生ghrelin
you're going to have ghrelin in your system.
而生长素释放肽会刺激人们进食的欲望
And that ghrelin is going to stimulate the desire to eat
通过在你的大脑水平上行动
by acting at the level of your brain.
确实在那时 只是精神上的
And it is indeed at that point, just mental.
当我们听到关于心理 身体的信息时
When we hear about just mental, just physical,
这真的是同一回事
it's really kind of the same thing
因为这是所有化学物质 包括大脑和身体
'cause it's all chemicals, brain and body.
但是 预期进食的是神经元的刺激
But it's the stimulation of neurons that anticipate feeding.
你正在刺激弓形核神经元
You're stimulating the arcuate nucleus neurons
那些AgRP神经元那会让你想吃
that make you want to eat those AgRP neurons.
生长激素释放肽刺激AgRP神经元
So ghrelin stimulates the AgRP neurons,
这让你想吃
which makes you want to eat.
那你该怎么办呢？
So what can you do with this?
这是什么意思
What this means is,
如果你想开始改变你的进食时间表
if you want to start shifting your feeding schedule
到不那么频繁进食
to one where you're not eating quite as frequently,
而且有一些好处
and there are some advantages to that
不只是与生物化学和健康有关
that aren't just in the biochemistry and health related,
你知道 细胞健康有关的事情
you know, cellar health related things.
但是其中一些包括不必考虑
But some of them include not having to think about
还是买食物 对不对？
or buy food, right?
你实际上不必整天考虑食物
You actually don't have to think about food all day
如果你不经常吃东西
if you're not eating so often.
另一个是 它给你
The other is, it gives you
更大的社交灵活性 对不对？
a far more social flexibility, right?
如果需要 你可以参加中午会议
You can go to a noon meeting if you have to
或者你可以在特定时间外出吃晚饭
or you can go out to dinner at a particular time.
而且你知道 我想这很难
And you know, I guess it makes it kind of tough
如果你想约某人吃早餐
if you want to meet somebody for breakfast,
而你只能当个傻瓜
'cause then you're the dork
喝黑咖啡一样
who's just like sipping black coffee
拒绝一切早餐
and like refusing everything.
但是无论如何 我一直都是那个傻瓜
But anyway, I've been that dork.
因此 这就是你要调整的地方
So it's one of those things you just kind of work with.
但事实上 生长素释放肽的分泌
But the fact of the matter is, ghrelin secretion,
由于它与神经系统的关系
because of its relationship to the nervous system,
每天可以移动约45分钟
can be shifted by about 45 minutes per day.
那么  情况将有所不同
Now, it's going to vary.
你们当中有些人拥有更多的意志力
Some of you have more so-called willpower, you know.
但是如果你真的想开始
But if you really want to just start
去掉第一餐或向任何方向进行调整
pushing that first meal out or shifting in any direction,
有些人可能想在一天的早些时候吃东西
some people might want to eat in the early part of the day
而不是在晚上
and not in the evening.
尝试将进餐时间移出间隔
Trying to shift the mealtimes out the spacing
大约每天只能移动45分钟 这就是神经回路
by about 45 minutes, is what the neural circuits
将ghrelin系统重新连接到神经回路
that link the ghrelin system to the neural circuits
控制进食 在人的忍受范围内
that control feeding, really can handle
因为它是神经可塑性的一种形式
because it's a form of neuroplasticity.
所以真实情况就是
And so what this would look like is,
如果你通常在八点吃早餐
if you normally you eat breakfast at eight o'clock
前后20分钟
plus or minus 20 minutes,
如果你想在中午开始吃第一顿饭
and you want to start eating your first meal at noon
你可能要花四到五天调整
you would take maybe four or five days
开始把第一顿饭去掉
and just start pushing the meal out
每天早餐推后约45分钟到一个小时
by about 45 minutes to an hour each day.
因此 这并不会那么痛苦
So it's not quite as painful.
或者 你可以尝试一下 然后一次完成所有操作
Or you can just take the plunge and just do it all at once.
我有一位同事曾是斯坦福大学的神经外科医师
I have a colleague who was a neurosurgeon at Stanford,
通过我的实验室来 他现在在Neuralink
came up through my lab, he's now at Neuralink,
并且他有很好的练习
and he has a great practice.
他使自己的生长素释放肽系统保持随机状态
He keeps his ghrelin system at random.
他要做的就是每天不吃一顿饭
What he does is he skips one meal per day
然后他根据自己的外部时间表来决定这一点
and he makes his external schedule dictate that.
因此 有时他不吃早餐 有时不吃午餐
So, sometimes he skips breakfast, sometimes he skips lunch,
有时他不吃晚餐
sometimes he skips dinner,
他只是每天跳过三餐中的一餐
he just skips one of the three major meals per day.
而在这种情况下 ghrelin系统
And in doing that, the ghrelin system
就一直在变动
has always kind of kept off kilter.
而且可能还能让他
And it probably also allows him
产生很大的神经灵活性
to have a lot of neural flexibility,
我们称之为自上而下的控制
what we call top-down control.
只是知识 哦 你知道我的饥饿感
Just the knowledge, Oh, you know the hunger I'm feeling
不一定是缺少血糖
isn't necessarily hypoglycemia.
在他的情况下 可以肯定不是
And in his case, it's almost certainly not.
因此 我在这里的感受
And therefore what I'm feeling here
是这些AgRP神经元的激活
is an activation of these AgRP neurons,
因此 我可以推迟我的用餐时间
and therefore I can push my meal schedule around however I want.
那么  我应该提到自上而下的机制非常强大
Now, I should mention that top-down mechanisms are powerful.
信念 动力
Belief, motivation,
这些事情确实可以改变神经回路
these things can really shift neural circuits.
我们稍后再讨论更多
We're going to talk more about that a little bit later.
但是也有一些人真正有低血糖
But there are also people who are genuinely hypoglycemic
那么他们需要很好地控制血糖水平
and they need to take really good control
并尝试使其保持稳定
of their blood sugar levels and try and keep them stable.
所以 当然 你想做
And so of course, you want to do
医学上安全的东西
what's medically safe for you.
我一点也不推荐
I'm not at all recommending
患有低血糖症的人
that people that suffer from hypoglycemia
去突然破坏他们的血糖模式
suddenly disrupt their blood sugar patterns
在任何方向上 那都不是健康的
in any direction, that wouldn't be healthy.
但是对于大多数人来说
But for most people out there
也就是血糖水平合理的人
who have reasonable blood glucose levels,
这既有趣又有趣
it's kind of interesting and kind of fun
去摆弄这些参数
to play with these parameters
去优化你想做的事
in order to optimize what you want to do.
有时你可以一年变动一次日程表
And sometimes that might change across the year with schedules.
许多人发现拥有灵活性对进食有很大的好处
Many find great benefit in having flexibility over when they eat.
饮食规律等于生长素释放肽分泌规律
Regularity of eating equals regularity of ghrelin secretion
等于这些AgRP神经元的活动规律
equals regularity of activity of these AgRP neurons,
这意味着你会经常饿
meaning you'll be hungry at very regular intervals.
这就是你可以使用的东西
So that's something that you can work with,
植根于深层机制
it's grounded in deep mechanism
激素和神经系统
of hormone and neural systems,
而且有很多现代研究
and there's a lot of modern research
支持我刚才所说的
to support what I just said.
所以 如果MSH抑制进食 使我们想少吃
So, if MSH inhibits feeding, makes us want to eat less
而ghrelin让我们想多吃点东西
and ghrelin makes us want to eat more,
还有一种叫做CCK的激素 胆囊收缩素
there's another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin,
可以有效减少我们的饥饿感
that is potent in reducing our levels of hunger.
那么  我在大学的时候就了解了CCK
Now, I learned about CCK back when I was an undergraduate.
因此 应该是在20多年前 那时它才首次被发现
So, well over 20 years ago, when it was first discovered.
那时 CCK风很大
And there was a lot of excitement about CCK at that point
作为减肥药
as a diet drug.
你知道 只要有分子
You know, anytime there's a molecule
或在大脑或身体中发现的化学物质
or a chemical discovered in the brain or body
可以抑制进食 因此饮食业疯狂了
that can suppress feeding, the diet industry just goes wild
他们认为 这将成为“神药”
and they think, this is going to be the thing
这将使人们摆脱肥胖
that's going to allow people to move from being obese
减轻各种不健康的体重等等
to losing all sorts of unhealthy weight, et cetera.
瘦素被发现时  也有类似现象
A similar phenomenon was observed with leptin.
瘦素是一种由体内脂肪产生的激素
Leptin is a hormone that's made by body fat
当体内脂肪过多时 它会向大脑发出信号
that signals to the brain when there's a lot of body fat,
在动物体内注射瘦素
and in animals injections of leptin
可以使胖动物变瘦
can make fat animals thin.
他们失去了很多脂肪或脂肪
They lose a lot of adipose or fat.
在人类中 这种方式并非可行
In humans, it didn't work out that way.
研究仅仅显示 瘦素就成功了
It just the studies were done and leptin was successful
在治疗某种罕见的糖尿病时
in treating a certain rare form of diabetes,
但它确实不是非常有效的抗肥胖药
but it really wasn't very potent as an anti-obesity drug.
同样 CCK被视为肥胖药
Similarly, CCK has been looked at as an obesity drug,
减轻肥胖的东西
something to reduce obesity.
但是它有一些非常不好的副作用
But it had some pretty unhappy side effects
实际上造成了一些非常严重的副作用
actually caused some pretty serious side effects.
现在这就是毒品
Now that's as drug.
但是 当你的肠以正常水平释放时 CCK
However, CCK when released at normal levels by your gut
有强大的作用
has a powerful effect
可以在一段时间内抑制食欲
in suppressing appetite for a period of time.
并且有健康直接的方法来激活CCK
And there are healthy and direct ways to activate CCK.
那么  CCK在胃肠道中
Now, CCK is in the GI tract,
它是从胃肠道中释放出来的
it's released from the GI tract.
它的释放受两方面支配
And it's release is governed by two things.
一个是非常专有的神经元的集合
One is a subset of very specialized neurons
可以检测出肠道中的东西
that detect what's in the gut,
肠道的具体包含了什么
the specific contents of the gut.
根据黏膜上用于感受的某些成分
And by certain elements of the mucosa,
肠道粘液衬里和肠道微生物组
of the mucus lining of the gut and the gut microbiome.
所以真正有趣的是
So what's really interesting,
是CCK被脂肪酸刺激然后释放了
is that CCK is stimulated by fatty acids
以及我们将要讨论的特定脂肪酸
and particular fatty acids that we'll talk about.
氨基酸 特别是接下来要讲的氨基酸
Amino acids, and particular amino acids
以及糖
that we'll talk about, as well as by sugar.
那么  让我们将糖放一边
Now, let's put sugar on the shelf for a moment.
我们将谈论很多关于糖的问题
We're going to talk a lot about sugar
因为如果CCK抑制食欲并减少进食
because if CCK inhibits appetite and reduces feeding,
可能是由脂肪酸 氨基酸
and it can be triggered by fatty acids, amino acids,
或糖 那么你可能会说
or sugars, then you might say,
好吧 那么吃很多糖
well, then in eating a lot of sugars
应该会让我们不想多吃
should make us not want to eat more,
但是我们都知道吃糖
but we all know that eating sugar
会让我们想吃得多
makes us want to eat far more.
那就是很多糖的作用
That's the role of a lot of sugars.
这与一个单独的机制有关
And that has to do with a separate mechanism
我们今天等下再谈
we'll talk about today.
因此 肠内有哪些脂肪酸
So, which fatty acids in the gut
能刺激CCK释放？
stimulate the release of CCK?
原来是omega-3脂肪酸
It turns out it's the omega-3 fatty acids,
来自藻类 磷虾或鱼油的油
the ones that come from algae or krill or fish oil.
我在营养一集中谈到了这一点
I talked about this in the episode on nutrition
以及一些与肠道微生物组有关的事物
and some of the things related to the gut microbiome.
我现在将重新讨论这一点
And I'm going to revisit that now.
Omega-3脂肪酸和共轭亚油酸（CLA）
Omega-3 fatty acids and Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA,
无论是来自食物还是补品
either from food or from supplements,
都会刺激CCK的释放
stimulate the release of CCK
然后降低或至少钝化食欲
which then reduces, or at least blunts appetite.
我不是在说导致食欲不振
And I'm not talking about blunting appetite
到完全不想进食的厌食症水平
to anorexic levels where you don't want to eat at all.
我说的是调节食欲
I'm talking about regulating appetite
到动物和人都不会过度进食的地步
to the point where animals and people don't over-consume.
因此 它可以保持食欲健康
So it's keeping appetite at a healthy level.
我提到的另一个物质  也会激发了CCK
The other thing that stimulates CCK that I mentioned,
那就是氨基酸
are amino acids.
所以当我们吃饭时 我们有能力分解
So when we eat, we have the ability to break down
各种不同的常量营养素 碳水化合物 脂肪
different macronutrients, you know, carbohydrates, fats
或蛋白质 变成糖和葡萄糖
or proteins, into sugars and glucose,
然后我们可以转换为ATP
that then we can convert to ATP
这些高中课本上都会学到  柠檬酸循环
and all that stuff from a Krebs cycle from high school.
我们今天不打算讨论这一点
We're not going to go into that today,
这是未来的播客会讨论的内容
that's for a future episode.
但是氨基酸是
But amino acids are one of the things
我们正在吃的东西其中之一
that we are eating for.
氨基酸都可以用作能量
Amino acids both can be used as energy
通过称为“糖异生”的过程
through a process called gluconeogenesis,
将蛋白质转化为能量的过程
of converting proteins into energy.
同时  那些氨基酸可以被分解
Or those amino acids can be broken down
然后再改成诸如
and then rebuilt into things like preparing, excuse me,
修复肌肉组织
repairing muscle tissue
以及其他形式的细胞修复
as well as other forms of cellar repair.
他们参与各种各样的事情
They're involved in all sorts of things
都与蛋白质合成有关
related to protein synthesis.
这是什么意思？
What does this mean?
如果我们以适当的水平吃适当的氨基酸
If we eat the proper amino acids at the proper levels,
如果我们摄入omega-3和CLA 共轭亚油酸
if we ingest omega-3's and CLA's, Conjugated linoleic acids
在适当的水平 或从补充中获取它们
at the proper levels, or get them from supplements,
会有食欲不振
there's a blunting of appetite.
食欲保持控制 我们不会变得食欲亢进
Appetite is kept clamped and we don't become hyperphagic.
我们不会吃得过饱
We don't overeat.
我们倾向于在健康或正常范围内进食
We tend to eat within healthy or normal ranges.
所以这很重要
So this is very important,
因为大多数人不了解我们吃饭时
because most people don't understand that when we're eating,
我们基本上是寻觅脂肪和觅食氨基酸
we are basically fat foraging and amino acid foraging.
现在有几项研究表明
And there are several studies now have shown,
人和动物基本上都会一直吃
that people and animals will essentially eat
直到他们觉得自己已经摄取了足够的omega-3
until they feel they've consumed enough omega-3's,
omega-6 CLA和某些氨基酸
omega-6's, CLA's, and certain amino acids.
换句话说 它不是有意识的
In other words, even if it's not conscious,
我们一直在吃东西 直到触发CCK激活为止
we are eating until we trigger the activation of CCK.
那么  还有其他原因导致我们也停止进餐
Now, there are other reasons why we shut down eating too.
比如   我们肠道中的食物量可能很大
Are literally, the volume of food in our gut can be large,
我们会感到非常胀
and we can feel very distended.
显然 这是物理原因
That's the physical reason obviously.
还有其他原因
There are other reasons,
也许我们只有自上而下的控制
maybe we just have top-down control.
我们知道这顿饭差不多就到这里了
We have knowledge that this is the end of the meal
我们停下来 因为我们必须回去工作
and we stop 'cause we have to go back to work
或参加会议 或者我们告诉自己我们已经吃够了
or to a meeting, or we tell ourselves we've had enough.
但是在潜意识的层面上
But at a subconscious level,
肠道通过CCK和其他机制通知大脑
the gut is informing the brain via CCK and other mechanisms
当我们摄入了足够的食物之后
when we've ingested enough of what we need.
这些omega-3和CLA和某些氨基酸
And these omega-3's and CLA's and certain amino acids
对于发出我们已经受够的信号至关重要
are vital for sending out that signal that we've had enough.
那么  至于是哪些氨基酸呢  实际上很有趣
Now, which amino acids is actually really interesting?
我们有必需氨基酸
We have essential amino acids
还有非必需氨基酸
and we have non-essential amino acids.
在必需氨基酸中
Among the essential amino acids,
特别是有一个
there's one in particular
可以非常有效地触发CCK的释放
that can trigger the release of CCK very potently,
那就是谷氨酰胺
and that's glutamine.
谷氨酰胺是一种非常有趣的氨基酸
Glutamine is a very interesting amino acid.
首先 它已经在一些研究中显示
First of all, it's been shown in a few studies
在增强免疫系统中发挥作用
to play a role in bolstering the immune system.
它可以增加杀伤细胞的数量
It can increase the number of killer cells
在免疫系统中
in the immune system.
它被消耗 但以补剂形式
It is consumed but in supplement form.
比如  人们可以服用
You know, people can take it.
每次一茶匙的谷氨酰胺
You know, a teaspoon of glutamine
或有些人全天服用谷氨酰胺
or some people take glutamine throughout the day,
如果他们真的很喜欢它 或者出于某种原因
if they're really into it or for whatever reason,
他们认为自己正在与感染作斗争
they think they're battling off an infection
或类似的想法
or something of that sort.
谷氨酰胺当然也可以来源于食物
Glutamine can also of course be derived from foods.
然后你就可以上网
And you can just put into the Internet,
进行互联网搜索了
do an Internet search
并找出哪些食物富含谷氨酰胺
and find out what foods are rich with glutamine.
我意识到有些问题
Some of the ones that I'm aware of off the top of my head
就像奶酪 之类的东西
are like cottage cheese, and things of that sort.
但是其他食物也有谷氨酰胺
But other foods have glutamine as well.
谷氨酰胺一旦达到阈值水平
Once a threshold level of glutamine
和其他必需氨基酸
and other essential amino acids are reached,
一旦这些Alpha-3的阈值水平 说错了
once the threshold level of these Alpha-3, excuse me,
达到了Omega-3脂肪酸和CLA 释放了CCK
Omega-3 fatty acids and CLA's are reached, CCK is released,
它有助于减少
and it helps reduce the activity
那些促进进食的AgRP神经元的活动
of those AgRP neurons that promote feeding.
如你所见 进食是一种
So as you can see, feeding is an interplay
在大脑和身体之间的相互作用
between brain and body.
这是一些微量营养素
And it's some of the micronutrients
甚至某些营养素的分解
and even the breakdown of particular nutrients,
这就是加速器
that's putting the accelerator
或进食过程中的刹车
or the brake on the feeding process.
这不只是一件事
It's not just one thing.
因此 从可行的角度来看
So from an actionable standpoint,
你 我们可能都应该无论如何去尝试获取
you, we should probably all be trying to get our omega-3,
我们的正确omega-3/ Omega-6比例
Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
因为它们是抗抑郁药
because they are antidepressant.
我谈到了同行评议的研究
I talked about the peer reviewed studies on that.
他们对肠道微生物组很健康
They are healthy for the gut microbiome,
我们应该寻求足够的谷氨酰胺
and we should be seeking sufficient glutamine.
那么  你是否决定
Now, whether or not you decide
是否补充谷氨酰胺 取决于你
to supplement with glutamine or not, is up to you.
为什么要这样做的原因之一
One of the reasons why one might want to do that,
再说一遍 你应该总是去看医生
and again, you should always check with a doctor,
特别是如果你对癌症有任何易感性
especially if you have any predisposition to cancers
或者你患有癌症 许多癌症和肿瘤 例如谷氨酰胺
or you have cancer, many cancers and tumors like glutamine,
这点需要特别注意
so that's something to note.
但是你可能想补充谷氨酰胺的原因之一
But one reason why you might want to supplement with glutamine
或考虑吃富含谷氨酰胺的食物
or consider eating foods that are rich in glutamine,
不只是为了保持胃口健康
isn't just to keep your appetite in healthy ranges,
而是因为  谷氨酰胺实际上也可以减少对糖的渴望
but as well, glutamine can actually reduce sugar cravings.
因此 这非常有趣
So this is very interesting.
我有一个朋友 他是个绝对的巧克力 糖果迷
I have a friend, he's an absolute chocolate, sweets addict.
他是成年人 但他吃糖果和巧克力
He's a grown adult, but he eats candy and chocolate
好像他像一个14岁的孩子
as if he was like a 14 year old kid
在当地的便利店闲逛
hanging out at the local convenience store.
真是不可思议
It's really incredible.
他可能有糖瘾
And he has probably a sugar addiction,
但他很清楚
but he's very aware of this
并且他设法戒掉了其他的瘾头
and he's managed to kick all other addictions.
因此 无论出于何种原因 这个糖瘾  就一直刺激他的大脑和身体
So, for whatever reason, it stimulates his brain and body
让他想要更多 而他讨厌这一点
in the ways that make him want more, but he hates this.
实际上 这让他很沮丧
It's actually quite frustrating for him.
他是一个非常关心自己健康的人
He's somebody who cares a lot about his health.
他采取了我知道很多其他人都采用的方法
He took the approach that I know many other people have
利用谷氨酰胺的作用
who know about this role of glutamine,
服用一茶匙
of taking a teaspoon
或几茶匙的谷氨酰胺
or a couple of teaspoons of glutamine
在一天中或任何时候  当他渴望糖分的时候就服用
several times throughout the day or anytime he craves sugar.
的确 谷氨酰胺确实减少了对糖的渴望
And indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
一些真正处于生酮战线的人
Some people who are really on the kind of ketogenic front,
将其与一半和一半混合
will mix it with a little bit of half and half
然后
and down that,
我猜是因为想它使它的味道更好
and because I guess it makes it taste better,
有点结块
it's a little bit chalky.
因此 谷氨酰胺具有一些非常有趣的特性
So, glutamine has some very interesting properties.
但我认为对于大多数人
But I think for most people
没有遭受不良渴望的​​痛苦
that aren't suffering from adverse levels of craving,
只要确保你获得了正确的omega-3
making sure you're getting the right omega-3's
可能来自多种来源
that can come from a variety of sources,
看看我们在营养上做的那集
check out the episode we did on nutrition
如果你想了解更多有关此的信息
if you want to learn more about that.
还有CLA
And CLA's, and making sure
你摄入了足够的谷氨酰胺
that you're getting enough glutamine
将非常有利于
is going to be important for making sure
CCK信号通过
that the CCK signal gets through.
关于谷氨酰胺 我想提一件事
The one thing I do want to mention about glutamine,
这是次要的影响 但仅此一项就可以有小幅增长
it's a minor effect, but it alone can have a small increase,
对不起 单凭这一点就能增加血糖
excuse me, it alone can increase blood sugar.
血糖升高不是很大
It's not a huge increase in blood glucose.
但是因为肠子吸收蛋白质
But because the gut takes proteins
并将它们分解成这些氨基酸
and breaks them down into these amino acids,
基本上是在寻找谷氨酰胺之类的东西
and essentially looking for glutamine and things like it,
其他必需氨基酸也是如此
other essential amino acids as well.
当你摄取谷氨酰胺或支链氨基酸时
When you ingest glutamine or branch chain amino acids,
血糖有少量但真正的增加
there is a small but real increase in blood glucose.
那是因为它们本质上是食物
And that's because they are essentially food.
我在说补充版本
And there I'm talking about the supplemental version.
因此 只要知道谷氨酰胺可以稍微增加血糖
So, just know glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly,
特别是糖尿病患者应该知道这一点
especially diabetics should know that.
它可以减少食糖的渴望
It can reduce sugar cravings.
并且只知道你的肠道  它在本质层面上
And just know that what your gut is doing at a core level
一直在锻炼  等待
is it's forging, it's waiting,
它一直在评估omega-3脂肪酸的水平
and it's trying to assess levels of omega-3 fatty acid,
共轭亚油酸的水平
conjugated linoleic acid,
以及谷氨酰胺和其他必需氨基酸的水平
and glutamine, and other essential amino acids.
你基本上是想吃些营养素
You are essentially trying to eat to get these nutrients
然后可以将信号部署到你的大脑
and then a signal can be deployed up to your brain,
你对吃那么多不是很感兴趣
that you're not really interested in eating that much more.
每当为此播客准备时
Whenever preparing an episode for this podcast
我总是面临一个特殊的挑战
I'm always faced with a particular challenge,
我应该提供多少种工具
which is, how many tools should I offer
涉及做一些新的事情？
that involve doing something new?
你知道 一种新的行为 一种新的锻炼 补剂
You know, a new behavior, a new exercise, supplement,
诸如此类的东西
something, things of that sort.
还有多少应该不让你们做的事
And how many should be related to not doing things,
应该避免事情
avoiding things.
谈论这些我们应该避免的东西
It's never really fun to talk about
从来都不是一件真正有趣的事
all the things that we're supposed to avoid,
但其中一些是如此强大
but some of them are so powerful
根据给定主题的机制
in light of the mechanisms of a given topic
如果我不提它们的话 我就没尽到责任
that I'd be remiss if I didn't mention them.
所以现在你已经了解荷尔蒙
So now you understand how hormones,
还有CCK和Ghrelin等肽会影响食欲
and peptides like CCK and ghrelin impact appetite.
食物有一个特定方面
There's one particular aspect of food
可以极大地影响CCK
that can powerfully impact CCK.
我想大多数人
And I think most people,
我猜有99.9％的人
I'm guessing 99.9% of people out there
不知道这一点
are not aware of this.
它与高度加工的食物有关
And it has to do with highly processed foods.
为什么要避免高度加工的食物有很多原因
There's a lot of reasons why one would want to avoid highly processed foods.
实际上 如果你对该主题感兴趣
In fact, if you're interested in that topic
以及在这个国家中
and the history of whole foods,
天然食物过渡到高度加工的食物的历史
transitioning to highly processed foods in this country,
我强烈建议你看一个YouTube视频
I highly recommend you listen to a YouTube video
罗伯特·卢斯蒂格（Robert Lustig）博士
by Dr. Robert Lustig,
他在加州大学旧金山分校任职
he's at university of California, San Francisco.
只要输入  斯坦福（Stanford） 罗伯特·路斯蒂格（Robert Lustig）  很快就能找到
It's very easy to find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
这是斯坦福大学主持的演讲
it was a talk hosted by Stanford.
对此历史进行了漂亮的描述
Gives a a beautiful description of the history of this,
以及为什么食品工业开始包装
and why the food industry started packing in
其他糖和盐
additional sugars and salts,
并把食物变成商品 这真的很着迷
and turning foods into commodities, it's really fascinating.
它没有阴谋论 只是一切科学事实
It has no conspiracy theory is just all scientific facts.
这真是一场精彩的演讲
It's really a wonderful lecture.
播放量有数百万 应该非常容易找到
It has millions of views, it should be very easy to find.
我们可以提供一个链接
We can provide a link to that, and we will.
还有另一个原因
There's another reason
为了避免高度加工的食物
to avoid highly processed foods however,
这与所谓的乳化剂有关
and that has to do with what's called emulsifiers.
那么  你们中的许多人都熟悉乳化剂
Now, many of you are familiar with emulsifiers,
即使你不知道
even though you don't know it.
举个例子   当你将洗涤剂放入衣物中时
When you put detergent in the laundry
洗衣液就包含乳化剂 该洗涤剂的目标
that contains emulsifiers, the goal of that detergent
是将脂肪分子与水分子结合在一起
is to bring together fatty molecules with water molecules
并能够分离它们并分解它们
and be able to dissociate them and break them up
去除衣服和类似物品上的污渍
to get the stains out of clothes and things of that sort.
加工食品中有很多乳化剂
There are a lot of emulsifiers put into processed foods.
这些乳化剂允许某些化学反应
And those emulsifiers allow certain chemical reactions
会延长这些食品的保质期
to occur that extends the shelf life of those foods.
比如说糖果和谷物
So it's like candy bars and cereals,
以及加工食品中的各种东西
and all sorts of things that are in processed foods.
最坏的是那种糕点
The worst of which are the typical kind of pastries
你在便利店看到的东西
that you see at the convenience store.
以及一些薯片
But this extends into chips of various kinds
甚至是各种肉
and even some meats of various kinds,
他们把这些东西装进肉里
they pack this stuff into meats.
这些物质包括  大豆卵磷脂和其他东西
They have names like soy lecithin and other things.
乳化剂为什么不好？
Why are emulsifiers bad?
恩 有很多原因导致它们不好
Okay, there are a lot of reasons why they're bad,
但它们之所以
but the reason why they're bad
对于我们今天讨论的机制不好的原因
for the mechanisms that we've been talking about today,
就是当你摄取这些食物时
is that when you ingest those foods,
你在将这些乳化剂带入你的肠道
you're bringing those emulsifiers into your gut.
那些乳化剂就消失在
And those emulsifiers strip away
肠道的粘膜衬里
the mucosal lining of the gut,
它们实际上会引起神经支配肠道
and they actually cause the neurons that innervate the gut,
延伸出一些小反应
that extend those little processes
我们称轴突进入肠道 以更深地缩回肠道
we call axons into the gut, to retract deeper into the gut.
结果 你正在摄取一堆食物
And as a consequence, you're ingesting a bunch of food
而且CCK之类的信号永远也不会部署到大脑
and the signals like CCK never get deployed.
无法真正消除饥饿的信号
The signals that actually shut down hunger
不能真正触发
are never actually triggered.
因此 你会想要吃得更多
And so, as a consequence you want to eat far more
这些高度加工的食物
of these highly processed foods.
另外 如果你再
In addition, if you then go
从原本吃高度加工的食物
from eating a highly processed food
转变为吃非高度加工的食物
to non highly processed foods,
你回无法测量氨基酸的量
you're not able to measure the amounts of amino acids,
无法准确无误地测量食物中的糖和脂肪酸的含量
sugars, and fatty acids in those foods as accurately.
你实际上已经在微观层面造成了到肠粘膜衬里
You've actually done structural damage at a micro level,
结构性破坏 对不起
but structural level damage, excuse me,
结构上的损害
to the mucosal lining of the gut.
但是  这一切都可以修复
Now, this can all be repaired
如果你远离高度加工的食物
if you stay away from highly processed foods
只要一段时间
for some period of time.
但是这些乳化剂的负面影响
But the negative effects of these emulsifiers
是很真实的
are quite real.
因此 要使其真正干净和简单
So, to make it really clean and simple,
高度加工食品中的乳化剂
emulsifiers from highly processed foods
限制了你肠道的功能
are limiting your guts ability
它无法检测你所吃的食物中有什么
to detect what's in the foods you eat
无法部署饱食感信号
and therefore to deploy the satiety signals,
消除饥饿的信号
the signals that shut down hunger.
除此之外 还有并行机制在起作用
In addition to that, there's a parallel mechanism at play,
我在上一集中谈到的
that I talked about in a previous episode
我再次说一下 你的肠内有神经元
but I'll remind you again, that you have neurons in your gut
可以感觉到糖
that are sensing sugar,
并向大脑发出潜意识的信号
and are sending a subconscious signal up to the brain
通过迷走神经
via the vagus nerve.
这些神经元触发多巴胺的释放
And those neurons trigger the release of dopamine,
这会让你渴望更多的食物
which makes you crave more of that food.
所以现在你有了并行信号
So now you've got parallel signals
让你想吃更多的糖
making you want to eat more sugar,
使你不知道自己吃了多少糖
making you unaware of how much sugar you've eaten,
破坏了神经系统的输入
and that are disrupting the inputs to the nervous system
该信号传递到你的大脑和身体的其余部分
that signal to the rest of your brain and body
你已经获得足够的脂肪酸
that you've obtained enough fatty acids
并且你已经获得了足够的氨基酸
and you've obtained enough amino acids.
因此 这些高度加工的食物真的很糟糕
So these highly processed foods are really terrible.
我不是在这里说
And you know, I'm not out here to say,
什么  永远不要去享受任何形式的加工食品
you know, never enjoy a processed food of any kind,
那就太虚伪了 因为我自己也时不时地吃加工食品
I'd be a hypocrite 'cause I do eat processed foods from time to time.
虽然我倾向于吃那些
Although the ones that I tend to eat,
更健康的品种
I try and make of the healthier variety.
但是吃天然食物具有巨大的价值
But eating whole foods has tremendous value
吃高度加工的食物
and eating highly processed food
对肠道有巨大的负面影响
has tremendous negative impact on the gut
对肠脑轴也有不好的影响
and on the gut brain axis.
因此 最近有一篇论文发表了
And so, recently there was a paper that came out
在Cell 期刊中
in Cell, Cell Press journal,
这是Cell期刊的制高点
it's kind of the apex of Cell journals,
这是一个了不起的期刊
which is a phenomenal.
本文表明 摄入高度加工的食物
This paper showed that, ingesting highly processed food
导致摄入更多的不只是高度加工的食物
leads to more intake of not just highly processed foods
但一般来说是其他类型的食物
but other types of food in general.
有种暴饮暴食的补偿
There was kind of an overeating compensation
通常是跨食物的
generally across foods
对于食用这些高度加工食品的人们
for people that consume these highly processed foods.
还有很多其他原因
And there are a lot of other reasons
都说明了需要避免高度加工的食物
to avoid highly processed foods.
再说一遍 我不想过分专注于不让大家做的事情
So again, I don't like to focus too much on the do nots,
我喜欢提出一些方法  工具
I like to arm you with tools to do.
但是我认为某些食物的视觉效果
But I think this visual of certain foods
这些乳化剂  实际上会剥离
and these emulsifiers actually stripping away
肠道的一些关键部位
some of the critical lining of your gut
并破坏激素向大脑控制进食的部分的信号传递
and disrupting the hormone signaling to the brain
这其实非常重要 也很神秘
controlling feeding, is important enough and cryptic enough,
意思是没有被很经常地讨论过
meaning it hasn't been talked about,
它在潜意识层面上起作用
it works at a subconscious level,
意识到这一点很重要
and that it's important that people are aware of it
这样大家就可以决定要吃什么
so they can make decisions about what they do want to eat
到底想不想吃饭
or not want to eat for themselves.
在继续之前 我只想说一件事
Before moving on, I just want to say one more thing
关于高度加工的食物
about highly processed foods.
有一个绝对棒的研究
There was an absolutely beautiful study
由我的同事 斯坦福大学的克里斯·加德纳（Chris Gardner）完成
done by my colleague, Chris Gardner at Stanford,
他探索了
exploring whether or not
某些饮食  是不是真的比其他饮食好
certain diets were better than others.
他们看了严格素食主义者 素食主义者 杂食
They looked at vegan, vegetarian, omnivore,
我不知道他们是否看过所有肉类
I don't know if they looked at all meat or not,
但是他们研究了不同形式的饮食
but they looked at the different forms of diets,
间歇性禁食等
intermittent fasting, et cetera.
他们本质上发现
And they essentially found that,
无论人们坚持哪种饮食
whichever diet people adhered to,
他们遵循的任何一个  都等同于其他
whichever one they followed, was equivalent to the others.
只要他们遵循同一个饮食结构
Provided that they followed it,
掉的体重是一样的
they lost the equivalent amount of weight.
所以食物类型或饮食方式等等
There really wasn't a strong effect of the food type
真的没有什么很强的效果或者作用
or the pattern of eating, et cetera.
但是 在这样的研​​究中
However, in a study like that,
依从性很高 因为人是研究的一部分
adherence is very high because people are a part of a study.
对于很多人来说
And for many people,
遵守特定饮食计划的能力
the ability to adhere to a certain eating plan
对于给定饮食  这种营养计划是否起作用
is one of the most, if not the most powerful determinants
是最强大的决定因素之一
of whether or not a given diet
如果不是最强大的话
meaning nutritional plan works.
那么  关于高度加工食品的事情
Now, this thing about highly processed foods however,
真的是魔鬼
is really diabolical.
因为它确实说
Because it truly says,
我认为细胞代谢的最新数据
and I think the recent data in cell metabolism
其他期刊确实证明了这一点
and other journals really proves that,
卡路里不是卡路里
a calorie is not a calorie.
由于这些乳化剂 这绝对是荒谬的
That's absolutely absurd because of these emulsifiers
以及这些高度加工食品的内容
and the contents of these highly processed foods.
实际上 人类的数据就是这一点
In fact, the data in humans points to this.
所以他们所做的就是他们带了住院的成年人
So what they did is they took in-patient adults,
因此他们完全控制了自己的食物摄入量
so they had total control over their food intake.
他们接受了超加工
And they received either ultra processed
或进行短期研究 14天的饮食
or unprocessed diets for 14 days, as a short study.
饮食中要搭配卡路里 糖
The diets were matched for calories, sugar,
脂肪 纤维和大量营养素
fat, fiber, and macronutrients.
所以其他所有东西都匹配了
So everything else was matched.
刚处理或未处理是主要变量
Just processed or non-processed is the major variable.
他们发现的
And basically what they found,
基本上是那些正在吃加工食品的人
is that the people who are eating the processed food diet
碰巧吃了更多
happened to eat much more, right?
这是在这期间他们要么饮食
This was after this period of putting them on either diet
严格控制所有其他变量
and clamping for all other variables.
然后他们会吃得更多
Then they would eat much more,
体重变化更多
and the body weight changes were much more.
那些体重变化的样子
And those body weight changes,
使得他们无法仅仅考虑
were such that they couldn't be accounted for
只是因为增加了卡路里
by just increased calories.
因此 最重要的是高度加工的食物
So, the bottom line is that highly processed foods
对你不好
are just bad for you.
它们会让你增加体重
They increase weight gain.
它们破坏肠壁
They disrupt the lining of your gut
以破坏诸如C​​CK之类的方式激素
in a way that disrupts things like CCK
破坏适当的饱腹感信号
and proper satiety signals.
它们包含一堆东西 尤其是糖
And they contain a bunch of things, in particular sugars,
还有其他的东西
but other things as well,
不仅破坏荷尔蒙系统
that disrupt not just the hormonal systems
还破坏控制饮食欲望的神经系统
but also the neural systems that control the desire to eat
在吃完之后
after the diet is done.
所以有很多原因
So there's just so many reasons
为什么这些高度加工的食物很糟糕
why these highly processed foods are terrible,
他们可以解释很多不良的健康影响
and they can explain a lot of the ill health effects
我们在过去50年中看到的
that we've seen in the last 50 years
不仅在美国 而且在世界各地
not just in the United States, but all over the world.
都显示出糖尿病 青少年糖尿病的巨大增加
That enormous increase in diabetes, juvenile diabetes.
非常显著
It's just remarkable
我们在节食这条路上已经走了那么远
how far down the path of diet we've gone.
很明显 这几乎像是一支吸烟枪
And it's clear, it's almost a smoking gun
那是什么原因造成的
what the cause of this is.
如果你想进一步了解
If you'd like to learn more about that
请参阅Lustig的讲座
please refer to the Lustig lecture.
他还阐明了为什么非加工食品
He also spells out why non-processed foods
要经济得多
is far more economical in terms of
就家庭  个人
just at the level of the household or individual
以及社会层面而言
as well as at the societal level.
真的很有趣
Really interesting stuff,
我强烈建议你去看一下
I highly recommend you check it out.
所以现在让我们继续研究其他激素
So now let's move on to some other hormones
调节饥饿感和饱腹感 尤其是胰岛素
that regulate hunger and satiety, in particular insulin.
那么  你可能以前听说过胰岛素
Now, you've probably heard of insulin before.
胰岛素是I型糖尿病患者所缺乏的
Insulin is the thing that's lacking in type I diabetics,
这就是为什么他们每次进食时都必须注射胰岛素
that's why they have to inject insulin whenever they eat.
他们必须这样做的原因是因为他们吃饭时
The reason they have to do that, is because when they eat
他们的食物分解成葡萄糖
their foods are broken down into glucose.
为了运输葡萄糖
And in order to shuttle glucose
到身体上适当的组织
to the appropriate tissues in the body,
并且为了控制血糖水平 你需要胰岛素
and also to keep glucose levels in check, you need insulin.
所以考虑胰岛素和葡萄糖的最简单方法
So the simplest way to think about insulin and glucose
是当你吃东西时 食物被分解成糖
is that when you eat, that food is broken down into sugars,
无论是脂肪还是糖 这都是事实
that's true whether or not it's fats or it's sugars,
或最终是蛋白质
or eventually if it's proteins,
正如我们所说 它们被氧化成燃料
they are oxidized into fuels as we say.
那些燃料可以被使用
And those fuels can be used
顾名思义 燃料意味着能量
as the name fuel implies into energy,
它们最终被制成ATP
they're eventually made into ATP.
那里有很多生化步骤
There's a bunch of biochemical steps there
我们今天不讨论
we're not going to go into today,
但这实质上就是它的工作方式
but that's essentially how it works.
你把食物分解成葡萄糖
You break down food into glucose.
那么  如果你是生酮饮食
Now, if you're ketogenic,
我们将稍作讨论
we'll talk about that in a little bit.
但总的来说 你吃的食物会变成葡萄糖
But in general, you eat, food is turned into glucose.
让你的血糖需要保持在特定范围内
Your blood sugar needs to be kept in a particular range.
低血糖意味着太低 高血糖意味着太高
Hypoglycemic means too low, hyperglycemic means too high.
他们称之为正常血糖EU 血糖
And what they called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
是健康范围
is the healthy range.
那么  这健康范围是多少呢
Now, what those healthy ranges are,
一般而言 健康范围 正常血糖范围
in general the healthy range, the euglycemic range,
每分升约为70至100纳克
is about 70 to a hundred nanograms per deciliter.
但是你们大多数人都没有
But most of you aren't walking around
随身带着葡萄糖监测仪
with a glucose monitor.
你们中有些人可能会 但大多数人不是
Some of you are, but most of you are not.
对于我们现在要解决的更重要的问题
The more important question for us to address right now,
这就是为什么
is why is it important
葡萄糖保持在特定水平很重要？
that glucose be kept at a particular level?
一旦了解了这一点 就要检查血糖
Once you understand that, keeping glucose in check
开始有其背后的理由
starts to have a rationale behind it
并且这样做的方式变得更加有意义
and the ways to do that start to make a lot more sense.
所以原因是 如果血糖水平过高
So the reason is, if glucose levels get too high
因为我们的细胞特别是神经元的方式
because of the way that our cells in particular neurons,
与葡萄糖相互作用
interact with glucose,
高水平的葡萄糖会损害神经元
high levels of glucose can damage neurons.
它实际上可以杀死神经元
It can actually kill them.
你可以开始获取所谓的外周神经
You can start getting what are called peripheral, excuse me, neuropathies.
某些形式的糖尿病的症状之一
One of the symptoms of some forms of diabetes
就是人们开始失去触摸的感觉
is that people start losing the sensation of touch
在他们的手指 手或脚上
in their fingers or their hands or their feet,
他们会开始失去感觉
and they can start going blind.
有糖尿病性视网膜病变
There's diabetic retinopathies.
所以这很重要
So it's very important,
胰岛素可以控制你的血糖水平
that insulin manage your glucose levels.
那么  还有II型糖尿病
Now, there's also type II diabetes
通常患者的胰腺是分泌胰岛素的
where there's insulin secreted from the pancreas,
但是患者对胰岛素不敏感
but people are insulin insensitive.
受体被破坏
There's a disruption in the receptors
这与没有胰岛素
and insulin insensitivity isn't quite the same
完全不同
as having no insulin at all,
但有某些相同的机制
but it parallels some of the same mechanisms.
那么  I型糖尿病会经常被发现
Now, type I diabetes is often picked up
因为某人突然体重减轻
because someone has a sudden weight loss,
因为他们不像以前一样
because they're not processing blood sugar
能够加工血糖
the same way they were before.
II型糖尿病通常是
Type II diabetes is often,
虽然并不每次都是这样   但是通常与超重
although not always associated with being overweight
肥胖有关
and with obesity.
两者都是具有很难的情况
Both of them are challenging conditions.
II型糖尿病几乎总是可以控制的
Type II diabetes almost always can be managed
通过控制体重
by managing one's weight.
当然还有一些处方药和补品
And of course there are prescription drugs and supplements
可以帮助管理这些
that can help manage those.
我们将讨论所有这些
We're going to talk about all of that.
但是对于大多数没有糖尿病的人来说
But for most people that don't have diabetes,
重要的是要控制葡萄糖
the important thing is to manage glucose,
使其保持在正常血糖范围内
to keep it in that euglycemic range.
并且有许多不同的方法可以做到这一点
And there are a number of different ways to do that.
其中有些是行为举止 有些是基于饮食的
Some of them are behavioral, some of them are diet based,
其中一些是基于补品
and some of them are based on supplements
或处方药
or prescription drugs.
因此 现在让我们谈谈这些
So let's talk about those now.
因此 如果你吃东西 尤其是如果吃碳水化合物
So if you eat, and in particular if you eat carbohydrates,
血糖上升
blood glucose goes up.
如果你吃脂肪 血糖升高的程度要小得多
If you eat fats, blood glucose goes up to a far less degree.
如果你吃蛋白质 取决于蛋白质
And if you eat proteins, depending on the protein,
最终将被分解为燃料
it will eventually be broken down for fuel
或组装成氨基酸链以进行蛋白质合成
or assembled into amino acid chains for protein synthesis
并修复其他组织和身体功能
and repair of other tissues and bodily functions.
但是葡萄糖也会上升 然后保持在范围内
But glucose goes up and then is kept in range.
饥饿时会分泌一种不同的激素
When you are hungry, you secrete a different hormone
叫做胰高血糖素
and that's called glucagon.
胰高血糖素的主要作用是拉动能量储存
And glucagon's main role, is to pull stores of energy
从肝脏和肌肉中分离出来
out of the liver and the muscles.
一旦这些被耗尽
And once those are depleted,
你最终会吸收体内脂肪 好吧
you'll eventually tap into body fat, okay?
所以 这是对于那些
So, and this is for people
具有正常的血糖范围的人的
that have a typical blood glucose range,
也就是血糖范围在70至100之间的人
so that 70 to 100 euglycemic range.
因此 两种推拉系统
So, the two kind of push and pull systems
我们现在要考虑一下以保持这一简单性
that we're going to think about now to keep this simple,
是你有管理葡萄糖的胰岛素系统
is that you have the insulin system managing glucose,
胰高血糖素系统
and you've got the glucagon system
从肝脏和肌肉中抽出能量
pulling energy out of your liver and muscles
立即加油
for immediate fuel.
最终你会从体内脂肪中抽出燃料
And eventually you'll pull fuel out of body fat
如果你已经活动了很长时间
if you've been active for a very long time
你所有的糖原储量都枯竭了
and all your glycogen stores are depleted
或接近耗尽
or close to depleted.
那么 这意味着什么？
So what does this all mean?
这之中有很多重要的生物化学
There's a lot of important biochemistry
还有很多重要的细胞在工作
and a lot of important cellar processes
参与你的同化或分解代谢
involved in whether or not your anabolic or catabolic.
你是否正在分解物质
Whether or not you're breaking things down
或合成物质
or building things up.
但是 让我们讨论以一种更简单的方式进行进食
Let's talk about feeding in a simpler way, however.
让我们来编织管理血糖的工具
And let's weave the tools to manage blood glucose,
保持检查状态 就像我们那样做
to keep it in check, as we do that.
所以 假设你吃过饭
So, let's say you had a meal
那顿饭是米 碳水化合物
and that meal consisted of rice, a carbohydrate,
一些肉或鱼 比如说一块鲑鱼
some meat or fish, let's say a piece of salmon,
还有一些蔬菜 一些纤维状蔬菜
and some vegetable, some fibrous vegetable
像芦笋 白菜或类似的东西
like asparagus or cabbage or something like that.
如果你要一次吃所有这些
If you were to eat all of that at once,
你咬一口 另一口
you know, you take a bite of one, a bite of the other,
你将把它混合起来
you're going to mix it up.
这些食物 最终都到了同一个地方
You know, one of these, it all ends up in the same place
它们会混在一起
kind of people, mix it all up.
然后你会经历胰岛素的增加
Then you'll experience an increase in insulin
并增加血糖
and increase in blood glucose
速度适中
that's moderately fast.
它会迅速增加
It's going to increase pretty quickly.
其中非常惊人的事情是
What's remarkable,
你消耗每种宏观营养素的顺序
is that the order that you consume each macro-nutrient
对胰岛素的升高速度
has a pretty profound influence on the rate of insulin
葡萄糖分泌到血液中的速度
and glucose secretion into the blood
这些上升的速度  有非常深远的影响
and how quickly those levels rise.
因此 如果你将使其变得非常简单
So if you will make it really simple.
如果先吃米饭
If you were to eat the rice first,
你的葡萄糖会急剧上升
your glucose would rise in a sharp spike,
特别是如果它不包含任何需要减慢吸收的脂肪
especially if it doesn't contain any fats to slow the absorption.
那么  如果你非常饿
Now, that might be good if you're very hungry
而你想增加葡萄糖  那可能会很好
and you want to get an increase in glucose.
其实这就是原因
In fact, this is the reason
为什么经常在饭前吃面包 因为它是...
why you're often served bread before meals, because it is...
有时是面包和黄油
And sometimes it's bread and butter,
饭前或开胃菜或薯条
or chips before meals or appetizers,
旨在使你的血糖升高
are designed to get your blood glucose going up high
因为血糖急剧上升
because big steep increases in blood glucose
倾向于促进消耗更多葡萄糖的欲望
tend to promote the desire to consume more glucose.
这也与多巴胺系统有关
And this also relates to the dopamine system
以及口中是否美味
and the way that something tasty in the mouth
肠中有糖 口中有脂肪和糖
and sugar in the gut and fats and sugars in the mouth,
触发大脑中许多系统的激活
trigger the activation of a lot of systems in the brain
身体消耗更多你所拥有的
and body to consume more of whatever you have
或任何现有的东西
or whatever is available to you.
所以 基本思想是  如果先吃碳水化合物
So, the basic idea is that eating carbohydrates
和/或一餐中的脂肪
and/or fats early in a meal
会使血糖急剧上升
will give a steep rise in blood glucose.
但是 如果你先吃纤维的东西
However, if you were to eat the fibrous thing first,
咀嚼很多 但是血糖却没有大的上升
so a lot of chewing, but not a big rise in blood glucose
因为总的来说...
because in general there's...
除非它与糖在一块儿
Unless it's laid in with sugar.
或我们正在谈论的东西
Or something we're just talking about
一些蔬菜 纤维蔬菜
some vegetable, fibrous vegetable,
这实际上会钝化葡萄糖的释放
that will actually blunt the release of glucose
直到你吃了鱼和米饭
until you eat the fish and the rice.
但信不信由你
But believe it or not
它实际上会抑制吃大米引起的
it will actually blunt the glucose increase
葡萄糖的增加
that the rice would cause.
那么  我不是在谈论
Now, I'm not talking about
神经兮兮地  把每种常量营养素
neurotically eating each macro-nutrient
依次分开来吃
separately in sequence.
我只是想给你一个整体概念
I'm just trying to give you a picture
通常发生的是什么
of what's happening ordinarily.
所以这意味着
So what this means is,
如果你感到很多与食物有关的焦虑
if you feel a lot of food related anxiety,
或者你觉得自己是这些人之一
or you feel you're one of these people
你可以感觉到
that you can kind of sense
比如你的血糖上升非常快
like your blood sugar increasing very quickly,
很多人可以感觉到 有些人则不能
a lot of people can sense this, some people can't,
跟每个人的血糖管理水平有很大关系
has a lot to do with how well they manage their blood sugar
以及一些心理因素
as well as some of the psychological factors.
是的 跟家庭和历史原因有很大关系
And yes, their family and historical reasons,
你知道 我有一些有很多兄弟姐妹的朋友
you know, I've got friends who had a lot of siblings,
当他们坐下来吃饭时
and when they sit down to eat
他们必须克制住自己
they have to really suppress the desire
才能不跟桌上其他人抢吃的
to not beat up everyone else at the table and take all the food.
有点像...
It's sort of like not...
他们很难理解
It's hard for them to understand
东西是够吃的
that there's plenty to go around,
因为他们的成长过程就是那样
because of their upbringing.
因此 存在自上而下的心理影响
So there are psychological top-down effects.
关于食物的很多心理学
A lot of the psychology around food
旨在使人们在进食时放松身心
is geared towards getting people to be relaxed when they eat
还有这类事情
and these sorts of things.
但是这些血糖作用只是细胞的作用
But these blood sugar effects are real just cellar
和基本的生物化学
and basic biochemistry
身体如何管理摄入血液的糖分
of how the body manages sugars ingested into the blood.
那么 这意味着什么？
So what does this all mean?
这意味着如果你想急剧增加葡萄糖
It means that if you want a steep increase in glucose,
你非常非常饿
you are very, very hungry,
那么你应该先吃掉食物中的碳水化合物
then you should eat the carbohydrate laid in food first,
或者 你应该同时食用大量的常量营养素
or you should eat a bunch of macronutrients combined.
比如说汉堡包或三明治
So that would be like the hamburger or the sandwich,
面包 三明治中的所有东西
the bread, the whatever's in that sandwich altogether,
通常也包括蛋白质和蔬菜
usually that's protein and vegetables as well.
如果你想增加适度的血糖
If you want to have a more modest increase in glucose
或者你想抑制葡萄糖的增加
or you want to blunt the increase in glucose,
然后至少要有一些纤维
then have the, at least some of the fibrous thing first,
然后是蛋白质 然后是碳水化合物
and then the protein and then the carbohydrate.
你会注意到你的血糖
You will notice that your blood glucose
会更稳定地上升
will rise more steadily,
而且你会在餐前更早地达到饱腹感
and that you'll achieve satiety earlier in the meal.
至少你不会经历一个巨大的血糖高峰
Or at least you won't get this huge peak
有点像感恩节大餐
at sort of the Thanksgiving meal effect.
一部分观众可能在国外
Some of you are international,
你可能不庆祝感恩节
so if you don't celebrate Thanksgiving
那是在一年中的某个时候...
is a time of year where...
一年一次或一年两次
It used to be the one-time a year or two times a year
美国人会允许自己
where Americans would give themselves permission
吃大餐的时候
to eat enormous meals.
那么  这种情况似乎经常发生
Now that seems to happen a lot more often.
但是这种影响是  你吃饱了
But there is this effect of you're full
但是你渴望更多
and yet you're hungry for more,
那是因为你的血糖已经到了顶峰
that's because your blood glucose has gone through the roof
并且触发了许多其他机制
and it's triggered a number of other mechanisms.
通常也有大量的酒精摄入
There's also usually a lot of alcohol consumption,
和酒精本身 因为它是糖
and alcohol itself because it's a sugar
会非常非常急剧地增加血糖
will increase blood glucose very, very sharply.
取决于酒精
It depends on the alcohol,
有些酒精比其他酒精含有更多的糖
some alcohols have more sugar than others.
但是基本上你想避免的是
But basically what you're trying to avoid
血糖急剧上升
are steep increases in blood sugar.
和你吃食物的顺序
And the order that you eat foods
对此产生了巨大的影响
has an enormous impact on that.
产生巨大影响的另一件事
The other thing that has an enormous impact
影响葡萄糖的曲线
on how long and shallow,
多长  多浅  或有多陡峭
or how steep that curve of glucose is,
取决于你最近是否在动
depends on on whether or not you recently were moving,
吃完饭后开始动或之前在移动
are moving or start moving after you eat.
结果证明你的血糖水平
So it turns out that your blood glucose levels
可以通过运动  非常非常有力地进行调制
can be modulated very, very powerfully by movement.
如果你做任何剧烈的运动
If you did any kind of intense exercise,
甚至只是步行或慢跑
or even just walking or jogging,
或在吃东西之前骑自行车
or cycling anything before you eat
你的血糖水平会有所降低
your blood glucose levels will be dampened somewhat.
这与释放所谓的东西有关
And that has to do with the release of something called,
有人称它为GLUT4 听起来像...
some people call it GLUT4, which sounds like glutton.
也有人发音为GLUT4
Other people call it GLUT4.
这些都是参与运输葡萄糖
These are things that are involved in shuttling glucose
到体内的特定细胞
to particular cells in the body,
即针对肌肉和糖原存储
namely toward muscle and glycogen stores
并远离脂肪储存处
and away from body fat stores.
它与从血液中隔离葡萄糖有关
It has to do with sequestering of glucose from the blood.
关键是 如果你
The point is that, if you're somebody
在血糖调节方面苦苦挣扎
who struggles with blood sugar regulation,
除了使体重处于健康范围之外
in addition to getting your body weight in a healthy range,
做所有其他事情
doing all the other sorts of things
你应该做的
that you should be doing,
关键是要尝试一些动作
the key thing is to try and get some movement,
有时作为巡回餐
sometime as circuit meal.
那么  很少有人
Now, very few people
可以同时吃饭和走路
can actually eat and walk at the same time,
尽管我一直都这样做
although I do it all the time.
不是因为我要调节血糖
Not because I'm trying to regulate my blood sugar
但是只是因为我经常很忙
but just 'cause I tend to be busy.
我吃饭开车 忙着...
I eat and drive, [mumbles] busy.
如果我不播这个播客
Busy if I'm not giving this podcast,
那我可能在睡觉 在吃东西
or if sleeping, I'm eating,
除了我的窗口期
but except the early part of the day when I fast.
但最重要的是
But the bottom line here is that,
例如 如果你在用餐后步行30分钟
if you, for instance take a 30 minute walk after a meal,
你的血糖会以有益的方式
your blood glucose will be blunted
被钝化
in ways that are beneficial.
如果你在饭前的几个小时内锻炼过身体
If you have exercised in the recent hours before a meal,
那可能是有益的
that can be beneficial.
你食用食物的顺序是有益的
The order that you consume foods is beneficial.
而且 你可以吃一些东西
And there are a few things that you can consume
来调节血糖水平
that can also adjust blood glucose levels.
因此 让我们谈谈这些
So let's talk about those,
但我认为重要的是要夯实
but I thought it was important to really tamp down
不只是吃什么
that it's not just what you eat,
我们之前谈到过
we talked about that before,
还有吃这些东西的顺序
but also the order that you eat those things,
信不信由你
believe it or not,
无论你是否结合大量营养素
whether or not you combine macro-nutrients,
碳水化合物 蛋白质 脂肪和纤维状蔬菜
carbohydrates, proteins and fats and fibrous vegetables.
以及你最近是否有运动
And whether or not you've moved recently.
运动强度越高
The higher intensity the movement,
GLUT4增加得越大
the greater the GLUT4 increase,
而且血糖会变钝
and the more that the blood glucose will be blunted
你会把更多的血糖运输到糖原
and you'll shuttle more of that to glycogen
和肌肉储存上
and muscle stores.
甚至饭后运动
And even just moving after a meal,
即使只是一个轻松的步行
even just a calm easy walk,
真的可以让血糖更好地调节
can really adjust the ways in which blood sugar regulated for the better.
我不想在这种加工食品上坚持不懈
I don't want to perseverate on this processed foods,
隐藏着糖的东西太多了
hidden sugars thing too much.
但是现在了解
But understanding now
关于胰岛素和葡萄糖的工作原理
a little bit about how insulin and glucose work,
你可能可以想象为什么隐藏的糖
you can probably imagine why hidden sugars
从加工食品制造商的角度来看
are such an attractive thing
是如此吸引人的东西
from the standpoint of processed food manufacturers.
因为如果他们可以把糖放进去 那你甚至都不会尝到
Because if they can put sugar in that you can't even taste,
糖会增加你体内葡萄糖的量
that sugar is going to amplify the amount of glucose,
它会增加葡萄糖的增加速度
it's going to increase the rate of glucose increase
进入你的血液
into your bloodstream
它将促进更多的进食
and it's going to promote more feeding.
因此 在那种情况下 真的是落入了圈套
So in that case, you're really being tricked.
不是说你真的要
It's not that you're actually reaching
去吃额外的开胃菜
for the additional appetizer
并且你的血糖上升
and your blood glucose is going up.
你吃的食物
The food that you ate
实际上可以在你进食时增加食欲
is actually increasing your appetite as you eat it.
这是一个积极的反馈回路
It's a positive feedback loop.
所以不想再妖魔化那些我已经说过的东西
So don't want to demonize those any more than I already have,
但你应该知道这些事情正在发生
but you should be aware that these things are happening
在你的血液和大脑的水平
at the level of your bloodstream and brain.
我想谈谈另一件事
The other thing I'd like to address for a moment,
这是稳定血糖的概念
is this notion of stable blood sugar
相对于放置胆汁血糖或不稳定血糖
versus lay bile blood sugar or unstable blood sugar.
有些人只是血糖稳定
Some people just have stable blood sugar.
他们可以长时间不吃东西
They can go long periods of time without eating
而且感觉还不错
and feel fine.
别的人就会身体不支 开始发抖
Other people get really shaky, really jittery,
当他们吃东西时 他们会觉得自己很紧张
and/or when they do eat, they feel really keyed up.
有时他们甚至会出汗
Sometimes they'll even sweat.
有时他们的视线会变得模糊
Sometimes their vision will go blurry.
其中一些实际上可能是
And some of that can actually be
因为他们已经成为高血糖患者
because they've become hyperglycemic.
以及你所经历的那些
And those effects that you experience
血糖过高时的影响 预警信号是
when you are hyperglycemic are the early warning signs
损害神经元的各种事物
of the kinds of things that damage neurons
并导致真正可怕的东西
and lead to the really terrible stuff
他们像周围神经一样谈论过
they talked about before like peripheral neuropathies.
那么  这些事情要花一些时间
Now, it takes some time for those things to occur,
这些神经疾病的发生
those neuropathies to occur.
但是血糖是否到处都是
But whether or not your blood sugar is all over the place
或是否稳定
or whether or not stable,
可能会受到许多因素的影响
can be impacted by a number of things.
这些事情之一就是运动
One of those things is exercise.
所以这些天有很多兴趣
So these days there's a lot of interest
在他们所谓的第 zone-2 有氧运动
in what they call zone two cardio,
就是那种有氧运动的稳态
which is that kind of steady state cardio,
可以鼻呼吸的地方
where you can just nasal breathe
即使输出很高
even at pretty high output,
在这里你可以进行对话
where you could maybe have a conversation.
虽然我强烈赞同
Although I'm such a huge proponent
运动期间鼻呼吸
of nasal breathing during exercise,
大多数运动形式 特别是zone-2 有氧运动
most forms of exercise especially zone two cardio,
在做有氧运动时
that you probably shouldn't be talking
你可能不应该说话
while you're doing that cardio
除非绝对必要的对话
unless it's absolutely essential.
但是zone-2 有氧运动的时期
But periods of zone two cardio
持续30分钟到一个小时
that lasts anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour
或有时更多的耐力运动员
or sometimes more for your endurance athletes,
可以对血糖调节产生积极影响
can create positive effects on blood sugar regulation,
这样你就可以坐下来享受其中的一切
such that you people can sit down and enjoy whatever it is,
热软糖圣代
the hot fudge sundae,
或任何含糖量高的食物
or whatever the high sugar content food is.
而且血糖管理非常好
And blood glucose management is so good.
你的胰岛素敏感性非常高 这是一件好事
Your insulin sensitivity is so high, which is a good thing,
你可以控制血糖
that you can manage that blood glucose
到真正不能让你动摇的地步
to the point where it doesn't really make you shaky,
它不会打扰你正常生活
it doesn't disrupt you.
而且 与体重有关的问题更不用说了
And you know, to say nothing of the weight-related issues
或肥胖的脂肪等等
or the adipose fat gain, et cetera,
那是一个单独的问题 因为那里的人们各不相同
that's a separate issue because people vary there.
但基本上 zone-2 有氧运动要进行30到60分钟
But basically doing zone two cardio for 30 to 60 minutes,
一周三到四次
three to four times a week
才能使你的血糖真正稳定
makes your blood sugar really stable,
出于各种原因 这是一件有吸引力的事情
and that's an attractive thing for a variety of reasons.
另一方面 高强度间歇训练
On the flip side, high intensity interval training
或阻抗训练  又称重量训练
or resistance training AKA weight training,
擅长刺激各种分子
are very good at stimulating the various molecules
促进糖原的重新包装
that promote repackaging of glycogen.
冲刺 举重 循环举重
So sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting
只要有一定程度的阻抗
provided there is some reasonable degree of resistance,
那些会触发的机制是各种各样的
those are going to trigger are all sorts of mechanisms
会鼓励身体
that are going to encourage the body
将葡萄糖转运回糖原中
to shuttle glucose back into glycogen,
转化为糖原 转化为肌肉组织
converting to glycogen, into muscle tissue,
重新储存肝糖原等
restock the liver, et cetera.
消耗一个人的糖原实际上需要一些时间
Depleting one's glycogen actually takes some time.
如果你做几套三头肌扩展
You know, if you do a couple sets of tricep extensions
有一些收缩 你并没有耗尽糖原
and some crunches, you're not depleting your glycogen.
糖原消耗训练 的强度非常大
Glycogen depleting workouts are very high intensity.
通常他们不到一个小时左右
Generally they're less than an hour or so,
但是那是那种
but those are the sort
将导致各种酶和代谢途径
that are going to lead to big increases
大幅增长的运动
in the kinds of enzymes and metabolic pathways
它将重新包装糖原并运送大多数东西
that are going to repack glycogen and shuttle most things
恢复食物
towards restorage of foods
不进入脂肪组织 不变成脂肪
not into adipose tissue, not into fat,
但摄取葡萄糖并将其转化为燃料
but taking glucose and making it into fuels
储备好 你之后可以用
that you can access later
进行更多的高强度活动
for more of that high intensity activity.
我要提到的优势之一
And I should mention that one of the advantages
高强度间歇训练
of high intensity interval training
或各种举重
or weightlifting of various kinds,
是因为它会让基础代谢率
is that it causes long standing increases
长期提高
in basal metabolic rate.
我不想讲的太多
I don't want to go too far down this path
因为我们之后要做整整一个月的播客
because we're going to do an entire month
将对人类表现和运动表现的影响
on human performance and athletic performance.
不仅是肌肉的增加
But it's not just the increases in muscle
增加新陈代谢 因为肌肉燃烧更多的能量
that increase metabolism, because muscle burns more energy
比其他类型的组织
than other types of tissues,
除了你的大脑 它真正消耗了最多的能量
except your brain, which truly burns the most energy.
反正是主要原因
Anyway is the main reason
为什么你的基础代谢率是原来的水平
why your basal metabolic rate is what it is.
好吧 高强度训练
Well, high-intensity training.
所以可能是冲刺
So it could be sprints,
可能是高强度间歇训练
it could be high intensity interval training
不同种类的 可能是重量训练
of different kinds, it could be weight training,
也有增加生热的作用
also has an effect of increasing thermogenesis
甚至在完成练习后很长时间
even long after you've completed the exercise.
所以有一段很长的余热
So there's a long tail.
运动后有一种新陈代谢作用
There's a kind of post exercise metabolic effect
这也是有益的
that's also beneficial.
所以它不是“可能”
So it's not an either or,
真的是要高强度间歇训练
it's really that high intensity interval training
和抵抗训练
and resistance training.
出于某种原因 这种事情非常好
And things of that sort are very good for one reason.
而由于其他原因 Zone2有氧运动也非常好
And the zone two cardio is very good for other reasons.
现在你可以明白为什么这只是健康的事情
And now you can see why it's just a healthy thing
以及为什么大多数人应该在一周中的大多数日子中做运动
and why most people should probably be doing exercise
如果不是一周中的每一天
most days of the week, if not every day of the week.
如果你的目标是控制血糖
If your goal is to manage blood glucose
你的目标是管理一些新陈代谢的因素
and your goal is to manage some of the metabolic factors
控制糖原的重新包装
that control repackaging of glycogen
并努力让多余的葡萄糖
and encouraging excess glucose
不转移成为人体脂肪存储
to not get diverted into body fat stores.
今天我们关于脂肪的讨论不多
We haven't talked a lot about lipids today,
这是因为今天大多数讨论都与荷尔蒙有关
that's because most of today's discussion is about hormones
胰岛素是
and insulin is the dominant hormone
在调动和控制体内葡萄糖方面的主要激素
in terms of mobilizing and managing glucose in the body,
至少对于大多数人来说是这样
at least for most people.
但是脂肪很重要
But fats are very important.
还有一些关于脂肪的轶事
And there's just a little anecdote about fats
我认为这对思考很有用
that I think will be useful in thinking
关于为什么要管理
about why you want to manage
他们称为LDL或HDL比率
what they call the LDL or HDL ratios.
这值得一整集
And this is deserving an entire episode,
很多 甚至几集
many, perhaps even several episodes.
但是你们当中有些人可能熟悉LDL和HDL
But some of you may be familiar with LDLs and HDLs,
你们中有些人可能不知道是什么
some of you may not.
LDL是低密度脂蛋白
The LDL is low density lipoprotein.
这是你不希望它过高的一种脂蛋白
This is the one that you don't want it to be too high.
Costallo在做梦 他在叫
Castillo's dreaming, he's barking.
他爱各种形式的胆固醇
He loves all forms of cholesterol
但这只是Costallo的梦
but that's just Castillo dreaming.
因此 LDL是你想要保持较低的水平
So LDLs are the ones that you want to keep low.
你不希望这个物质的水平过高
You don't want those to go excessively high.
HDLs 高密度脂蛋白
HDLs, the high density lipoproteins
是所谓的健康脂蛋白
are the ones that are the so-called healthy lipoproteins.
一切都很好
That's all fine and good.
但是你可能会问自己 它们 的功能是什么？
But you might ask yourself, what are they doing?
这些东西的实际作用是什么
What is the actual role of these things,
为什么要健康水平的HDL
and why would you want healthy levels of HDL
而不是太多的LDL？
and not too much LDL?
嗯 原因之一是
Well, one of the reasons is,
脂肪不溶于水 对不对？
that fats don't like water, right?
它们是疏水的
They are hydrophobic.
但是你需要在血液中移动脂肪
And yet you need to move fats in your bloodstream,
人体所有组织都需要脂肪
all tissues in your body need fats.
他们需要胆固醇 它们是...
They need cholesterols, they're...
在上一集中 我们谈到了胆固醇
In last episode we talked about cholesterol
是性类固醇激素的前体
is a precursor to the sex steroid hormones,
雌激素 以及睾丸激素和其他激素
estrogen, and testosterone and other hormones as well.
好吧 HDL和LDL实际上可以包裹脂肪
Well, HDL and LDL, actually coat fats
使它们能够通过血液运输
to allow them to be transported through the bloodstream.
他们也做很多其他事情
They do a number of other things as well.
但是HDL是运输脂肪的系统的关键组成部分
But HDL, is a key component of the delivery system
这个系统把那些脂肪带到肝脏 卵巢
that brings those fats to the liver, ovaries,
睾丸和肾上腺
testes, and adrenals.
换句话说 拥有足够水平的HDL是件好事
In other words, having adequate levels of HDL is good,
因为它让脂肪被输送到组织
because it allows fats to be delivered to the tissues
制造睾丸激素 雌激素
that manufactured testosterone, estrogen,
皮质醇的健康水平和肝脏
cortisol in healthy levels and the liver.
这就是为什么当LDL太高时
So this is why when LDLs are too high
会发生的事情是
what's happening is you're not getting fats
该胖的地方不胖
to the correct tissues.
你会积聚脂肪
And you can get buildup of fats
比如脂肪肝
like fatty liver disease
而且其中某些事情可能会发生
and some of these things can happen.
糖含量高
A high sugar content
甚至会导致某些脂肪肝疾病
can even lead to some of these fatty liver conditions
那开始发生
that starting to happen
实际上是人类历史上的第一次
is actually the first time in human history perhaps
无论如何我们都知道
that we're aware of anyway.
我们开始看到肝脏疾病
That we're starting to see liver conditions
之前通常只与严重酗酒有关
that normally were associated only with severe alcoholism
现在开始来自含糖量
starting to come from sugar content.
那么这是什么意思？
So what does this mean?
这意味着你得关注并保持你的LDL和HDL比率正确
This means keep your LDL and HDL ratios proper.
你需要那些HDL来传递脂肪分子
You want those HDLs in order to deliver fatty molecules
到使用胆固醇的组织
to the very tissues that use cholesterol
为了制造激素
in order to manufacturer hormones.
那么如何使LDL和HDL保持适当的比例呢？
So how do you keep LDLs and HDLs in their proper ratios?
好吧 很多人没有意识到这一点
Well, a lot of people don't realize this,
但是关于饮食中胆固醇的争论
but the debate about dietary cholesterol
及其与低密度脂蛋白和高密度脂蛋白比率的关系
and its relationship to LDL and HDL ratios,
这是一场持久的辩论
it is a barbed wire debate.
我现在不想参加到其中
I don't want to get into it right now.
因为仍然有很多悬而未决的问题
There are still a lot of open questions
关于饮食中胆固醇的多少
as to how much dietary cholesterol
影响LDL和HDL比率
impacts LDL and HDL ratios.
我现在不想讲这个
I don't want to get into that now,
我都不采取任何立场
I'm not taking a stance either way.
但是很清楚的事
But what is very clear,
血糖高度升高的人
is that having highly elevated glucose,
他们摄入了太多的糖
consuming too much sugar
或无法控制体内的葡萄糖
or not managing glucose in your body
通过一些机制
through some of the mechanisms
直到现在我们一直在谈论
that we've been talking about up until now,
这会对LDL HDL比率产生负面影响
can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
因此 控制葡萄糖水平远远超出了
So managing glucose goes way beyond
控制血糖
just managing blood sugar,
还要确保你不会过多摄取体内脂肪
and making sure that you don't lay down too much body fat,
确保你的新陈代谢保持高水平
making sure your metabolism stays high
并确保你在用餐时不会感到紧张
and making sure you're not getting jittery at meals.
这也与
It also has to do with
确保你创建了足够的分子HDL
making sure that you're creating enough of the molecules HDL
并且没有太多的LDL
and not too many of the molecules LDL,
将会破坏事物的传递
that are going to disrupt the delivery of things
到你的身体器官
to the organs of your body
阻止你的睾丸激素水平保持健康水平
that allow you to make healthy levels of testosterone,
影响雌激素等
estrogen, and so forth.
如果不清楚 那么让我简化一下
If that wasn't clear, let me make this ultra simple.
你需要健康的HDL水平
You want healthy levels of HDL,
而且要低水平的LDL
and you want low levels of LDL,
因为如果你有卵巢
because if you have ovaries
它将允许到达卵巢的脂肪
it will allow the fats that need to get to the ovary
产生雌激素 到达那里
to produce estrogen, to get there.
如果你有睾丸 它将允许脂肪
And if you have testes, it will allow the fats
和你需要的胆固醇分子
and the cholesterol molecules that you need
到达睾丸后 能够制造睾丸激素
in order to manufacture testosterone to get to the testes.
同样 为了具有适当的肾上腺功能
As well, in order to have proper adrenal function
和适当的肝功能
and proper liver function,
你希望HDL和LDL处于正确的健康水平
you want HDL and LDL in the healthy correct levels.
所以现在我们已经讨论了很多行为工具
So now we've talked a lot about behavioral tools
以及潜在的生物学机制
and the underlying biological mechanisms
在特定情况下证明这些工具是合理的
that justify those tools in particular circumstances.
那么  我想谈谈补充剂和处方药
Now, I'd like to turn to supplements and prescription drugs
调节荷尔蒙系统
that regulate the hormone systems,
控制进食和饱腹感
controlling feeding and satiety.
其中有很多
There are a huge number of these.
有些具有比其他更强大的效果
Some have more powerful effects than others.
我想描述两个
There are two that I want to describe
因为最近它们受到了很多关注
because they've been getting a lot of attention recently.
首先 有一种处方药二甲双胍
First of all, there's a prescription drug Metformin,
被开发为治疗糖尿病的药物
which was developed as a treatment for diabetes.
它有效地降低了血糖
And it works potently to reduce blood glucose.
它在降低血糖方面具有显著作用
It has dramatic effects in lowering blood glucose.
二甲双胍涉及线粒体作用的改变
Metformin involves changes to mitochondrial action
在肝脏中
in the liver.
这是消耗或减少血糖的主要方法
That's its main way of depleting or reducing blood glucose.
它是通过所谓的AMPK途径实现的
And it does so through the so-called AMPK pathway,
并且整体上增加了胰岛素敏感性
and it increases insulin sensitivity overall.
二甲双胍是一种功能强大的药物
Metformin is a powerful drug.
其实我很惊讶这么多人
In fact, I'm surprised that so many people
考虑到大多数人
have sought it out, given that most of the people
我知道所寻求的不是糖尿病
that I'm aware of that sought it out are not diabetic.
我认为对于糖尿病患者来说 这似乎是一种有用的药物
I think for diabetics it seems to be a useful drug.
对于非糖尿病患者 当然也可以
For non-diabetics, it can also of course,
降低血糖
lower blood glucose.
它还具有使人们降血糖的潜力
It also has the potential to make people hypoglycemic,
真正降血糖
genuinely hypoglycemic.
因此 你确实需要谨慎使用二甲双胍
So, you really need to approach Metformin with caution.
我有点担心
I get a little concern
当我听到有人疯狂摄入二甲双胍时
when I hear about people blasting Metformin,
仅仅是因为禁食状态或低血糖状态
simply because fasted states or low blood sugar states
原本是健康的
are healthy.
药理学上这样做会产生长期影响
Doing that pharmacologically can have long standing effects.
你确实需要谨慎处理该药物
You really want to approach that with caution.
那么  有一种可比的药物
Now, there's a comparable drug,
它真的应该被称为"药品"
it really should be called a drug.
但这不是处方
But it's non-prescription,
在那里也有相当突出的用途
that's also in fairly prominent use out there
叫黄连素 对
called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct.
因此 黄连素是一种非常有趣的化合物
So berberine is a really interesting compound.
它的作用非常类似于二甲双胍
Its actions very much mimic Metformin.
因此 让我们再谈一谈黄连素
So let's talk about berberine for a second.
小碱实际上来自各种植物和树皮
Berberine actually comes from various plants and tree bark.
它在补品商店中出售 在网上出售
It is sold in supplement stores, it's sold online.
据我所知 它是强大的
It is, as far as I know unregulated, it is powerful.
如果你要尝试使用黄连素
If you're going to experiment with berberine,
你肯定想和你的医生谈谈
you definitely want to talk to your doctor
并且你要谨慎处理它
and you want to approach it with caution.
它还可以激活所谓的AMPK途径
It also works to activate the so-called AMPK pathway.
AMPK代表
AMPK by the way stands for
腺苷单磷酸激活蛋白激酶AMPK
Adenosine Monophosphate-activated protein kinase, AMPK.
并且它抑制蛋白质酪氨酸磷酸酯的1B途径
And it inhibits a protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway.
行了 说够了不说了
I think that's enough nomenclature.
它会激活某种途径
It activates a certain pathway
与空腹和低血糖有关
that's associated with fasting and low blood glucose.
据我所知 黄连素的作用是
The effects of berberine are as far as I can tell,
当看文献时 会发现
when looking at the literature,
它与二甲双胍非常相似
are very similar if not identical to Metformin.
那么  对此的研究数量很多
Now, the number of studies out there on this are many.
所以我将要回顾其中的一些
So I'm just going to review a few of them
及其主要影响
and their major effects.
与往常一样 我邀请你检查一下examine.com
As always, I invite you to check out examine.com.
这是一个很棒的网站
It's a wonderful website
你可以在其中添加任何补充剂或化合物
where you can put in any supplement or compound
或生物学目标
or biological goal for that matter.
它将列出各种效果
And it will list out the various effects
在人类效应矩阵中
in the human effect matrix.
因此 如果有的话 对人类进行研究
So studies on humans, if they're available.
它会告诉你它们是否有效
And it will tell you whether or not they're strong effects
或微弱的影响或适度的影响
or weak effects or modest effects.
它将指向特定的受试者人群
And it will point to the specific subject population,
这是一个很棒的资源
it's a wonderful resource.
因此 黄连素在降低血糖方面具有很强的作用也就不足为奇了
So berberine, not surprisingly has very strong effects in lowering blood glucose.
对此有四项研究
There are four studies on this.
实际上 他们说黄连素是其中一种
In fact, they say that berberine is one of the more
非常有效的当作降低血糖的补品
if not the most effective supplements for lowering blood glucose.
它谈论那里的剂量
It talks about dosages there.
尽管我只会提到我尝试了黄连素
Although I'll just mention that I've tried berberine,
和瓶子上的典型剂量
and the dosages that are typical on the bottle
大多数补品中的含量都比我需要的要高得多
of most supplements, is much higher than I needed.
所以当我服用黄连素时 发生了两件事
So when I took berberine, two things happened,
首先 我头痛欲裂
first of all, I got a pretty splitting headache.
这让我头疼得厉害
It gave me pretty vicious headache.
所以对我来说几乎是立即不行
So for me it was a no, almost immediately.
另一件事是 我变得血糖不足
The other thing is, I became so hypoglycemic.
为了使我的血糖回升
That in order to get my blood sugar back up,
我想我吃了10个甜甜圈
I think I ate something like 10 donuts
而且我不觉得自己摄取了那么多糖
and I didn't feel like I had ingested all that much sugar.
真的很奇怪
It was really kind of weird.
我食糖过多
I was hyperphagic for sugar.
我非常渴望糖 渴望糖
I was craving sugar, craving sugar
而且我也很口渴
and I was very thirsty as well.
因此 我不想提倡任何不良行为
And so, I don't want to promote any bad behavior,
但我知道某些人会使用这个
but I know that certain people use this
当他们吃糖过多时
when they've overeaten sugars
或者他们正在cheating day
or they're doing their cheat days,
我个人不喜欢这个做法
something that I'm personally just not a fan of.
他们想控制血糖
And they want to keep their blood sugar in check
或者他们知道自己要吃一顿大餐
or they know they're going to consume a huge meal.
他们会服用黄连素来保持血糖水平
They'll take berberine to keep blood glucose clamped.
它确实做到了
And it does do that.
它具有非常强的作用
It has very strong effects.
三项同行评议的HbA1c水平研究
Three peer reviewed studies on HbA1c levels.
HbA1c是可以在血液测试中测量的东西
HbA1c is something that can be measured in a blood test.
那是过去的两三个月里
That is sort of an average readout
血糖水平的
of your blood sugar levels
平均值
over the previous two or three months,
有时会更短
sometimes shorter period.
但这主要是HbA1c的目的
But that's mostly what HbA1c is about.
因此 它可以从根本上降低你的血糖水平
So, it radically decreases your blood sugar levels.
它实际上降低了胆固醇
It actually lowers cholesterol.
它会记住肝脏
It acts remember on the liver,
肝脏参与胆固醇代谢
and the liver is involved in cholesterol metabolism.
记住 这都是糖 血糖
And remember it's both sugars, blood glucose,
和饮食脂肪
and dietary fats.
也许市面上关于这个的话题仍在激烈辩论中
Perhaps it's still heavily debated
就血液中的总胆固醇
in terms of how your blood total cholesterol
是否会限制HDL和LDL水平这个问题
HDL and LDL are regulated.
似乎是降低了总胆固醇
So it seems to lower total cholesterol,
似乎同时降低了HDL和LDL
and it seems like it lowers HDL and LDL in parallel.
这很有趣
So that's interesting.
一项研究显示HDL略有增加
One study showed a minor increase in HDL,
也就是所谓的好胆固醇
the so-called good cholesterol.
然后胰岛素水平下降 不足为奇
Insulin levels dropped, not surprising.
另一项研究表明LDL略有下降
Another study showed a slight decrease in LDL,
虽然似乎是次要的
though seem to be kind of minor.
这是一种有趣的事情
Here's a kind of interesting one,
只是为了帮助你记住黄连素
just to help you remember berberine
由于它来自树皮
as of the fact that it comes from tree bark,
这可能并不能让你足以记住它
isn't trigger enough to remember it.
但如果说黄连素去直接接触溃疡疮
Direct contact of berberine on canker sores
似乎可以很快消除溃疡疮
seems to eliminate canker sores very quickly,
这很酷
which is kind of cool.
几年来我没有溃疡疮
I've not had canker sores in a few years
但是当我患上的时候 会非常痛
but when I dig down, they're extremely painful.
我不喜欢那些
I don't like those.
所以这很有趣
So that's kind of interesting,
那里有一些研究参考
and there's some study references there.
我发现这些化合物的存在令人惊讶
I find it amazing that these compounds exist.
你有这种处方药二甲双胍
You've got this prescription drug Metformin,
然后有黄连素 这是树皮上的东西
and then you've got berberine, this stuff from tree bark,
而且它们的效果基本上是等价的
and they have effects that are essentially equivalent to one another.
再说一次 我不提倡使用它们
So again, I'm not promoting their use
甚至只是尝试
or even their exploration,
但是那些化合物确实存在 它们在那里
but those compounds do exist, they're out there.
如果你想了解更多信息 请访问examine.com
And check out examine.com if you'd like to learn more.
当然 你可以阅读 做好相关准备
Certainly do your reading, do your homework,
在开始之前 请说明
before you start just popping the stuff.
如果你患有低血糖或高血糖症
And if you have hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia,
要特别小心 也要了解剂量
be especially careful and also do understand that dosages
剂量要求各不相同
and dose requirements vary.
所以如果你想要用这些物质
So if you do go down this path,
请认真对待事情
really approach things carefully.
一律以最低用量开始
Always start with the lowest amount
你可以马上停止的剂量
that you could get away with.
对我来说 头痛的事使它一去不复返
For me, the headache thing just made it a no-go.
我确实保留了一瓶完整的信息
I do keep a bottle of it in a full disclosure,
偶然的机会
in the odd chance
我觉得自己想吃很多甜甜圈
that I feel like eating a ton of doughnuts.
不摄取卡路里的意义不大
It's not so much about not ingesting the calories,
只是我不喜欢这种感觉
it's just that I don't like the feeling
血糖过高
of being hyperglycemic,
视线模糊 感觉很糟糕
the blurry vision, just feeling lousy,
我喜欢甜甜圈
I do love donuts.
其他以补充剂形式影响血糖的物质
Other things that impact blood glucose in supplement form.
铬在29项研究中已显示出微量元素
Chromium has been shown in 29 studies to have a minor,
我想强调一点对降低血糖的作用
I want to emphasize a minor effect on reducing blood glucose.
左旋肉碱
Things like L-carnitine,
我们之前在播客上讨论过的物质
something we've talked about here on the podcast before
就其与ATP之间
in terms of its relationship
为ATP生产提供动力的这种关联
to power output in ATP production
对于有氧运动和无氧运动
for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise,
以及精子质量和卵子质量
as well as sperm quality and egg quality.
我们早就谈论过了
We talked about that long ago.
人参等东西可以对人产生积极影响
Things like Panax ginseng can have positive effects on,
我应该说 会有效果
I should say, can have effects
降低血糖的效果
of reducing blood glucose slightly.
我不想评判这种效果
I don't want to give a valence to or judgment
是正面还是负面的
to whether or not it's positive or negative.
这很有趣
Here's something that's interesting
你应该知道的
that you should know about.
咖啡因已被非常可靠地证实
Caffeine has very reliably been shown
会增加一点点的血糖 好吧
to increase blood glucose just a little bit, okay?
但是我一直以为咖啡因会降低血糖
So I always thought that caffeine would drop blood glucose,
但实际上可以稍微增加血糖
but it actually can increase blood glucose just slightly.
像镁一样的东西
Things like magnesium.
我们谈到过镁
We talked about magnesium
作为补剂 是帮助睡眠的工具
as a tool for enhancing the passage into sleep,
特别是苏糖酸镁和双甘氨酸盐
in particular magnesium threonate and bisglycinate.
镁还可以使血糖适度降低
Magnesium can also have a modest reduction in blood glucose.
你只是想获得印象
You're just trying to get the impression,
一切都会降低血糖
everything reduces blood glucose,
但事实并非如此
but that's certainly not the case.
然后几集前
And then a couple episodes ago
当我们讨论营养时
when we were discussing nutrition
我们谈到了人造甜味剂三氯蔗糖
we talked about artificial sweeteners, sucralose,
阿斯巴甜 NutraSweet
aspartame, NutraSweet.
其中一些是通用名称
Some of those are generic names.
其中一些可能是品牌名称
Some of those might be brand names
以及它们如何对肠道微生物组产生负面影响
and how they have negative effects on the gut microbiome
这得到了许多研究的支持
and that's supported by a number of studies.
有一种人造甜味剂 是甜叶菊 甜叶菊
There's one artificial sweetener, it's stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A,
似乎只是稍微降低了血糖
which seems to lower blood glucose just slightly.
而且我仍然找不到数据
And I still can't find data
甜叶菊是否会影响肠道微生物组
on whether or not Stevia impacts the gut microbiome
在任一方向上
in either direction.
我吃的许多东西
Many of the things that I consume
里面确实有少量的甜叶菊
do have small amounts of Stevia in them.
所以我很想知道是否有人
So I'd love to know if anyone out there
有了解到有相关的高质量的同行评审研究
is aware of quality peer reviewed research,
甜叶菊是否会影响肠道微生物组
as to whether or not Stevia impacts the gut microbiome
与其他人造甜味剂相似或不同
similarly or differently from other artificial sweeteners.
如果有人知道 请告诉我
Please let me know.
请给我参考
Please send me the references.
我真的很感激
I'd really appreciate it
可以将其放在YouTube或其他地方的评论部分中
if put it in the comment section on YouTube or elsewhere.
YouTube上的评论部分将是最好的地方
Comment section on YouTube would be the best place.
因此 甜叶菊似乎会稍微降低血糖
So Stevia seems to lower blood glucose a little bit,
这使其成为一种有吸引力的人造甜味剂
which makes it kind of an attractive artificial sweetener
如果要使用人造甜味剂
if one is going to use artificial sweeteners.
但请记住 甜味本身
But remember, sweet taste itself
激发了进食的欲望
stimulates the desire to eat,
这将增加更多的血糖
which will increase more blood glucose.
所以我猜想他们可能会互相抵消
So I'm guessing that they probably cancel each other out.
因此 你必须从逻辑上考虑这些事情
So you have to think logically about these things.
维生素B3 所以一些B族维生素
Vitamin B3, so some of the B vitamins
确实刺激食欲
do indeed stimulate appetite
通过触发血糖升高
by triggering increases in blood glucose,
尤其是维生素B3
vitamin B3 in particular.
我不知道B6是否这样做
I don't know if B6 does.
锌之类的东西似乎可以降低血糖
Things like zinc seem to lower blood glucose.
然后还有很多其他物质
And then there've been an enormous number of other things
已经测试了它们在血糖中的作用
that have been tested for their roles in blood glucose.
苹果醋 任何酸性物质
Apple cider vinegar, anything acidic.
现在众所周知 任何一种酸度
This is well-known now that any kind of acidity,
可能是柠檬汁或酸橙汁
so it could be lemon juice or lime juice,
或苹果醋 可略微降低血糖
or Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
其中一些也可能有其他影响
Some of those can also have other effects
我们今天不再谈论了
that we're not talking about today.
所以这很有趣
So that's kind of interesting
因为现在有一阵狂热
because there's a movement now
人们谈论的话题
towards creating a sort of people talk about
变得更碱性 这些是什么...
becoming more alkaline, you know, what these...
我讨厌打破你的想法
I hate to break it to you
但你真的不能让自己的身体太碱性
but you don't really want your body to be too alkaline.
你想保持正确的pH值 否则就开始...
You want to stay in the right pH or else you're start...
有一些环境是会使你变得更碱性
There are conditions that make you more alkaline.
你不想太酸或太碱性
You don't want to be too acidic or too alkaline.
如果你看到饮料或其他东西
If you see a beverage or something
声称摄取该饮料
that purports that ingesting that beverage
会让你更碱性
is going to make you more alkaline,
那绝对是错误的
that is absolutely false.
没有证据表明 从生化角度讲是不可能的
There's no evidence for that, is impossible biochemically.
这只是营销
It's just marketing.
但是仍然摄入酸性食物
But nonetheless ingesting foods that are acidic
可以对肠道的pH值进行一些微调
can make some slight adjustments to the pH of the gut
以可能减慢或改变食物吸收的方式
in ways that can slow or alter the absorption of foods
并且会钝化血糖
and can blunt blood glucose.
如果需要 你可以在某个时候尝试一下
You can try this sometime if you want,
如果你感觉有点过分紧张
if ever you're feeling kind of over sugared out
比如你吃了太多糖
like you ate something with too much sugar.
你可以喝少量柠檬汁
You can drink a small amount of lemon juice
与水或酸橙汁混合
mixed with water or lime juice,
而且你会注意到它会变钝
and you'll notice that it will blunt
那种高血糖作用只是一点点
that kind of hyperglycemic effect just a little bit.
同样 你不想将其用作医疗工具
Again, you don't want to use this as a medical tool,
但效果相当有效
but the effect is fairly potent.
然后
And then, excuse me.
然后还有很多其他物质
And then there are a number of other things
像辣椒素和辣椒
like capsaicin and hot chili peppers
会降低血糖
that will lower blood glucose.
这些物质不胜枚举
The list goes on and on,
最强大的是绝对的黄连素和二甲双胍
The most powerful one is absolutely berberine and Metformin,
但这真的是药效很强的东西
but that's really heavy caliber stuff.
我提到的其他物质影响较小
And the other ones I mentioned have more minor effects.
我想提一提 因为我敢肯定你们中的一些人
I do want to mention because I'm sure some of you out there
对生酮饮食感到好奇
are curious about the ketogenic diet.
我要录一整集关于生酮以及大脑和身体的播客
I'm going to do an entire episode about ketosis and the brain and the body,
但已有22项研究显示了生酮饮食
but the ketogenic diet has been shown in 22 studies
使血糖显着下降
to have a notable decrease on blood glucose.
这并不奇怪
And that is not surprising,
因为生酮饮食的本质
because the essence of the ketogenic diet
是你只摄入很少 或者几乎不摄入
is that you're consuming very little or zero
促进胰岛素和葡萄糖急剧增加的食物
of the foods that promote big spikes in insulin and glucose.
如果你摄入足够的蛋白质
If you consume enough protein,
某些蛋白质可以转化为葡萄糖
some of that protein can be converted into glucose,
当然是通过糖异生
of course, through gluconeogenesis.
但是生酮饮食有很强的
But the ketogenic diet has a very strong support
调节血糖（葡萄糖）的作用
for its role in regulating blood sugar, which is glucose.
但是生酮饮食的特定作用
But the specific effects of the ketogenic diet,
还有一个特效 我稍后再讲
and one particular effect that I'll address later
但我现在要提
but I'll mention now,
这就是生酮饮食的
which is, the ability of the ketogenic diet
调整甲状腺激素水平的能力
to adjust thyroid hormone levels
以使之成为
in ways that make it
这样 如果你重新吃碳水化合物
such that if you return to eating carbohydrates
酮症时间过长后
after being in ketosis for too long,
你也不能控制肌瘤和碳水化合物
you don't manage fibroid and carbohydrates as well,
也已经显示出来
that has been shown as well.
因此 我们将深入研究生酮
So we're going to dive deep into ketosis
在未来的一集中
in a future episode.
因此 对于你来说 ketonistas确实不用担心
So for you ketonistas does out there don't worry,
我当然没有反对生酮饮食
I certainly have nothing against ketogenic diet.
我什么都没说
I actually don't have anything
我没说反对任何特定的营养计划
for against any particular nutrition plan.
我知道它对我有用 至少在我生命的这个阶段
I know it works for me, at least at this stage in my life.
如果需要 我会对这些知识点进行更新
And I'll update it if I need to.
我只是想为你提供尽可能多的信息
I'm simply trying to get you as much information
尽我所能
as I possibly can,
这样你就可以浏览整个学术界
so that you can navigate through that landscape
与你的特定目标保持一致
in a way that's in keeping with your particular goals.
所以现在你对血糖有了很多了解
So now you understand a lot about blood sugar
及其管理方式
and how it's managed,
以及可以更好地管理它的方法
and the ways that you can manage it better
根据你的特定需求
depending on your particular needs.
这也是我们回顾的好机会
This is also a good opportunity for us to look back
在一些医学文献中
at some of the medical literature,
因为它确实指向我们已经走了多远
because it really points to just how far we've come
在理解这些重要机制方面
in terms of understanding these important mechanisms.
它为我们指明了方向
And it points us in the direction
一些可行的协议
of some actionable protocols.
因此 糖尿病 这就是血糖的巨大增加
So diabetes, which is these huge increases in blood glucose,
因为没有胰岛素
because there's no insulin,
早在公元前1500年就被人们所知
was known about as early as 1500 BC,
真是不可思议
which is just incredible.
然后医师了解的方式
And the way physicians then understood
某些人血糖高
that certain people had high blood glucose
在不知道血糖是多少的情况下
without actually knowing what blood glucose was,
是他们会吸收特定患者的尿液
is that they would take the urine of particular patients,
他们发现蚂蚁经常会朝着
and they'd find that ants preferably move toward
并消耗某些患者而非其他人的尿液
and consume the urine of certain patients and not others.
它们知道尿中有东西
And they understood that there was something in that urine
与减肥有关
that was correlated with the weight loss
和其他一些
and some of the other
可能是非常不幸的健康症状
probably very unfortunate health symptoms
这些人正在经历的
that these people were experiencing.
所以他们知道血液和尿液中有东西
So they knew that there was something in blood and urine.
但是你可能会问自己 等等 那是尿液
But you might be asking yourself, wait, that's urine.
但是我会告诉遇见的每个孩子 有两件事
But as I tell every kid that I meet, two things.
我告诉一个孩子 你的大脑在这里
I tell a kid, your brain is here,
我让他们指着他们的头
I make them point to their head.
然后我告诉他们 你知道吗？
And then I tell them, do you know what?
你知道你的尿液实际上是血液吗？
Do you know that your urine is actually filtered blood?
他们通常会
And they usually go, [grunts].
当然我提前获得了他们父母的许可
I get parental permission to do this first.
但是大多数成年人没有意识到
But most adults don't realize
你的尿液实际上只是过滤的血液
that your urine is actually just filtered blood.
这就是为什么如果你会看到尿液中有血液
And that's why if you see blood in your urine,
那便会是个问题
that's a problem.
你想过滤血液 但尿液就是过滤的血液
You want to filter the blood, but urine is filtered blood.
那么  这项从尿液中测量血糖的业务
Now, this business of measuring blood sugar from the urine
一直可以追溯到
has been something that lasted way beyond
公元前1500年的早期
these early stages of 1500 BC.
事实证明 直到1674年
It turns out that as late as 1674,
牛津大学的医生正在弄清楚
physicians at Oxford university were figuring out
血糖异常高的人
who had pathologically high levels of blood glucose
通过分析他们的尿液
by analyzing their urine.
再一次 他们正在测量尿液的甜度
And again, they were measuring the sweetness of their urine,
这是医学事实
and this is medical fact.
他们会这样做
They would do this
通过采集不同患者的尿液样本
by taking urine samples from different patients,
并品尝它们
and tasting them.
他们发展出一种直觉
And they developed an intuitive sense
什么是过甜的尿液
of what excessively sweet urine was
相对于他们品尝过的其他尿液
relative to the other urines that they had tasted.
所以对于那些从事医学专业的人
So for those of you that are in the medical profession
或那些正在寻求医学专业的人
or those of you that are seeking out the medical profession,
你知道这还不做吗？
do you understand this is not done anymore?
你也可以反思我们已经走了多远
And you can also just reflect on how far we've come
就医学专业而言
in terms of the medical profession itself.
在我们从血液中测量事物的能力
In our ability to measure things from the blood
并从尿液中测量东西
and measure things from urine
无需询问蚂蚁哪种尿液更甜
without having to ask ants which urine is sweeter
或问自己 哪种尿液更甜
or ask oneself, which urine is sweeter.
因此 的确 我们作为一个物种正在取得进步
So indeed we are making progress as a species.
在今天结束之前 我想谈谈另一种工具
Before we close out today I want to talk about one more tool
你们中的许多人可能会发现有用
that many of you will probably find useful.
我当然有 我是咖啡因的主要消费者
I certainly have, I'm a big consumer of caffeine,
虽然我没有喝的很多
although I don't consume a ton of it,
我一直在喝它
I consume it very consistently.
因此 我一直在喝Mate
So I'm big on consuming Mate,
这是一种含咖啡因的浓茶
which is a strong caffeinated tea.
我通常是在一天的早些时候喝
And I generally do that early in the day.
虽然我起床后会延迟约两个小时
Although I do delay about two hours after I wake up
由于我在上一集中提到的原因
for reasons I've talked about in previous episode,
保持警觉性和专注力
to maintain that nice arc of alertness and focus.
我也喝黑咖啡 蘑菇咖啡
I do drink black coffee as well, mushroom coffee as well,
我喜欢那个东西
I love that stuff.
但是Mate（也称为Yerba Mate）是一个有趣的化合物
But Mate, also called Yerba Mate, is an interesting compound
因为不像咖啡
because unlike coffee,
已经显示它可以增加称为胰高血糖素的物质
it has been shown to increase something called glucagon
像肽GLP1
like peptide GLP1.
并增加瘦素水平
And increase leptin levels.
那么  我们今天对胰高血糖素的讨论不多
Now, we didn't talk a lot about glucagon today.
胰高血糖素在禁食状态下确实会升高
Glucagon is really elevated in the fasting state.
我提到这与胰岛素相反
I mentioned that it's sort of the opposite of insulin
粗略地说
in kind of rough terms
那是考虑它的一种方式
that's one way to think about it.
但是GLP1或胰高血糖素样肽之一
But GLP1, or glucagon-like peptide one,
通过摄取Mate 这两种物质会增加
is increased by ingesting Mate
它可以很好地抑制食欲
and it acts as a pretty nice appetite suppressant.
那么  我并不是想抑制自己的食欲
Now, I'm not trying to suppress my appetite.
我喜欢像我之前提到的那样吃东西
I like to eat as I mentioned before.
但是它真的可以很好地刺激大脑
But it works really well to stimulate the brain
并给你一定的警觉性
and to give you a level of alertness
并同时有很多咖啡的功效
and to do a lot of the things that coffee does.
它还包含电解质
It also contains electrolytes.
所以我们的意思是我们的神经元和我们的大脑
So we meaning our neurons and our brain
受多种因素影响
run on a variety of factors,
电活动和化学传递等
electrical activity and chemical transmission, et cetera,
但他们需要足够水平的钠钾
but they require adequate levels of sodium potassium
和镁
and magnesium.
所以 如果你要学习生物学
So, if you were to learn the biology
或动作电位的生理学
or the physiology of the action potential,
发射神经元
the firing of a neuron,
我们每隔一年就会向神经科学专业的学生教授一些东西
something we teach every first year neuroscience student,
如果你有兴趣 我很乐意教你
and I'd be happy to teach you if you're interested.
你会听到钠冲入细胞
You'll hear about sodium rushing into cells
钾进入和离开细胞
and potassium entering and leaving cells
为了让神经元交流
in order to allow neurons to communicate.
电解质至关重要
Electrolytes are critically important
对于神经系统的功能很重要
for the function of the nervous system.
还有很多利尿剂
And many things that act as diuretics,
促进咖啡因等水的排泄
that promote excretion of water, like caffeine,
也可以带走电解质
can also take electrolytes out along
特别是钠
with in particular sodium.
有时头昏眼花
And sometimes the lightheadedness
或人们经历的脑雾
or the brain fog that people experience,
不只是因为电解质含量低
isn't just because electrolytes are low
但是因为它们有点不平衡
but because they're kind of out of balance.
所以我喜欢Mate 因为它含有电解质和咖啡因
So I like Mate because it has electrolytes, it has caffeine.
它刺激这种胰高血糖素样肽的释放
It stimulates the release of this glucagon-like peptide
GLP1 对我有很大帮助 GLP1
and it's been a big help to me
在延长清晨的空腹时间
in extending that early morning fasting window
当我吃第一顿饭时大约要到中午
out to about noon or so when I eat my first meal.
它的味道也真的很好
It also just tastes really good.
我不是从葫芦里喝出来的
I don't drink it out of the gourd
即使我有阿根廷血统
even though I have Argentine lineage.
葫芦对我来说只是一种不便
The gourd to me it's just kind of an inconvenience,
我用杯子喝
I drink it out of a mug.
这里没有推荐 无广
There's no promotion here.
我与任何Yerba Mate种植园或公司 都没有利益关系
I have no relationship to any Yerba Mate plantations
我只是碰巧真的很喜欢这些东西
or companies, I just happen to really like the stuff.
胰高血糖素样肽之一被富集的事实
And the fact that glucagon-like peptide one is enriched
或喝Mate时释放的更多
or is released more when you drink Mate.
GLP1可以调节血糖的事实
And the fact that GLP1 can regulate blood sugar
以保持血糖的方式
in ways that keep your blood sugar
因为我们称其为正常血糖
in that we called euglycemic,
不太高 不太低的模式
not too high, not too low mode,
是摄取Mate对我有吸引力的原因之一
is one reason why ingesting Mate is attractive to me.
如果你去南美
If you go to South America,
好吧 你会特别在俄勒冈人中看到
well, you'll see especially among Oregonians,
还有阿根廷人 实际上大家都会
but also Argentines, is people actually carry
带着冲好这个东西的热水瓶
a thermos of this stuff with them around
并带到餐厅用餐
and bring it to meals in restaurants.
这只是文化习俗
And it's just considered cultural convention,
看到这一点并不罕见
it's not unusual to see that.
所以我们在美国看不到那么多
So we don't see that so much here in the States
但是我碰巧真的很喜欢这个东西
but I happen to really love this stuff.
我自己酿造
I brew my own,
因为这是最经济的方式
because that's the most economical way to do it.
我真的很喜欢
And I really enjoy it.
对于某些人来说可能有点苦
It can be a little bitter for some people.
如果你想知道其中的诀窍
The real key there if you want to know,
种植Mate的诀窍是不要用水
the Mate trick is to not use water
真的很热
that's really boiling hot.
你真是胆怯
You go just shy of boil
然后就没有像这样的烟草味道
and then it doesn't have that same kind of tobacco like
或真正的酸性味道
or really acidic flavor to it.
虽然不是很甜 但还是有点甜
It's just a little bit sweeter, although not quite sweet.
因此 Yerba Meta GLP1可以以健康的方式进行管理
So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage in healthy ways
瘦素水平 葡萄糖水平和胰高血糖素水平
leptin levels, glucose levels, and glucagon levels
如果它可以为你服务 那么你可能想尝试一下
in ways that if it serves you, that you might want to try.
因此 我们再次涵盖了大量的材料
So once again, we covered an enormous amount of material,
专注于荷尔蒙如何调节进食 饥饿
focused on how hormones regulate feeding, hunger,
当一个人觉得他们不需要吃饭时
and when one feels they don't need to eat,
所谓的饱腹感  也就是你吃饱了
so-called satiety, that you've had enough.
一如既往 我们涵盖了很多 但我不能穷尽
As always, we covered a lot, but I could not be exhaustive
关于与该主题有关的所有信息
about all the information related to this topic.
真是太浩大了
It's just so vast.
例如 我们没有谈论甲状腺激素
For instance, we did not talk about thyroid hormone,
极为重要的激素和途径
an extremely important hormone and pathway
在身体和大脑中
in the body and brain.
我们要做一个与甲状腺有关的发作
We are going to do an episode related to thyroid
我保证 还有调节甲状腺的工具
and tools to regulate thyroid, I promise.
看了这个播客
Having seen this episode,
你将能够更轻松地消化该材料
you will be able to digest that material with far more ease.
我们也没有谈论以下事实
We also didn't talk about the fact that
睾丸激素和雌激素会影响血糖
testosterone and estrogen can impact blood glucose
以彼此相反的方式
in ways that are opposite to one another.
当雌激素水平高的时候
That when estrogen levels are high,
食欲会降低
appetite tends to be reduced.
当睾丸激素水平高时
When testosterone levels are high,
食欲趋于增加
appetite tends to increase.
所以有各种各样有趣的相互作用
So there are all sorts of interesting interplays
各种激素之间
between the various hormones.
但这是现在的深度探索
But that's too much of a deep dive of now.
那么  我们今天主要集中在
Right now, we've just focused today mainly
在生长素释放肽之类的东西上
on things like ghrelin, on things like,
黑色素细胞模拟激素
Melanocyte simulating hormone,
令人难以置信的强大激素 可以抑制食欲
incredible powerful hormone that can suppress appetite.
在肠道产生的胆囊收缩素之类的东西上
On things like Cholecystokinin that comes from the gut
并能抑制食欲
and can suppress appetite.
在食品乳化剂上
On things like food emulsifiers.
在吃饭的时候
On the fact that when you're eating
你是在寻找氨基酸
you are amino acids seeking,
即使你可能没有意识到
even though you might not realize it.
你也在寻找特定的脂肪酸
That you are also seeking out particular fatty acids
特别是共轭亚油酸和Omega-3
in particular, the conjugated linoleic acids and Omega-3's.
因此 我尝试为你提供了许多可行的工具
So I've tried to give you a number of actionable tools.
他们中许多人行为举止
Many of them behavioral.
其中一些是基于补品
Some of them are based on supplements
甚至处方药
or even prescription drugs.
再说一遍 总是做对你的健康最有益的事情
Again, always do what's best for your health,
并与医疗保健专业人员一起进行
and do that in company with a healthcare professional.
我不是医生 我什么都没开
I'm not a physician, I don't prescribe anything.
我是教授 我自称很多东西
I'm a professor, I profess a lot of things.
我尝试与你分享我认为最好的东西
And I try and share with you what I think to be the best
高质量的同行评审文献
high quality peer reviewed literature.
这就是我今天要做的
So that's what I've done today.
真的很感谢你的时间和意图
Really appreciate your time and intention.
你们中的许多人继续问
Many of you have continued to ask
如何帮助支持播客
how you can help support the podcast.
我们真的很感谢这个问题
And we really appreciate the question.
有几种方法可以做到这一点
There's several ways to do that.
首先是喜欢你看过的视频
The first is to like a video that you've seen
如果愿意 请订阅YouTube频道
if you like it, and please subscribe to the YouTube channel.
那也许是最重要的
That's perhaps the most important thing
