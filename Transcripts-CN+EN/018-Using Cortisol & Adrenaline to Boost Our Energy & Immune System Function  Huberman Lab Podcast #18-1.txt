我一直很喜欢做血液检查
I've long been a fan of doing blood tests
最近  由于已经开发出DNA检测技术
and more recently as they've been developed also DNA tests.
原因是很多因素
And the reason for that is that so many of the factors
影响我们的即时和长期健康
that impact our immediate and longterm health
并告知我们的健康选择
and that inform our health choices
只能通过血液或DNA测试进行分析
can only be analyzed by way of blood or DNA tests.

vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
自2012年以来  我一直在参加运动果岭比赛
I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.
因此  我很高兴他们赞助播客
And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
我开始服用运动果岭
I started taking Athletic Greens
而且我还是每天运动一次或两次
and I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day
因为它涵盖了我所有的营养  维生素  矿物质
because it covers all my nutritional, vitamin, mineral
和益生菌的基础
and probiotic basis.
当然  你可以获得维生素和矿物质
Of course, you can get vitamins, and minerals,
和食物中的益生菌
and probiotics from food,
但是包括我在内的我们很多人都很难做到这一点
but many of us including me find it hard to do that
在一致的基础上
on a consistent basis.
尤其是在我工作很多的时候
Especially when I'm working a lot,
当压力和睡眠没有得到优化时  等等
when stress and sleep aren't optimized, et cetera.
与运动果岭
With Athletic Greens
我确保得到我需要的所有东西
I make sure to get all the things I need
然后我服用的所有其他补品或所吃的东西
and then all the other supplements I take or what I eat
我可以考虑额外的保险
I can consider additional insurance.
运动绿色的伟大之处在于它的味道很棒
The great thing about Athletic Greens is it tastes great.
我喜欢把我的和水混合
I like to mix mine with water
还有一点柠檬汁
and a little bit of lemon juice.
我一天早上吃一次
I take it once early in the day
然后有时又在下午
and then sometimes again in the afternoon.
它包含益生菌的事实
The fact that it includes probiotics
对我来说真的很重要
is really important to me.
现在有太多数据指向事实
There are so many data now pointing to the fact
益生菌和肠道大脑健康
that probiotics and gut brain health,
肠道健康通常对新陈代谢非常重要
and gut health generally are very important for metabolism,
用于激素输出  用于神经递质的产生
for hormone output, for neurotransmitter production,
太多与我们的健康有关的重要事物
so many vital things related to our health,
运动果岭可以轻松确保
Athletic Greens makes it easy to make sure
我得到了我需要的一切

今天的一集也由Headspace带给了我们
Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
顶空是一种冥想应用程序  可简化冥想过程
Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.
我很多年前开始冥想
I started meditating many years ago,
但是我发现很难保持一致
but I found it was difficult to stay consistent
与我的冥想练习
with my meditation practice.
事实上  当我感到压力或非常忙碌时
In fact when I would get stressed or really busy
那时候我可能需要
that's when I probably needed
冥想练习最多
the meditation practice the most.
那就是我倾向于放弃冥想练习的时候
And that's when I tended to drop the meditation practice
并四处奔波做其他事情
and run around doing other things.
因此  这确实是一个陷阱22
So it was really a kind of catch 22.
几年前我了解了顶空
I learned about Headspace a few years ago
当他们将它们包括在内时  乘坐捷蓝航空的航班
on Jet Blue Flights when they had them included
作为是否看电影的一种选择
as an option of whether or not to watch a movie,
或电视节目  或冥想
or a television show, or do meditation.
我尝试了冥想  我真的很喜欢它
I tried the meditation and I really liked it.
顶空冥想非常容易遵循
Very easy to follow along with a Headspace meditation.
他们在“顶空”应用程序中包含的冥想
The meditations that they include on the Headspace app,
也得到了数十位同行评审的支持
are also backed by dozens of peer reviewed
质量独立研究
quality independent studies.
当然  现在有成千上万
And of course there are now thousands
同行评审的质量研究
of peer reviewed quality studies
指向一个事实  冥想练习
pointing to the fact that a meditation practice
为了改善睡眠是有益的
is beneficial for sake of improved sleep,
为了减轻压力
for reducing stress,
以及许多其他健康指标
and a number of other health metrics,
心血管疾病  风险等
cardiovascular disease, risk, et cetera.
顶空的伟大之处
The great thing about Headspace
能让我保持真正的一致性吗
is it's allowed me to stay really consistent
与我的冥想练习
with my meditation practice.
他们的冥想时间不同
They have meditations of different duration
和不同的类型  所以你永远不会感到无聊
and different type, so you never get bored.
我真的很期待我的冥想练习
I actually look forward to my meditation practice
它继续使我受益
and it continues to benefit me.
实际上  自从启动Headspace以来
In fact, since starting Headspace,
我已经很长时间地与冥想保持一致
I've been consistent with meditation for much longer
比我以前有过
than I ever had previously.
如果你想尝试顶空
If you want to try Headspace
你可以去headspace.com/specialoffer
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer
你将获得一个月的免费试用
and you'll get a free one month trial
拥有Headspace完整的冥想库

对于每种情况
for every situation.
那是headspace.com/specialoffer
That's headspace.com/specialoffer
获得一个月的免费试用
to get one month free trial,
那是目前他们最好的报价
that's their best offer out there right now.
然后你可以尝试他们完整的冥想资料库
And then you can try their full library of meditations
对于每种情况
for every situation.
今天  我们将继续关于激素的讨论
Today, we're going to continue our discussion about hormones
我们将专注于特定的荷尔蒙
and we're going to focus on how particular hormones
影响我们的能量水平和免疫系统
influence our energy levels and our immune system.
那么  我最后提到的最后一集
Now, last episode I mentioned at the end
我们结束了“激素之月”
that we were concluding our month on hormones,
但我们决定安可一下 多加一集
but we decide to include this additional episodes,
所以这是第五集
so this would be the fifth episode
在有关激素的作用系列中
in the sequence of episodes about hormones.
因为有两种至关重要的激素
Because there are two hormones which are vitally important
具有大量的生物学功能
for a huge number of biological functions
今天我们要谈一谈
that we will talk about today,
但这对能量水平
but that are particularly important for energy levels
和你的免疫系统特别重要
and your immune system.
这是我经常被问到的问题
This is something that I get asked about a lot.
因此  与其跳到下一个大主题
So rather than skip to the next general topic,
今天我们要谈论激素
today we're going to talk about the hormones
皮质醇和肾上腺素
cortisol and epinephrine also called adrenaline.
你不必听
You do not have to have heard
激素的前几集
the previous episodes on hormones
才能了解和消化今天的内容
in order to understand and digest the material
从今天的播客中
from today's podcast.
如果我提到与前几集有关的任何内容
If I mentioned anything related to previous episodes,
我保证会快速提供一些背景知识
I promise to give a little bit of quick background
使每个人都跟上节奏
to get everyone up to speed.
今天  我们将讨论皮质醇的生物学
Today, we're going to talk about the biology of cortisol.
我们将讨论肾上腺素的生物学
We're going to talk about the biology of epinephrine.
一如既往  我们将讨论机制
As always we'll talk mechanism
并且将会有很多工具
and there are going to be a lot of tools.
如果你是一个压力很大的人
If you're somebody who struggles with stress
能量水平很高的人
and energy levels,
那么平衡压力和能量水平
and balancing stress and energy levels,
今天的一集对你来说至关重要
today's episode is going to be vital for you.
如果你是一个在睡眠方遇到困难的人
If you're somebody who has challenges with sleep
或者你是一个没有办法
or you're somebody who has challenges
全天提高能量水平的人
getting your energy level up throughout the day,
想要睡觉时降低能量水平
and getting your energy level down when you want to sleep
今天的播客也适合你
today's episode is also for you.
我们将讨论免疫系统
And we're going to talk about the immune system
以及如何增强免疫系统的功能
and how to enhance the function of your immune system.
我们还将探讨一些有趣的话题
We're also going to get into some fun topics
与学习和记忆有关
related to learning and memory
以及如何利用皮质醇
and how you can leverage cortisol
特别是肾上腺素
and epinephrine in particular,
来让你学习更快
in order to learn faster.
我们将谈论所谓的益智药
we're going to talk about so-called nootropics,
智能药物及其作用方式
smart drugs and how they work,
因为有几个点
because there's several of them
直接关系到肾上腺素系统
that tap into the epinephrine system
但很少被讨论到
that aren't often discussed
并且你能够利用起来
and that you have access to.
我们要谈谈咖啡因的含量
We're going to talk about how caffeine
实际上可以使你的大脑好转或变坏
can actually rewire your brain for better or for worse.
我们将谈论“爽心美食”的生物学
And we're going to talk about the biology of comfort foods
以及它们为何如此出色  以及它们起的作用是什么
and why they work so well, and what they're doing.
并且在了解到那之后
And in understanding that
你将能够更好地了解你的食物选择
you'll be able to better understand your food choices
因为它们与短期和长期能源有关
as they relate to short-term and long-term energy.
所以我们有很多要讲的
So we have a lot to cover,
一切都会加上时间戳
everything will be timestamped.
我只想提醒人们  我们每集都会给字幕加上字幕
I want to just remind people that we caption every episode
用英语和西班牙语
in English and in Spanish.
字幕需要一两天才能在YouTube上弹出
The captions take a day or two to pop up on YouTube.
因此  如果你没有看到那些
So if you're not seeing those
在头几天之内
within the first couple of days,
请耐心等待我们
please be patient with us,
为了获得实际阅读的字幕
in order to get captions that actually read
与我所说的相似
similarly to what I'm saying.
我们通过字幕服务
we go through a captioning service,
所以我们由专家来完成
and so we have them done by experts
这需要一点额外的时间
and that takes a little bit of additional time.
同时  如果你有任何疑问
Meanwhile if you have any questions
随着播客的发展  请写下来
as the episode evolves please write them down.
请把它们放在评论部分
Please put them in the comment section.
如果你还没有订阅  请订阅该频道
Please subscribe to the channel if you haven't already,
让我们开始谈论
and let's get started talking about
如何增加精力
how to increase your energy,
并提高和增强你的免疫力
and improve and increase your immunity
通过利用皮质醇和肾上腺素的生物学作用
by leveraging the biology of cortisol and adrenaline.
在我们深入生物学之前
Before we dive into the biology
增加能量和免疫系统的能力
of increasing energy and your immune system,
我想讲三个主题
I want to cover three topics
我在前几集保证我之后会提到的
that I promised I would mention from previous episodes.
第一个涉及间歇性禁食
The first one relates to intermittent fasting.
第二个问题与你的胃咕噜咕噜叫有关
The second one relates to why your stomach grumbles.
上一次我忘记讲了其中的生物学
I forgot to mention the biology of that last time.
第三是增加生长激素的有力方法
And the third is a powerful way to increase growth hormone,
对增加新陈代谢有强大的作用
which is powerful for increasing metabolism,
脂肪燃烧和组织修复等
fat burning, and tissue repair, et cetera.
那不涉及桑拿
That doesn't involve a sauna
或用塑料袋包裹自己
or wrapping yourself in plastic bags
去慢跑
and going for a jog.
首先讲一下间歇性禁食
So first intermittent fasting.
上一集  我谈论了很多有关生长激素
Last episode I talked a lot about growth hormone
和甲状腺激素的话题
and thyroid hormone,
我提到了桑拿  运动和睡眠之类的东西
and I mentioned things like sauna and exercise, and sleep,
以及它们如何增加生长激素的水平
and how they can increase levels of growth hormone
在健康范围内
within the healthy ranges.
以及为什么增加生长激素会非常有益
And why increasing growth hormone can be very beneficial
因为它可以燃烧掉体内脂肪
because it can burn off body fat,
它可以改善肌肉和一般组织的健康状况
it can improve muscle and general tissue health,
软骨等
cartilage, et cetera.
我们往往会输
And we tend to lose,
或我们的生长激素水平随着年龄的增长而降低
or our levels of growth hormone are reduced as we age.
很多人问我
Many people asked me,
“好吧  禁食呢？”
"well, what about fasting?"
每个人都曾在社交媒体上声称
Everyone's been promised on the internet
间歇性禁食
that intermittent fasting
可以让生长激素大量增加
leads to these big increases in growth hormone.
我没有提及的原因
The reason I didn't mention it
是我找不到研究
is that I couldn't find a study
可以实际地指出其中潜在机制的
that actually pointed to the underlying mechanism.
我看到了很多主张  很多播客
I saw lots of claims, lots of podcasts.
带着很多学位的专家们
Lots of degrees behind people's names,
有时是生物学家
sometimes biologists,
有时完全不同的领域在谈论这个
sometimes entirely different fields talking about this,
但很少有研究
but very few studies.
然后  我找到了要考虑的研究内容
And then I found what I would consider the study.
我们将链接到此研究
We will link to this study.
事实证明  禁食确实会增加生长激素水平
Turns out that fasting does increase growth hormone levels
它的实现方式令人着迷
and the way that it does it is fascinating.
我在上一个播客中提到
I mentioned in a previous podcast
关于饥饿和用餐时间以及饥饿时间
about hunger and timing of meals and timing of hunger,
当你饿的时候
that when you're hungry
你会在体内释放一种叫做生长素释放肽的激素
you release a hormone in your body called ghrelin,
有时实际上称为ghrelin
sometimes actually called ghrelin.
谢谢你们所有的ghrelinisters
Thanks for all of you ghrelinisters, or ghrelinisters
纠正了我的发音
that corrected my pronunciation,
都是ghrelin 两者都可以读
it's both ghrelin or ghrelin, either one works.
Ghrelin让你饿
Ghrelin makes you hungry,
当你的血糖很低时
when blood glucose, your blood sugar is low,
饥饿素被分泌出来  使你饿了
ghrelin is secreted and makes you hungry.
事实证明  生长素释放肽
And it turns out that ghrelin,
这种饥饿激素实际上会结合
this hunger hormone actually binds
到大脑中的受体
to the receptor in the brain
通常会绑定所谓的
that normally binds what's called
生长激素释放激素
growth hormone releasing hormone.
所以信不信由你
So believe it or not the hunger hormone
可以像生长激素释放激素一样起作用
can act like growth hormone releasing hormone
从而刺激生长激素
and thereby stimulate growth hormone.
现在生长激素的水平
Now the levels of growth hormone
通过这种生长素释放肽系统促进禁食
that fasting promotes through this ghrelin system
相当丰富
are pretty substantial.
这是关于处于清醒状态时生长激素水平增加一倍
It's about a doubling of growth hormone levels
的情况
in the waking state.
因此  我们知道你可以在睡眠中释放生长激素
So we know that you can release growth hormone in sleep,
事实证明 间歇性禁食
intermittent fasting it turns out
可以增加生长激素
can increase growth hormone
通过将生长素释放肽与生长激素结合
by binding ghrelin to the growth hormone,
释放激素受体
releasing hormone receptor
而且白天也一样
and it does it also during the daytime.
所以是的  确实 禁食可以增加生长激素
So yes indeed fasting can increase growth hormone,
但不会特别多
not to the super levels
不像服用生长激素那样增加它
that taking growth hormone would increase it,
或桑拿那样增加它
or that a sauna could increase it,
但它确实会增加生长激素
but it does seem to increase growth hormone.
今天晚些时候
Later in today's episode
我们将谈论很多
we're going to talk a lot about
不同的禁食和进食方式
different patterns of fasting and eating
可以用来控制肾上腺素
that can control epinephrine.
因此  我们将讨论禁食多长时间的细节
And so we will turn to specifics about how long a fast.
你需要禁食两三天或二十三个小时吗？
Do you need to fast for two or three days, or 23 hours?
对于像我这样喜欢吃东西的人来说 有一个好消息
Fortunately for people like me who love to eat,
就是不需要这样子禁食
that's not the case.
因此  我们将讨论特定的禁食协议
So we'll talk specific fasting protocols
在播客的后面
later in the episode.
我们还说过  我们将谈论肚子咕噜叫
We also said, we're going to talk about tummy grumble,
当你的肚子叫的时候
when your stomach growls
这不是因为肚子里的流食在流动
it is not because of fluid sifting around in there.
很多人认为
A lot of people think,
哦  你知道那是流动的养分
Oh, you know it's fluid sifting around.
其实是 你的肚子
Turns out that your stomach
两侧有平滑的肌肉
has smooth muscle that lines it sides
当你吃东西或不吃东西时
and when you eat something or you don't
每隔一段时间你的胃就会紧绷
every once in a while your stomach cinches off
在两端像一个袋子
at the two ends like a bag
两端都有软管
with a hose on either end,
因为这实质上就是你的消化系统
'cause that's essentially what your digestive system is.
如果那里什么也没有
And if there's nothing in there what happens is
那么 腹部两侧的肌肉
the muscles that line the sides of your stomach
它们在胃周围延伸
they kind of extend around the stomach
和这些肌肉
and these cables,
这些总是在那里  如果你肚子里有食物
those are always there and if you have food in your stomach,
它们要做的是搅动你的胃
what they do is they churn your stomach.
它们实际上会改变你的胃部肌肉
They literally turn the muscles of your stomach
捏成一个不倒翁一样 来帮助分解食物
like a tumbler to help break up the food
大概你咀嚼得不够好
that presumably you didn't chew well enough
因为你吃得太快了
'cause you were eating too fast.
当你肚子里没有食物的时候
When you don't have any food in your stomach
搅动仍在继续
that churning continues.
肌肉的收缩
And that contraction of the muscle,
转弯  实际上是你的肌肉翻转
the turning, literally turning over of your muscles
它们不会完全翻身
they don't flip over completely,
但是翻过来的肌肉
but the turning over the muscles,
这就是引起胃部不适的原因
that's what causes the stomach growling.
如果你不想成为会议中
If you don't want to be the person in the meeting,
或坐在一个安静的剧院里
or sitting there at a in a quiet theater
肚子咕噜叫的很大声的那个人
whose stomach is growling,
好好咀嚼食物吧
chew your food better.
那是简单的解决方案
That's the simple solution.
最后一集  我谈论了很多关于桑拿的方法
And last episode, I talked a lot about how sauna,
控制下的安全热疗
controlled safe hyperthermia
会导致生长激素释放的大量增加
can cause huge increases in growth hormone release
从300到500%不等
anywhere from 300 to 500,
甚至增加了1600％的生长激素释放
even 1600% increases in growth hormone release.
确实是惊人的高增长
Really staggeringly high increases.
我指出很多人
I pointed out that many people
在院子或家中没有桑拿房
don't have saunas in their yard or in their homes,
他们将采取其他措施
and they would go through some other measures
安全地增加他们的身体热量
to increase safely their body heat.
在他们的浴室里建一个蒸汽室
You know, creating a steam room in their bathroom,
或多汗奔跑
or jogging with extra sweats on this kind of thing.
你们中的许多人都问过热水澡
Many of you asked about hot baths,
热袋会增加生长激素
hot bags will increase growth hormone,
但是你需要的温度
however the temperatures that you need
为了增加生长激素
in order to increase growth hormone
得足够高  而那样你就有烧伤的危险
are high enough that you run the risk of burn.
所以我真的无法提出任何建议
And so I really can't make any recommendations
关于热水澡
about hot bath,
但是如果你能忍受一个较高温的热水澡
but if you can tolerate a nice hot bath
你将释放一些生长激素
you are going to get some growth hormone release.
但是  桑拿浴室具有以下优势
However, the sauna has this advantage of
你能够进入175华氏度
you being able to enter 175 degree,
或200度的环境
or 200 degree environment,
前提是你没有怀孕
provided you're not pregnant,
你不是一个年幼的孩子  等等
you're not a young child, et cetera.
你可以安全地做到这一点
You can do that safely.
增加生长激素的大量增加
And getting big increases in growth hormone.
热水澡会导致
The hot bath will lead to
生长激素的增加较少
lesser increases in growth hormone.
未来播客中我们将谈论很多
We're going to talk a lot about
温度调节
temperature regulation in a future episode,
但是一如既往  如果你要
but as always if you're ever going to
开始玩热疗或体温过低的游戏
start playing with hyperthermia or hypothermia,
冷浴  冰浴  热水淋浴  热水浴
cold baths, ice baths, hot showers, hot baths
如果超出了人们所能接受的标准范围
that are beyond the kind of norm of what's comfortable,
那你要非常小心
you have to be extremely careful
并请教医生
and please consult a doctor.
可以这么说
I think it's fair to say
大多数人想要
that most people would like to have
白天有很多精力
a lot of energy during the day,
如果你白天工作
if you work during the day.
他们希望自己的精力在晚上逐渐减少
And they'd like their energy to taper off at night.
可以这么说
And I think it's fair to say
大多数人不喜欢生病
that most people don't enjoy being sick.
没有人想生病
Nobody wants to get sick.
换句话说  你想拥有能量
In other words, you want to have energy,
而你希望你的免疫系统运作良好
and you want your immune system to function well,
抵御各种感染
to ward off infections of various kinds,
细菌感染  病毒感染等
bacterial infections, viral infections, et cetera.
结果发现是这两种激素
And it turns out that the two hormones
在主导那些过程
that dominate those processes
拥有足够的能量并拥有健康的免疫系统
of having enough energy and having a healthy immune system
那就是皮质醇和肾上腺素
are cortisol and epinephrine.
Epinephrine和Adrenaline其实是一回事
Epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline.
在体内  我们倾向于将肾上腺素称为Adrenaline
In the body we tend to call adrenaline adrenaline,
在大脑中  我们倾向于将肾上腺素称为epinephrine
and in the brain we tend to call adrenaline epinephrine.
真是不好意思
And I'm sorry for that
我没有创建这个命名系统
I didn't create this naming system.
而且其背后的故事是无趣的
And the story behind it is uninteresting
而且不值得我们花费时间讲
and not worth our time.
我将使用两个名词
I will use the words adrenaline and epinephrine
但这两个名词在今天的播客重视可以互换的
interchangeably today.
皮质醇是皮质醇
Cortisol is cortisol.
我只想介绍一下
And I just want to cover a little bit about
什么是皮质醇和肾上腺素？
what cortisol and epinephrine are?
它们在身体和大脑中释放在哪里？
Where they are released in the body and brain?
因为如果你能理解
Because if you can understand that
你将更好地了解如何控制它们
you will understand better how to control them.
首先  皮质醇是类固醇激素
First of all, cortisol is a steroid hormone
很像雌激素和睾丸激素
much like estrogen and testosterone
因为它来自胆固醇
in that it is derived from cholesterol.
现在可能是你所食用的胆固醇
Now that could be cholesterol that you eat,
可能是肝脏产生的胆固醇
it could be cholesterol that's produced by the liver.
你们中许多人可能知道
As many of you probably know
饮食中胆固醇
the relationship between dietary cholesterol,
与你所吃的脂肪和血液中的胆固醇之间的关系
the fats that you eat and blood cholesterol,
是一个非常有争议的话题
and liver cholesterol is a very controversial one.
这是一个经久不衰的话题
It's a barbed wire topic.
有些人声称
There are people that claim
饮食中胆固醇的影响为零
that dietary cholesterol has zero impact
来自肝脏的循环胆固醇
on circulating cholesterol coming from the liver,
有些人认为完全相反
and there are people who argue the exact opposite,
我要说的是  两者都有良好的数据
both with good data in hand I would say.
这个想法有一些问题
There are some problems for the idea
你所有的胆固醇水平
that all your cholesterol levels
由饮食摄入量决定
are determined by dietary intake.
即那个厌食症
Namely, that anorexics
他们的肝脏经常产生有很高的胆固醇水平
often have very high levels of cholesterol that their liver produces,
即使他们吃得很少
even though they are eating very little
有时根本不吃饭
and sometimes not eating at all.
因此  请了解胆固醇是前体分子
So understand that cholesterol is a precursor molecule,
意思是它是很多东西的底物
meaning it's the substrate from which a lot of things
比如睾丸激素和雌激素
like testosterone and estrogen are made.
还请你了解胆固醇
Please also understand that cholesterol
可以制成雌激素  睾丸激素或皮质醇
can be made into estrogen, or testosterone, or cortisol.
那皮质醇是
And that cortisol is sort of the competitive partner
雌激素和睾丸激素的竞争合作伙伴
to estrogen and testosterone.
这是什么意思
What this means is,
不管你正在吃或产生多少胆固醇
no matter how much cholesterol you're eating or you produce,
无论是低还是高
whether or not it's low or it's high,
如果你承受更多的胆固醇
if you are stressed more of that cholesterol
将致力于制造皮质醇
is going to be devoted toward creating cortisol,
这确实是一种压力荷尔蒙
which is indeed a stress hormone.
但是  压力这个词不应该使你感到不适
However, the word stress shouldn't stress you out,
因为你需要皮质醇
because you need cortisol,
皮质醇至关重要
cortisol is vital.
你不希望皮质醇水平过低
You don't want your cortisol levels to be too low.
这对免疫系统功能非常重要
It's very important for immune system function,
为了记忆  不要沮丧
for memory, for not getting depressed.
你只是不希望皮质醇水平过高
You just don't want your cortisol levels to be too high
而你不希望他们被过分提高
and you don't want them to be elevated
甚至在一天中的错误时间达到正常水平
even to normal levels at the wrong time of day.
因此  我们将讨论如何控制
So we're going to talk how to control
皮质醇的时机和水平
the timing and level of your cortisol.
肾上腺素也被妖魔化了
Epinephrine or adrenaline has also been demonized a bit.
我们认为它是压力荷尔蒙
We think of it as the stress hormone,
这件事使我们感到焦虑  战斗或逃跑
this thing that makes us anxious, fight or flight.
你知道  我们曾经被狮子追赶
You know, we used to get chased by lions
和老虎  还有熊  现在我们没有被追赶了
and tigers, and bears, and now we don't.
这是古代遗传下来的 但是这是完全错误的
and it's this ancient hangover, that's all wrong.
事实是肾上腺素
The fact of the matter is the epinephrine
是你免疫力最好的朋友
is your best friend when it comes to your immunity,
在保护你免受感染方面
when it comes to protecting you from infection.
我们将讨论原因
And we're going to talk about why,
肾上腺素是你最好的朋友
and epinephrine adrenaline is your best friend
在记忆方面
when it comes to remembering things
学习和激活神经可塑性方面
and learning and activating neuroplasticity.
我们也将讨论这一点
We're going to talk about that as well.
再一次  这是一个多少和多长时间的问题
Once again, it's a question of how much and how long
以及释放的具体时间
and the specific timing of release
皮质醇和肾上腺素
of cortisol and epinephrine,
并不是说皮质醇和肾上腺素好 或者坏
as opposed to cortisol and adrenaline being good or bad.
当它们受到监管时  它们真是棒极了
They're terrific when they're regulated,
如果管制不当  它们会很糟糕
they are terrible when they're misregulated.
我们会为你提供许多工具来更好地对其进行监管
And we will give you lots of tools to regulate them better.
皮质醇生物学101  不到两分钟的简要讲解
Cortisol biology 101 in less than two minutes.
你的大脑产生 我们称之为"释放激素"的东西
Your brain makes what we call releasing hormones
在这种情况下  有促肾上腺皮质激素释放激素
and in this case, there's corticotropin releasing hormone.
CRH是由你大脑中的神经元产生的
CRH is made by neurons in your brain,
它导致垂体
it causes the pituitary,
这个腺体
this gland that sits about
在你的嘴顶前方一英寸
an inch in front of the roof of your mouth
和大脑的底部释放ACTH
and the base of your brain to release ACTH.
然后ACTH进入并导致你的肾上腺
ACTH then goes and causes your adrenals,
在腰部  位于肾脏上方
which sit above your kidneys in your lower back
释放皮质醇
to release cortisol.
所谓的压力荷尔蒙
A so-called stress hormone,
但我希望你想起皮质醇的时候
but I would like you to think about cortisol
不是把它想成压力荷尔蒙  而是作为能量荷尔蒙
not as a stress hormone but as a hormone of energy.
它会在大脑和身体中产生一种感受
It produces a situation in the brain and body
让你想要移动
whereby you want to move,
不想休息
and whereby you don't want to rest,
这样一来  你至少一开始就不想吃东西
and whereby you don't want to eat at least at first.
接下来 肾上腺素101  不到两分钟的时间
Epinephrine or adrenaline 101 in less than two minutes.
当你感觉到压力时
When you sense a stressor with your mind
或者你的身体感觉到压力时
or your body senses a stressor
从伤口或类似的东西
from a wound or something of that sort.
信号被发送到神经元
A signal is sent to neurons
在你的身体中间
that are in the middle of your body.
它们被称为同情链神经节
They are called the sympathetic chain ganglia.
名称不一定重要
The name doesn't necessarily matter.
他们很快释放去甲肾上腺素
They release Norepinephrine very quickly.
几乎就像是洒水系统
It's almost like a sprinkler system
只是用肾上腺素给你的身体打气
that just hoses your body with epinephrine.
那会增加心率
That will increase heart rate,
会增加呼吸频率
will increase breathing rate.
在某些情况下  它会收缩你的血管
In some cases it will constrict your blood vessels,
这也将增加血管和动脉的大小
it will also increase the size of vessels and arteries
使血液流向你的重要器官
that are giving blood flow to your vital organs.
这就是为什么在压力重重时  四肢会发冷的原因
This is why your extremities get cold when you're stressed
而且你的心脏跳动更快
and your heart is beating faster.
更多的精力投入到了你的核心
More of that energy is being devoted toward your core.
你还可以从肾上腺 释放肾上腺素
You also release adrenaline from your adrenals,
也就是在你的肾脏上方  再说一次
again riding on top of your kidneys.
那些是第二系统
Those are second system
从而使你的系统充满肾上腺素
whereby your system gets flooded with adrenaline in pulses.
因此  你可以得到一个脉冲  你可以得到10个脉冲
So you can get one pulse, you can get 10 pulses.
我们将讨论如何调节脉冲数
We'll talk about how to regulate the number of pulses
然后从大脑的某个区域释放它
and you release it from an area of your brain
叫做蓝斑
called locus coeruleus,
并在你的大脑中产生警觉
and that creates alertness in your brain.
如果你想了解更多有关压力反应的信息
If you want to learn more about the stress response
以及所有的细节
and all the details of that,
包括一些有关如何调节压力的协议
including some protocols of how to regulate stress
请参阅我们有关压力的一集
please see our episode about stress.
我在那儿讲了很多细节
I go into a lot of detail there.
我今天将讨论一些相同的主题
I will touch on some of the same themes today,
但我真的很想介绍能量和免疫系统
but I really want to cover energy and the immune system.
如果你非常感兴趣
And if you're very much interested
在压力和压力调节方面
in stress per say and stress regulation,
请参阅有关压力的播客
please see the episode on stress.
好的所以我们有皮质醇和肾上腺素
Okay. So we have cortisol and we have epinephrine,
它们的净效果是增加能量/精力
and their net effect is to increase energy.
首先  我想给你一个工具
So first of all, I want to give you a tool
这将帮助你调节皮质醇
that will help you regulate cortisol
还可以帮助避免
and can also help stave off
某些类型的精神疾病
certain patterns of mental illness.
那么  它当然不会自己治愈精神疾病
Now of course it's not going to cure mental illness on its own,
但它可以支持健康的心理状态
but it can support healthy state of mind,
并有助于减少不健康的心理状态
and can help reduce unhealthy states of mind,
包括抑郁症
including depression.
所以第一个工具是确保
So the first tool is to make sure
你早晨起床时 皮质醇是处于最高水平的
that your highest levels of cortisol are first thing in the morning when you wake up.
每24小时一种或另一种方式
One way or another every 24 hours
你的皮质醇会增加
you will get an increase in cortisol.
那是不可商议的  它被写入你的基因组中
That is non-negotiable that is written into your genome.
皮质醇的增加可以唤醒你
That increasing cortisol is there to wake you up
为了使你保持警觉
and to make you alert,
是为了从睡眠中刺激运动
it's to stimulate movement from being sleep,
大概是水平的
presumably horizontal,
起床并开始移动你的一天
to getting up and starting to move about your day.
我已经说过了  但我会再说一遍
And I've said it before, but I will say it again
刺激的最好方法
the best way to stimulate that
在适当的时间增加皮质醇
increase in cortisol at the appropriate time
醒来后不久
is that very soon after waking
醒来后30分钟左右
within 30 minutes or so after waking,
外面看些阳光
get outside view some sunlight,
即使是阴天
even if it's overcast,
外面看些阳光  没有墨镜
get outside view some sunlight, no sunglasses.
永远不要看任何特别明亮的光
Never look at any light so bright
可能会伤害你的眼睛
that it could damage your eyes,
但要花2到10分钟
but do that for two to 10 minutes.
如果很亮  两分钟
If it's very bright two minutes,
如果不是很亮10分钟
if it's not so bright 10 minutes.
这样做是因为在一天的早期
Do that, because in the early part of the day
你有机会定时释放皮质醇
you have the opportunity to time that cortisol release
在一天的早期
to the early part of the day,
将会改善
which will improve,
这已经得到同行评审研究的支持
this has been backed by peer reviewed studies,
它会改善你的注意力
it will improve your focus,
它将改善你的能量水平
it will improve your energy levels,
它将全天改善你的学习
and it will improve your learning throughout the day.
它还可以防止皮质醇增加的后移
It will also prevent a late shift in cortisol increase.
过一会儿皮质醇改变了
And late shifted cortisol,
表示皮质醇在8:00或9:00 PM左右增加
meaning cortisol that increases around 8:00 or 9:00 PM
是许多抑郁症的标志性特征
is a signature feature of many depressive disorders,
包括严重的抑郁症  焦虑症
including major depression, anxiety.
那当然是相关的
And that of course correlates
像失眠之类的事情
with things like insomnia, et cetera.
所以这是一个关键工具
So that's a key tool,
我不知道你们中有多少人会失眠
and I don't know how many of you are already doing that,
但是这是至关重要的
but it is vital to do.
现在我提到即使在阴天也有阳光
Now I mentioned sunlight even on cloudy days
这是有特定原因的
and there are specific reasons for that.
所以我只想简单介绍一下数据
So I want to just briefly cover the data
因为在讲睡眠的那期播客中
because in the episodes on sleep,
我谈到光的亮度
I talked about brightness of light
在调节皮质醇和睡眠中
in regulating cortisol and sleep.
我谈到了如何测量照度  亮度
And I talked about how to measure lux, brightness,
但我不够具体  我意识到
but I was not specific enough I realized
根据我收到的问题
based on the questions that I've received
从那一集开始
since that episode.
现在讲一下它的工作原理
So here's how it works,
到外面去晒太阳
going outside and getting some sunlight
要求我也告诉你多久
requires that I also tell you how long
在什么条件下
and under what conditions.
我说过透过窗户看不太好
I've said looking through a window is not as good,
需要50倍的时间
it takes 50 times longer
以获得尽可能多的光线  等等
to get as much light, et cetera, et cetera.
很多很多问题告诉我
Many, many questions have told me
我还不够具体
that I'm not being specific enough.
所以我要给你数据
So I'm going to give you the data
并从数据中你将了解
and from the data you will understand
确切地说  你每天需要执行多长时间
exactly how long you need to do this each day.
在晴天  所以是没有云遮盖
On a sunny day, so no cloud cover,
前提是太阳还没有到头顶
provided that the sun is not yet overhead.
在低空的地方
It's somewhere low in the sky
可能刚刚跨过地平线
could have just crossed the horizon,
或者如果你稍后再醒来
or if you wake up a little bit later
天空可能有些低
it could be somewhat low in the sky.
基本上是光的强度  亮度
Basically the intensity of light, the brightness,
大约是100,000勒克斯
is somewhere around 100,000 Lux.
照度只是亮度的度量
Lux is just a measurement of brightness.
如果你要下载光度计应用程序
If you want to download the app Light Meter,
那是一个免费的应用程序  它将使你能够做到这一点
that is a free app that will allow you to do that.
你可以将手指按住那里的小按钮
You can hold your finger down on the little button there
你可以四处移动
and you can move it around,
它将不断为你提供Lux读数
and it will continuously give you a Lux read out.
它不是完美的  不是精确的  但是已经非常好了
It's not perfect, it's not exact, but it's pretty good.
这是零成本
and it is zero cost.
我和这个公司没有关系
I have no relationship to Light Meter the company.
在阴天  大约是10,000勒克斯
On a cloudy day it's about 10,000 Lux.
好的因此减少了十倍
Okay. So tenfold reduction.
但是人造光
But bright artificial light,
非常明亮的人造光
very bright artificial light
在1000勒克斯左右
is somewhere around 1000 lux.
普通房间的光线约为100-200 lux
And ordinary room light is somewhere around 100-200 lux.
这与存在多少光散射有关
And it has to do with how much light scatter there is.
因此  即使你的灯泡非常明亮
So even if you have a very bright bulb
就在你旁边
sitting right next to you,
那是行不通的
that's not going to do the job.
在一天中的早些时候  光看你的手机 是不行的
Your phone will not do the job not early in the day
不能让你在适当的时间释放皮质醇
to get the cortisol released at the appropriate time
你需要出去
you need to get outside.
因此  让我们只设置几个常规参数
So let's just set a couple general parameters.
如果外面很亮而且没有云层
If it's bright outside and no cloud cover
光线可以是间接的
that light can be indirect.
你不必盯着太阳
You don't have to be staring into the sun,
请不要伤害你的眼睛
please don't damage your eyes.
我们还不能再生这些神经元
We can't regenerate those neurons yet
不能恢复丢失的视力
and restore vision that's lost,
但是如果你必须眨眼  那就意味着它太亮了
but if you have to blink, that means it's too bright.
当然可以眨眼  如果需要的话  请这样做
It's fine to blink of course, please do if you need to.
出门呆十分钟
Get outside for 10 minutes,
五分钟就足够了
or five minutes should suffice,
但是十分钟就足够了
but 10 minutes is sure to suffice.
如果是阴天  密云
If it's a cloudy day, dense overcast,
你可能需要大约30分钟
you're probably going to need about 30 minutes.
如果是轻云碎云盖
If it's light cloud broken cloud cover
它可能会在10到20分钟之间
it's probably going to be somewhere between 10 and 20 minutes.
如果你不能出去
And if you can't get outside
或者你在飞机上  头顶上光亮
or you're on an airplane and it's bright overhead,
人造灯或普通房间灯
artificial lights or ordinary room lights
这将花费你大约六个小时的时间
it's going to take you about six hours of light.
随着时间的流逝  你到达一天之中
And by time you reach the middle of your
有点清醒的时期  为时已晚
sort of wakeful period, it's too late.
你将无法改变时钟
You won't be able to shift your clock
然后你的皮质醇将逐渐开始漂移
and your cortisol will start drifting later and later.
这就是为什么定期亮起这一点至关重要的原因
This is why it's vital to get this light on a regular basis,
以便在当天早些时候释放皮质醇
to get that cortisol released early in the day.
这可以使你获得最佳的能量水平
That sets you up for optimal levels of energy,
它使你有充足的睡眠
it sets you up for great sleep.
但是今天不是真的讲睡眠
But today's not really about sleep
更多的是讲皮质醇脉冲  能量
it's more about energy that cortisol pulse
以及你在一天中可能会感到的压力
and the stress that you might feel early in the day
拥有一点额外的能量
from having a little bit extra energy.
那就是你想要的能量
That is the energy that you want
为了运动和学习  并做各种各样的事情
in order to move about and learn, and do various things.
那是健康的能量水平
That is a healthy level of energy.
因此  请尝试获得阳光
So please try and get that sunlight.
如果这样做符合你的协议
If it's within your protocols to do that,
并尝试获得足够的阳光
and try and get sufficient sunlight
早上的第一件事
first thing in the morning,
在第一个小时内再次出现
again within the first hour.
那是确保
That's the best way to make sure
你适当地选择皮质醇的时间
that you time your cortisol appropriately.
现在全天
Now throughout the day
你将经历不同的事情
you're going to experience different things.
你们中的大多数人并没有整日度过
Most of you are not spending your entire day
试图优化你的健康
trying to optimize your health.
你们当中有些人可能是
Some of you might be,
但是你们大多数人都有工作  有家庭
but most of you have jobs and you have families,
并且你有各种责任
and you have commitments.
生活是重心  给你提供压力
Life enters the picture and provides you stressors,
这些压力源  无论它们可能是什么
and those stressors, whatever they may happen to be,
一个难搞的同事
a difficult coworker,
对某事有些失望
some disappointment about something,
你没有得到你期望的加薪
you didn't get the raise you expected,
或者你没有得到你期望的假期
or you didn't get the vacation that you expected.
这些将导致皮质醇和肾上腺素的增加
Those will cause increases in cortisol and epinephrine.
了解这一点很重要
This is important to understand,
你没有今天早上
you don't have the luxury
没有得到皮质醇脉冲
of just having this morning cortisol
然后逐渐减小
and then having a taper off.
你要在一天中的主要皮质醇
You want that major cortisol early in the day
但是你可以期待
but then you can expect,
你应该预期整天内 皮质醇和肾上腺素会增加
you should expect increases in cortisol and adrenaline throughout the day
基于你不愉快的事件
based on events that are unpleasant to you.
所以对我来说  最让我不愉快的事件
So for me, the events that are most unpleasant to me
是交通堵塞之类的东西
are things like traffic,
要求我填写表格的电子邮件
emails that ask me to fill out a form
结果找不到链接
for which I can't find the link.
这些事情使我感到压力
These kinds of things stress me out,
我是人
I'm a human being.
我不会因为这些事情失去冷静
I don't lose my cool over them
但我能感觉到我的警惕程度提高
but I can feel my level of alertness
并增加了挫败感
and kind of frustration increased.
压力常有的事情
The normal kind of things that go with stress
有点紧张
tense up a little bit.
关键是皮质醇和肾上腺素的这些脉冲 峰值
The key is these blips in cortisol and epinephrine
需要缩短 很短
need to be brief.
你不能让他们这么频繁或持续这么长时间
You can't have them so often or lasting so long
你处于慢性皮质醇升高状态
that you are in a state of chronic cortisol elevation
或慢性肾上腺素升高
or chronic epinephrine elevation.
设计这种压力系统
This system of stress was designed
增强警觉性 并贯彻你的生活
to increase your alertness and mobilize you towards things,
那让你沮丧
get you frustrated,
并提供改变行为的机会
and provide the opportunity to change behavior.
那就是他们被设计要做的
That's what they were designed to do.
因此  如果你发现自己感到压力重重
So if you find yourself getting stressed
一直处于压力状态
and staying stressed,
在压力那集中  我们提供了很多出色的工具
there are great tools that we provide in the stress episode
与两次吸气呼气有关
that relate to things like the double inhale exhale,
所谓生理上的叹息
the so-called physiological sigh.
你可以合并NSDR
You can incorporate NSDR,
在非睡眠深度休息  等等
in non sleep deep rest protocol, et cetera.
但要了解能量
But understand that the energy
你在压力中经历过的
that you experienced during stress,
警觉性和注意力突然增加
that sudden increase in alertness and attention
那是因为看到困难
that comes from seeing something difficult.
那是一个健康的荷尔蒙系统
That is a healthy hormonal system
和有效的神经系统
and neural system that's working.
它起作用的原因是皮质醇
And the reason it works is that cortisol
当它释放到血液中时
when it's released into the bloodstream
它实际上可以与大脑中的受体结合
it actually can bind to receptors in the brain.
它可以结合杏仁核中的受体
It can bind receptors in the amygdala,
恐惧中心和威胁检测中心
fear centers and threat detection centers,
还有涉及到的大脑区域
but also areas of the brain that are involved
在学习  记忆和神经可塑性方面
in learning, and memory, and neuroplasticity.
这就是为什么我说神经可塑性
And this is why I say that neuroplasticity,
大脑通过经验
the brain's ability to change itself
来改变自己的能力
in response to experience
首先受到关注和专注的刺激
is first stimulated by attention and focus
经常伴随着低水平的激动状态
and often a low-level state of agitation.
所以要明白
So understand that,
而且你不会因此而烦恼
and you won't be quite so troubled about
轻微的压力增加
the little stress increases
一整天都在发生
that you experience throughout the day.
那么  有种方法可以利用压力
Now, there are ways to leverage stress,
肾上腺素和皮质醇以为你服务的方式
epinephrine and cortisol in ways that serve you
并以故意的方式做到这一点
and to do it in a deliberate way.
还有一些方法可以做到这一点
There are also ways to do that
但会增加你的压力阈值水平
that increase your level of stress threshold,
表示他们降低了
meaning they make it less likely
肾上腺素和皮质醇将被释放的可能性
that epinephrine and cortisol will be released.
所以我想谈谈这些实践的科学
So I want to talk about the science of those practices,
因为我经常被问及这些做法
'cause I get asked about these practices a lot.
Wim Hof呼吸之类的东西
Things like Wim Hof breathing
这也称为“ tummo呼吸”
which is also called tummo breathing.
像冰浴之类的东西
Things like ice baths.
诸如高强度间歇训练HIIT之类的事情
Things like high intensity interval training.
所有这些东西都有实用性
All of those things have utility.
问题是你如何使用它们
The question is how you use them
以及你使用它们的频率
and how often you use them.
这些工具就像生活中的压力一样
Those tools just like stress from a life event
可以增强免疫力或耗尽免疫力
can either enhance your immunity or deplete it.
没错  明明是同样做
That's right those same practices
冰浴  tummo呼吸
of ice baths, tummo breathing,
高强度间歇训练或任何形式的训练
high intensity interval training, or training of any kind
可能耗尽你的免疫系统  也可能改善免疫系统
can deplete your immune system or it can improve them.
可以改善它
Excuse me, they can improve it,
表示它们可以改善你的免疫系统
meaning they can improve your immune system.
关键是你使用它们的频率以及何时使用
The key is how often you use them and when,
所以我现在想回顾一下
and so I want to review that now
根据科学文献
in light of the scientific literature,
因为这样做可以建立起如何实践
because in doing that you can build practices
加入你的日常或隔日日常
into your daily or maybe every other day routine
确实可以帮助你缓冲
that can really help buffer you
对抗不健康水平的皮质醇和肾上腺素
against unhealthy levels of cortisol and epinephrine.
意思是如果皮质醇的增加太多了
Meaning cortisol increases that are much too great,
或持续太久
or that lasts much too long.
肾上腺素的增加太多了
Epinephrine increases that are much too great,
或持续太久
or that last much too long.
当然  我们将讨论所有因为过多的皮质醇
And of course we'll talk about all the negatives
肾上腺素过多会持续太长时间
that go along with having too much cortisol,
而产生的负面影响
too much epinephrine for too long.
但是你听到的很多
But you hear about those a lot.
你可能听说过库欣综合症
You hear about Cushing syndrome,
腹部脂肪堆积
you hear about abdominal fat accumulation.
睡眠障碍
You hear about sleep disturbances.
我想先说一些工具方法  你该怎么做
I want to arm you with the tools first
然后我们可以谈谈阴暗的一面
and then we can talk about the dark side,
以及所有
and all the things that hopefully
希望你将能够完全避免的坏事情
you'll be able to avoid entirely,
或者一旦掌握了工具
or that you can get yourself out of
你可以让自己摆脱困境
once you have the tools in hand.
假设有人告诉你一些令人不安的事情
Let's say somebody tells you something very troubling,
或你看手机时看到一条短信
or you look at your phone and you see a text message
这真的让你很沮丧
that's really upsetting to you.
这将立即导致
That will cause an immediate increase in
大脑和身体中的肾上腺素的增加  升高
epinephrine adrenaline in your brain and body.
而且基本上
And chances are it's going to increase
你的皮质醇水平也会增加
your levels of cortisol as well.
假设你进入冰浴或冷水淋浴
Let's say you get into an ice bath or a cold shower,
即使你喜欢寒冷
even if you love the cold,
或者  如果你讨厌寒冷
or if you hate the cold,
这将导致同等
that will cause an equivalent increase
在肾上腺素和皮质醇的增长
in epinephrine and cortisol.
我们不知道确切的水平
We don't know the exact levels
但这大概是一样的
but it's probably about the same.
假设你出门参加高强度间歇训练
Let's say you go out for high intensity interval training,
你决定要进行一些冲刺
you decide you're going to run some sprints,
你做一组重复的动作
you do some repeats,
或者你要去健身房举重
or you're going to do some weightlifting in the gym
而且你喜欢在健身房举重
and you love lifting weights in the gym.
也许你喜欢举重之类的
Maybe you like the power lifting thing,
或者你决定要做一些热瑜伽
or you decide that you want to do some hot yoga,
或你真正喜欢或讨厌的东西
or some thing that you really enjoy, or you hate,
这都会增加你的
you're going to increase your
肾上腺素和皮质醇水平
epinephrine and cortisol levels.
这你没办法控制
There's simply no way around this.
假设你决定坐下
Let's say you decide to sit down
然后你将进行深呼吸
and you're going to do some deep breathing.
我们都听说过深呼吸的好处
We all hear about the benefits of deep breathing.
吸气  呼气  吸气  呼气
So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.
你将获得
You're going to get big increases
肾上腺素和皮质醇的大幅增长
in epinephrine and cortisol.
来自多项研究的数据支持了这一点
The data from multiple studies support this.
所有这些都是“压力源”
All of those are stressors in air quotes.
现在有一种方法  你可以在认知上重新构架
Now there is a way that you can cognitively reframe
那些是什么
what those are.
你可以告诉自己我爱高强度
You can tell yourself I love high intensity
间歇训练  或者我喜欢减肥训练
interval training, or I love weight training.
我个人喜欢运动
I personally love exercise.
我不是特别喜欢寒冷
I'm not crazy about the cold,
虽然我不时地做一些冷暴露的东西
I do some cold exposure stuff now and again,
我们将在下一集中谈论很多有关如何做到这一点的内容
and we're going to talk a lot about how to do that
以最佳方式做到
in the optimal way in an upcoming episode.
但是  对我来说  受凉对我来说并不好
But you know, getting into the cold doesn't feel good to me.
我告诉自己对我有好处
I tell myself it's good for me
我在某个时候喜欢它
and I enjoy it at some point
通常在我出去的时候我还挺喜欢的
usually when I'm getting out.
所有这些都会增加肾上腺素  然后
All of those increase epinephrine and guess what,
它们会增加你的精力和警觉水平
they increase your levels of energy and alertness.
所以如果你是一个在精力
So if you're somebody who struggles
和机敏性方面有困难的人  那可能是有益的
with energy and alertness it can be beneficial,
只要你得到医生的许可
provided you get clearance from your doctor
在你的一天中做一些事情
to have some sort of protocol built into your day
故意地来增加肾上腺素的水平
where you deliberately increase your levels of epinephrine
和你的皮质醇水平
and your levels of cortisol.
我想特别强调这一点
And I want to put the emphasis on deliberately.
那你该怎么做呢？
So how would you do that?
好吧  让淋浴变冷很容易
Well, it's quite easy to turn the shower cold
你只要站进去
and get into that,
那会唤醒你的
that will wake you up.
真的就是唤醒你
And it literally wakes you up
因为肾上腺素增加
because of increases in epinephrine.
你可以做那种深呼吸
You can do deep breathing of the sort
你反复吸气和呼气25或30次
where you inhale and exhale repeatedly 25 or 30 times,
也许屏住呼吸几秒钟
maybe hold your breath for a few seconds
呼气  然后重复
on an exhale and then repeat,
所谓的Wim Hoff或tummo型呼吸
so-called Wim Hoff, or tummo type breathing.
许多肾上腺素释放到你的系统中
Lots of adrenaline is released into your system
当你这样做的时候
when you do that.
之后你将拥有更多能量/精力
You will have more energy afterwards.
因此  了解这一点非常重要
So it's really important to understand
身体无法区分
that the body doesn't distinguish
在令人不安的短信  冰块  tummo呼吸
between a troubling text message, ice, tummo breathing,
或高强度间歇训练
or high intensity interval training,
或其他任何形式的锻炼  都是压力
or any other kind of exercise, it's all stress.
认知地重新定义并告诉自己
Cognitively reframing that and telling yourself
我喜欢这个  我喜欢它
I like this, I enjoy it.
不会改变那个分子的方式
Is not going to change the way that that molecule
影响你的身体和大脑
impacts your body and brain.
我有点笑  因为很多人经常会说
I sort of chuckle because people would love to tell you
你要做的就是暗示自己
that all you have to do is say,
“哦  这对我有好处”  不是的
"Oh, this is good for me." No.
告诉自己  对自己有好处
What it does to tell yourself that it's good for you
或你喜欢它
or that you enjoy it.
这种方法实际上发生的是  它释放了其他分子
Is that it liberates other molecules
比如说多巴胺和5-羟色胺
like dopamine and serotonin
帮助缓冲了肾上腺素的反应
that help buffer the epinephrine response.
那么  其中的原理是什么
Now, the way that it does that,
我在上一集中谈到过
I've talked about in previous episode,
但我只想提一下
but I'll just mention
多巴胺是肾上腺素的前体
that dopamine is the precursor to epinephrine.
肾上腺素是由多巴胺制成的  好吗？
Epinephrine, adrenaline is made from dopamine, okay?
皮质醇是由胆固醇制成的
Cortisol is made from cholesterol.
肾上腺素由多巴胺制成
Epinephrine is made from dopamine.
这就是为什么如果你告诉自己
And that's why if you tell yourself
你正在享受一些东西
you're enjoying something,
因为多巴胺太主观了
and because dopamine is so subjective
你可以通过某些方式
that you can in some ways,
只要你不完全对自己撒谎
as long as you're not completely lying to yourself,
你可以得到更多的肾上腺素
you can get more epinephrine,
你获得更多里程或更多能力
you get more mileage or more ability
推动某些事情
to push through something.
你可以对其进行重新构架
And you can sort of reframe it,
但这并不是真正的认知重塑
but it's not really cognitive reframing.
认知部分是触发因素
The cognitive part is the trigger,
但这是化学物质
but it's a chemical substance
那实际上是在那里发生的
that's actually occurring there.
多巴胺能给你更多肾上腺素
It's dopamine giving you more epinephrine,
肾上腺素释放幅度更大
A bigger amplitude epinephrine release,
它给了你一些控制感
and it gives you some sense of control.
所以这是任何人都可以使用的方法
So here's a protocol that anyone can use.
如果你想提高能量水平
If you want to increase levels of energy,
如果你白天白天精力不足
if you suffer from low energy during the daytime,
或只要你想保持警惕
or whenever it is that you'd like to be alert.
选择一种可以相当一致地进行的练习
Pick a practice that you can do fairly consistently,
也许每天
maybe every day,
但也许每三天或每四天
but maybe every third day or every fourth day,
也许是冰浴或冷浴
maybe it's an ice bath or a cold bath.
也许是冷水淋浴
Maybe it's a cold shower.
也许是循环呼气法
Maybe it's the cyclic inhale exhale,
我描述的呼吸方案
breathing protocol I described,
如果不清楚  人们总是要求演示
if that wasn't clear and people always ask for a demo,
我现在不会做整一套
I'm not going to do the whole thing right now,
但我愿意演示一下
but I'm willing to do a few rounds of this,
我应该说是几个周期
or a few cycles I should say.
所以就是 吸气
So it's inhale.
我会做得更深入  像这样
I would do that more deeply, more like.
你重复执行25次  30次
You do that 25, 30 times repeatedly
你将开始感到温暖
you will start to feel warm.
瑜伽界的人们
People in the yoga community,
他们会说你在生热
they say you're generating heat.
你不会产生热量  不会释放肾上腺素
You're not generating heat, releasing adrenaline.
吸气和呼气  吸气呼气25或30次
Inhale and exhale, inhale exhale 25 or 30 times,
你会感到一点烦躁和压力
you will feel agitated and stressed.
那是因为你在体内释放肾上腺素
That's because you're releasing adrenaline in your body
那是因为你要释放
and that's because you're releasing
大脑中的去甲肾上腺素
norepinephrine in your brain,
这样你会更加警觉
and you'll be more alert.
然后  你可以遵循25或30个呼吸周期
Then you can follow that 25 or 30 breath cycles
呼气的时候
with an exhale hold,
屏住呼吸15到30秒
and hold your breath for 15 to 30 seconds.
请大家  要在干燥的陆地上这样做
Always, always, always do this on dry land.
切勿在驾驶  操作重型机械时做
Never while driving, operating heavy machinery,
遵守所有标准安全协议
all the standard safety protocols.
请永远不要靠近水
Never near water please,
已经有人在水里这么做
people have passed out and died doing this
昏倒了  死了
with breath holds in water.
已经出现了一些与之相关的死亡案例
There are several deaths associated with it,
在陆地上  与你的医生确认可能更安全
on land it's probably safer, clear with your doctor,
但是25到30屏气呼气
but 25, 30 breaths exhale hold,
25、30个呼吸再次呼气
25, 30 breasts again exhale hold,
25 30个呼吸再次呼气
25 30 breasts again exhale hold.
然后  如果你愿意  可以吸气并保持
And then if you like you can do an inhale and hold
如果在你的安全范围内
if that's within your margins of safety.
因此  如果所有这些协议
So if all these protocols,
所有这些活动都是等同的
all these activities are just equivalent,
他们只是压力
they're just stress.
那我们如何使它们对我们有益呢？
Then how do we make them good for us?
我们实际上如何从中受益？
How do we actually benefit from them?
那么  当然寒冷本身
Now, of course the cold itself
可以起到一些促进健康的作用
can have some health promoting effects.
它可以增加棕色脂肪的生热和新陈代谢
It can increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism,
高强度间歇训练
high intensity interval training,
或其他形式的锻炼
or other forms of exercise
当然有心血管作用
of course has cardiovascular effects
对我们有好处
that can be good for us
重量训练等
as does weight training, et cetera.
但是我们在这里谈论的是
But what we're talking about here
是增加能量并教我们的大脑和身体的方法
are ways to increase energy and to teach our brain and body
教自己如何调节压力反应
to teach ourselves how to regulate the stress response.
所以除了实际做法的好处
So in addition to the benefits of the actual practices
我们正在谈论的是建立一个系统
what we're talking about is building a system
这样当你体验
so that when you experience
生活事件中肾上腺素和皮质醇的增加
increases in epinephrine and cortisol from life events
你可以更好地缓冲这些
you're able to better buffer those.
而且我们也在谈论
And we are also talking about
总体上可以增加能量/精力的方法
ways that you can increase energy overall.
因为这就是今天的播客要讲的内容
'Cause that's what today's episode is all about,
能量和免疫系统
energy and the immune system.
的确  我们将谈论
And indeed, we will talk about
如何实际利用特定方法
how you can actually leverage specific protocols
增强你的免疫系统需求
to increase your immune system on demand.
有大量的科学数据
There's great scientific data
支持人可以做到这一点
to support that one can do that.
所以有一个非常重要的生物学机制
So there's a biological mechanism that's very important
如果你想做那些事
if you want to do those things,
按需增加能量和免疫系统
increase energy and your immune system on demand.
学会实时缓解需求压力
Learn to buffer stress on demand in real time.
这意味着采用这些方法
And it means taking these protocols,
不管是冷水还是这些做法
these practices whether or not it's cold water,
或冰浴或运动  或其中任何一项
or ice bath, or exercise, or any of those
进行一次很小但非常有力的调整
and making one small but very powerful adjustment
通过你做的方式
in how you perform them.
但是为了进行调整
But in order to make that adjustment,
我不能只告诉你调整
I can't just tell you the adjustment.
我要告诉你机制
I have to tell you the mechanism
这样你就可以知道自己是否正确执行了操作
so that you know if you're doing it correctly or not.
事实就是这样
This is really a case where
如果你能了解一些机制
if you can understand a little bit of mechanism,
你将比仅仅采用方法要好得多
you will be far better off than just adopting protocols.
因此  如果你从本集中别无其他选择
So if you take away nothing else from this episode
除了我要告诉你的
except what I'm about to tell you
请带走我要讲的这些信息
please take away the information I'm about to tell
我提到的皮质醇是从肾上腺释放的
Cortisol as I mentioned is released from the adrenals
它可以与受体结合
and it can bind to receptors.
它可以在身体和大脑中起作用
It can have action, both in the body and in the brain.
实际上  它可以绑定到所谓的
In fact, it can bind to the so-called
大脑中的威胁检测中心
threat detection center in the brain,
或其中之一是杏仁核
or one of them which is the amygdala,
也称为恐惧中心
also called the fear center.
可以这样做是因为皮质醇
It can do that because cortisol
可以穿越血脑屏障
can cross the blood brain barrier.
它可以在体内释放并交叉
It can be released in the body and cross
这种生物屏障
this biological barrier.
就像栅栏一样  使大脑无法进入其他物质
It's like a fence that keeps things out of the brain
但皮质醇拥有通过的权利  它可以通过
but cortisol has passing rights, it can go through.
肾上腺素不能
Epinephrine cannot,
肾上腺素是极化的
epinephrine is polarized,
它的形状是这样的
the shape of it is such that
它不能通过血脑屏障
it can't make it through the blood brain barrier.
这就是为什么你肾上腺和大脑上
That's one of the reasons why it's released both
都会释放肾上激素的原因之一
from the adrenals in your body
或者从这个脑干区域释放出来
and released from this brainstem area,
大脑中的蓝斑
the locus coeruleus in your brain.
那是很强大的事情  因为这意味着
That's a powerful thing, because what it means is that
身体可以进入准备状态和警觉状态
the body can enter states of readiness and alertness
而头脑保持平静
while the mind remains calm.
从生物学上讲是可能的
That is biologically possible,
这不仅仅是心理上的把戏
it's not just a psychological trick.
并且有一些方法可以做到这一点
And there are ways that one can do that.
所以我想在这一点上
So I'm presuming at this point
你得到晨光
that you're getting your morning light
到你的皮质醇增加的时候
to time your cortisol increase.
我想你想要更多的能量/精力
I'm presuming that you want more energy
或者你想增强免疫力
or that you want to increase your immune system,
它对抗各种感染
its function and its ability
的功能和能力
to combat infections of various kinds.
我的建议是
And what I'm suggesting is that
你从之前讲过的方法中挑选
you pick from the pallet of exercises that are out there,
或增加肾上腺素的工具
or tools that are out there to increase epinephrine.
有很多方法可以做到这一点
There are a lot of ways to do that.
你可以像我提到的那样通过冷水来做到这一点
You can do that as I mentioned through cold water,
通过运动
through exercise.
你甚至可以做到
You can even do that
通过与其他人对抗
by having confrontations with other people.
从生物学的角度来看  原理是相同的
At a biological level, it is identical.
所以如果你想上网
So if you like to go online
并发表那种评论
and place the kind of comments
或阅读各种不顺眼东西
or read the kinds of things,
或看看引起你愤怒的事物
or look at the kinds of things that agitate you,
如果你愿意  可以将其视为机会
you can if you like look at that as an opportunity,
我不建议你那样做
I'm not suggesting you do that,
我想看到人们照顾自己
I'd like to see people taking care of themselves
坦率地说  彼此之间的破坏力要小得多
and each other in much less destructive ways frankly.
但前提是要增加
But the prerequisite here is getting an increase
从体内释放出的肾上腺素
in adrenaline released from the body.
那么  最简单的方法来描述如何做到这一点
Now the simplest way to describe how to do that
将在冷水浴
would be in the context of cold water
或呼吸方法
or a breathing protocol,
因为那样我就不必处理
because then I don't have to deal with the
未知的生活环境 刺激你
unknown life circumstances that get you triggered,
或者我可以说是什么让我被刺激
or I could say what gets me triggered
阻止这种情况
but I'm not going to.
因此  让我们假设冷水
So let's presume cold water.
假设你决定要洗个冷水澡
So let's say you decide you're going to take a cold shower.
你进入冷水淋浴  如果天气足够冷
You get into the cold shower and if it's cold enough,
那会很压力
that will be stressful,
你的肾上腺素会增加
you will experience an increase in epinephrine,
它将提高你的警觉性
it will increase your alertness.
现在你将其用作练习
Now you're using this as a practice,
作为一种构建工具  你可以将其称为弹性工具
as a tool to build you could call it resilience,
但是保持头脑冷静的能力
but the ability to stay calm in the mind
在身体受到压力的同时
while being stressed in the body,
肾上腺素在体内
epinephrine is in the body.
你可以通过主观地尝试使自己平静下来来做到这一点
And you do that by subjectively trying to calm yourself.
那么  你可以通过告诉自己对自己有好处来做到这一点
Now you can do that by telling yourself it's good for you
通过强调你的呼气
by emphasizing your exhales.
你可以采取任何措施尝试保持冷静
Anything that you can do to try and stay calm
尽管你处在一个
despite the fact that you are in a heightened
高度警觉的状态
state of alertness.
你通过运动做到这一点
You do this with exercise,
你可以通过音乐来做到这一点
you can do this with music.
几乎所有可以给你的东西
Pretty much anything that will give you
真正提高警觉的状态
a really heightened state of alertness
为你提供尝试在大脑部位保持冷静的机会
offers you the opportunity to try and stay calm in the mind.
你正在尝试在机制层面上做的事情
What you're trying to do at a mechanistic level
是要从肾上腺  释放肾上腺素
is to have adrenaline released from the adrenals,
但没有达到脑干中肾上腺素释放
but not have adrenaline, epinephrine released
的那种程度
from the brain stem to the same degree.
所以你不只是试图缓冲它
So you're not just trying to buffer this,
你并不是要说：“哦  这对我有好处
you're not trying to say, "Oh, this is good for me,
这对我有好处  多生产”
this is good for me, I'm going to grind this out."
不是越多越好
You're not trying to grind it out,
而是要从容应对
you're trying to move through this calmly
同时保持警觉性
while maintaining alertness.
你并不一定要进行区域划分
You're not trying to zone out necessarily,
尽管也许有帮助
although maybe that helps.
你不是想分散自己的注意力
You're not trying to distract yourself,
你想做的是
what you're trying to do is
从认知上将你的关系转变为躯体关系
shift cognitively your relationship to the somatic,
对身体的压力反应
to the body stress response.
现在我敢肯定你们当中有些人在说
Now I'm sure some of you out there are shouting,
“是的  那就像是什么  什么什么其他东西”
"Yeah, that's exactly like whatever, whatever, whatever."
我同意
I agree.
在许多方面  这是自我指导的
This is in many ways a self-directed
一种压力接种
kind of stress inoculation,
但是我们并不是说这是压力接种
but we're not talking about this as stress inoculation.
我们正在谈论这种方式
We're talking about this as a way
是为了增加精力和注意力
to increase energy and focus.
原因是肾上腺素
And the reason is that epinephrine
在体内释放时
when released in the body
对免疫系统有深远的影响
has a profound effect on the immune system.
而当在大脑中释放时
And when released in the brain has a profound effect
会对学习和记忆信息的能力   并保持警惕
on the ability to learn and remember information
产生深远的影响
and to be alert.
因此  我们正在谈论拆分位置
And so we're talking about splitting the location,
分开的位置
separating the location from which
你有肾上腺素释放
you have epinephrine, adrenaline released.
好的因此  假设你正在执行此练习
Okay. So let's say you are doing this practice
只是为了清醒
simply to wake up,
好吧  冷水洗澡就可以了
okay, cold shower will do that,
运动也能够做到这一点
exercise will do that.
保持冷静的能力
The ability to stay calm in mind
同时增加肾上腺素水平
while having heightened levels of adrenaline
以及体内的皮质醇
and presumably cortisol as well in the body.
但是皮质醇将在各处传播
But the cortisol is going to circulate everywhere.
稍后我们将进一步讨论皮质醇
We'll talk a little bit about cortisol more in a moment.
你可以通过某种自我舒缓的镇定方式来做到这一点
You could do that through some self soothing calming way,
这将是高度个性化的
that's going to be highly individual.
你可以通过告诉自己喜欢它来做到这一点  等等
You can do it by telling yourself you enjoy it, et cetera.
但是你需要了解的是
But what you need to understand
是在这种做法之后的近期内
is that in the immediate period following that practice
你的系统  整个大脑和身体都不同
your system, your entire brain and body are different.
实际上  你的身体已准备好抵抗感染
Your body is actually primed to resist infection,
当你的肾上腺素含量高时
when you have high levels of epinephrine in it
在短时间内
for short periods of time.
因此  科学研究探索了如何
So the scientific study that explored how
体内肾上腺素增加
increasing adrenaline in the body
可以提高免疫抵抗力
can improve immune resistance is grounded
在一个众所周知的现象中
in a well-known phenomenon
压力增加
that increases in stress
真正保护你免受感染
actually protect you against infection
在短期内
in the short term.
所以我想先看一下经典数据
So I want to look at the classic data first,
描述所做的事情
describe what was done.
然后我想谈谈最近的研究
And then I want to talk about the more recent study
立即采取行动
which is immediately actionable.
确实有一些经典的研究基础
There are classic set of studies that are really based
主要是关于布鲁斯·麦克尤恩（Bruce McEwen）的工作
mainly on the work of somebody named Bruce McEwen,
他曾在纽约洛克菲勒大学任教
who was at the Rockefeller University in New York.
布鲁斯几年前去世
Bruce passed away a few years ago,
但他有数十年难以置信的影响力
but he had many decades of incredibly impactful
他这样做的时候就在他的皮带下工作
work under his belt when he did.
接下来我要谈论的工作
The work that I'm going to talk about next
已经在人类身上完成了
has been done in humans
并已在动物身上完成
and has been done in animals,
并真正探讨了如何诱发压力
and has really explored how inducing stress
可以增强免疫系统的功能
can enhance the function of the immune system
在短期内
in the short term.
当我的意思是短期的时候
And when, I mean short term,
我的意思是大约一到四天
I mean about one to four days.
我不会仔细研究这项研究的所有细节
I'm not going to go through all the details of the study,
但本质上他们在做什么是在暴露主体
but essentially what they were doing was exposing subjects
某种感染
to some sort of infection,
细菌或病毒感染
either bacterial or viral infection,
并引起压力
and inducing stress.
听起来像是双重打击  对吧？
It sounds like a double whammy, right?
你可能以为可能会受到一些电击
You'd think that maybe getting a little electric foot shock,
或冷水暴露
or cold water exposure,
或增加压力的东西
or something to increase your levels of stress
和肾上腺素会
and adrenaline would just make
感染的后果更糟
the effects of the infection worse,
但不  恰恰相反
but no, quite the opposite.
短暂的压力回弹
Brief bouts of stress,
现在你应该在考虑什么
which now you should be thinking about
在皮质醇和肾上腺素释放方面
in terms of cortisol and epinephrine release
我们实际上能够增强免疫系统的功能
we're actually able to increase immune system function.
现在那不应该让你感到惊讶
Now that shouldn't surprise you
如果你懂一点
if you understand a little bit
关于肾上腺素如何在人体和大脑中起作用
about how epinephrine works in the body and in the brain.
本质上是信号
It essentially is the signal
通过它神经系统可以通知免疫器官
by which the nervous system can inform immune organs,
脾脏和其他器官之类的东西
things like the spleen and other organs
可以制造各种杀伤细胞
that make killer cells of various kinds,
B细胞和T细胞 B cells and T cells,
去抵抗感染
to go in combat infections,
细菌和病毒
bacteria, and viruses.
你的免疫系统还怎么知道
How else would your immune system know
有感染吗？
that there was an infection?
你的免疫系统可以识别外来入侵者
Your immune system can recognize foreign invaders
但是神经系统提供了信号
but the nervous system provides the signal,
释放杀手细胞的警报信号
the sort of alarm signal that liberates the killer cells,
告诉他们有问题
that tells them there's a problem
可以这么说去解决问题
and to go seek out the problem so to speak.
所以这里的持续时间真的很重要
So the duration here is really important
因为如果压力持续太久太久
because if stress stayed too high for too long,
那是的  确实压力会阻碍免疫反应
then yes indeed stress can hinder the immune response.
但是大约一到四天的时间
But for a period of about one to four days,
它实际上可以保护你
it actually can protect you
通过增加免疫反应
by way of increasing the immune response.
那么  我可以肯定地说
Now, I can say with certainty
这种作用是由肾上腺素控制的
that that effect is governed by epinephrine,
从肾上腺释放肾上腺素
adrenaline released from the adrenals
而不是来自大脑
and not from the brain,
因为他们实际上探索了
because they actually explored
效果是否存在
whether or not the effect exists
在所谓的肾上腺切除术的存在下
in the presence of what's called an adrenalectomy,
或去除肾上腺
or removing the adrenals.
所以我应该说没有肾上腺
So I should just say, without the adrenals
你没有得到效果
you don't get the effect.
所以我们知道那种效果
So we know that that effect
来自体内的肾上腺素
comes from adrenaline in the body.
这对你意味着什么？
What does that mean for you?
这意味着如果你想增加
That means if you want to increase
短期内你的免疫系统
your immune system in the short term
你想在短期内增加肾上腺素
you want to increase your epinephrine in the short-term.
这就是为什么剧烈运动会短暂发作的原因
That's why short bouts of very intense exercise
每天可能不超过一个小时
probably no more than an hour per day,
只要你做的其他事情都正确
provided you're doing everything else right,
睡眠和营养等等
sleeping and nutrition, et cetera,
也许短时间的激烈运动
maybe even shorter bouts of intense exercise
或暴露在冷水中
or exposure to cold water,
或我之前所说的循环呼吸法
or that cyclical breathing that I talked about before,
因为它们增加肾上腺素
because they increase epinephrine
它们会增强免疫系统
they will bolster the immune system.
而且我们不时听到这些报告
And we all hear these reports every once in a while,
似乎是这样的事情
it seems to be the thing that
偶尔会有一篇关于如何
every once in a while there'll be an article about how
咖啡可以改善你的免疫系统
coffee can improve your immune system,
或类似的东西
or something like that.
确实咖啡因可以增加肾上腺素
Indeed caffeine can increase epinephrine
和多巴胺在某种程度上
and dopamine to some extent,
但大多数人都在长期饮用
but most people are drinking it chronically.
所以它的作用可能是由于肾上腺素的增加
So its effects are probably due to increases in epinephrine
可能还有像咖啡之类的东西
and probably whether or not something like coffee
或其他形式的咖啡因可以改善
or other forms of caffeine can improve
或降低你的免疫系统
or degrade your immune system
可能取决于是否
will probably depend on whether or not
你正在以某种方式使用它
you're using it in a way
它会增加你的肾上腺素
that it increases your adrenaline as a spike,
只有当你很少喝的时候
that happens rarely,
比如说  每两三个月喝一次
you know, once every two or three months,
假设你感染了病毒
let's say you have an infection coming on,
确实是的
yes, indeed.
这些数据可能意味着
What these data probably mean
就是喝一些含咖啡因的热茶
is that drinking some hot caffeinated tea
甚至一些热咖啡
or some hot coffee even
只要你不脱水
provided you don't get dehydrated from it
因为你也在喝水
because you're also drinking some water
这样可以改善你的免疫系统功能
can probably improve your immune system function,
通过增加肾上腺素释放
by way of increasing adrenaline release.
但是呼吸也可以  冷暴露也可以
But so can the breathing, so can cold exposure,
可以运动
so can exercise.
这里的机制是关键
The mechanism here is what's key,
我一直说
and I keep saying that
因为这意味着
because what it means is that
根本上来讲  你甚至不必知道特定的方法
you don't actually have to know the specific protocol.
我并不是要说要执行此特定方法
I'm not trying to say, do this particular protocol.
你要弄清楚
You have to figure out,
而且应该很容易弄清楚
and it should be easy to figure out
是什么行为短期增加肾上腺素
what short term adrenaline increasing behavior
你愿意每天定期做
you're willing to do on a regular basis every day,
或一周两次或三次
or two or three times a week.
现在你可以说  嗯  我没有病
Now you could say, well, I'm not sick.
我应该经常做这些事情吗？
Should I be doing these things often?
我会说  每周至少两次或三次
I would say, two or three times a week at a minimum
如果你的目标是保持免疫系统调优
if your goal is to keep your immune system tuned up
而且你在很多地方
and you are in the presence of a lot of
例如孩子
children for instance,
很多情况就不适用于他们
which carry a lot of bugs,
因为他们的免疫系统尚未发育
because their immune system isn't developed,
或者你在医疗机构工作
or you work in a healthcare setting,
或者你只是一个容易生病的人
or you're simply somebody who's prone to get sick.
我只能说一句
I can just say anecdotally,
我猜有人现在称这为anecdata
I guess someone now calls this anecdata
我不喜欢那句话
which I don't like that phrase,
因为有点...
because it's sort of...
我不希望轶事数据成为现实
I don't want anecdotal data to ever be
搞的是什么真的数据一样  不是的 经验就是经验
misunderstood as anything but anecdotal data.
有趣的是  我可以说我已经
Anecdotally, I can say that I've had
我感到喉咙发痒的情况
instances where I've felt a throat tickle coming on
或一些鼻窦感染
or some sinus infection,
我将执行我之前描述的循环呼吸
I will do the cyclic breathing that I described before.
25-30呼吸呼气
25, 30 breasts exhale hold,
25-30次呼吸呼气气息  25-30次呼吸呼气气息
25 30 breasts exhale hold, 25, 30 breaths exhale hold,
然后大吸气 屏气
and then big inhale hold.
而且大多数时候我都没有生病
And most times I didn't get full blown sick,
但我也采取其他预防措施
but I also take other precautionary measures
睡觉等等
to get sleep, et cetera.
因此  无论是否有因果关系
So whether or not it was causal,
还是它只是相关的  我不知道
or whether or not it's just correlated I don't know.
但是  有一项人类研究
However, there's a human study
我绝对想向你指出
that I definitely want to point out to you,
因为它是最近出版的
because it was published more recently
比McEwen的作品还重要
than the McEwen work.
它发表在《议事录》上
It was published in the Proceedings
美国国家科学院的
of the National Academy of Sciences for the USA,
因为其他国家也有
because there are Proceedings
国家科学院院刊
of the National Academy of Sciences for many other countries as well.
论文的标题是
The title of the paper is
“交感神经系统的自愿激活...
"Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system."
那是引起战斗或逃跑的压力的系统
That's the system that causes fight or flight AKA stress,
并导致肾上腺素释放
and causes release of adrenaline.
...减弱了人类的先天免疫反应”
"And attenuation of the innate immune response in humans."
这是Kox等 PNAS
This is Kox et al. PNAS,
美国国家科学院院刊  2014年
Proceedings to the National Academy of sciences, 2014.
而且它们结合了著名的Wim Hof呼吸
And they incorporate the ever famous Wim Hof breathing
Wim Hof呼吸很像呼吸方法
Wim Hof breathing is much like the breathing protocol
我在此播客中已经描述了好几次了
that I've described several times now in this podcast.
这也称为“ tummo呼吸”
It's also called tummo breathing.
来自其他文化和社区的其他人
Other people from other cultures and communities
称它为其他东西
have called it other things.
命名确实并不重要
The naming really isn't important.
虽然我确实认为Wim是先锋
Although I do think Wim is a pioneer
将这些做法
in trying to bring these practices
带向了广大公众
to the general public more broadly
并参与了这项研究
and was involved in this study.
该研究在荷兰完成
The study was done in the Netherlands.
它是由耶鲁大学的Tamas Horvath博士主导的
It was communicated by Dr. Tamas Horvath at Yale,
我提到了所有这些
I mentioned all that.
霍瓦斯（Horvath）是一位了不起的科学家
Horvath is a terrific scientist,
我熟悉他多年的工作
I'm familiar with his work over many years.
这就是他们所做的
Here's what they did.
他们给人们注射了大肠杆菌
They injected people with E. coli
他们有一些团体
and they had groups that either
做了我一直在描述的呼吸
did the sorts of breathing I've been describing
增加肾上腺素的释放
that increase adrenaline release.
虽然我应该说
Although I should say,
我不认为你需要呼吸
I don't think you need that breathing
获得肾上腺素释放
to get adrenaline release.
你可以通过冷暴露来做到这一点
You could do it with cold exposure,
你可以用其他东西做
you could do it with other things,
高强度间歇训练也是如此
high intensity interval training as well.
他们发现的是
And what they found was that
对大肠杆菌的反应是完全不同的
the response to the E. coli was quite different
在有方法的人中
in the people that had a protocol,
在这种情况下  呼吸会增加肾上腺素
in this case breathing to increase adrenaline.
所以这是一项了不起的研究
So this is a remarkable study
因为他们发现发烧  呕吐
because what they found was that the fever, the vomiting,
大肠杆菌的所有负面影响
the all the negative effects of E. coli,
他们很多  有些情况下  全部
many of them and some cases all of them
被大大衰减
were greatly attenuated
因为通过使用肾上腺素系统
by way of engaging the adrenaline system.
在这个实验中  受试者使用了呼吸法
In this case using breathing.
他们研究了炎性细胞因子
They looked at inflammatory cytokines,
像IL-6这样的东西
things like IL-6,
我在这个播客中已经提到过很多次了
which I've mentioned many times on this podcast.
这是经典的炎性细胞因子
This are classic inflammatory cytokine were reduced.
减少像IL-10这样的东西
Things like IL-10
也就是抗炎药  让IL-10增加
which are anti-inflammatory were increased.
有一些炎症细胞因子增加
There were some inflammatory cytokines that were increased.
这里有什么意义？
What's the point here?
关键是你可以控制自己的免疫系统
The point is you can control your immune system,
通过寻找增加肾上腺素的方法
by finding a way that you can increase adrenaline.
这与我们一直听到的情况背道而驰
And this runs counter to what we always hear,
压力不要太大  否则你会生病
which is don't get too stressed or you will get sick.
学习控制肾上腺素  将其打开和关闭
Learn to control adrenaline, turn it on and turn it off.
学习控制皮质醇
Learn to control cortisol,
早上把它打开
turn it on with light in the morning,
随着一天的过去
try and turn it off
尝试将其关闭
and then when it spikes because of life events learn to turn it off.
学习开启和关闭肾上腺素
Learning to turn on and off adrenaline, AKA epinephrine,
学习打开和关闭皮质醇
and learning to turn on and off cortisol
使你能够打开精力并集中
affords you the ability to turn on energy and focus
在你的免疫系统中
in your immune system.
这是今天播客中最重要的一点
That's the most important point from today's podcast
一定要理解
and understanding that it doesn't matter
不管你使用什么方法
what protocol you use.
也许是一杯咖啡
Maybe it's a cup of coffee
跑上跑下五六次
and running up a hill five or six times,
可以改善你的免疫系统功能
that will improve your immune system function
如果你的系统中想要有肾上腺素
if you get adrenaline in your system.
你可以用冰浴
You can use an ice bath,
你可以洗个冷水澡
you can use a cold bath,
真的没关系
it really doesn't matter.
你吵个架
You get into an argument,
虽然我不建议你这样做
but I'm not suggesting you do that,
真的没关系
it really doesn't matter.
重要的是你可以关闭
What's important is that you're able to then shut off
该回应
that response.
我们将讨论一些方法
And there are ways to do that we will talk about,
但我想谈谈其他一些好处
but I want to talk about some of the other benefits
肾上腺素和皮质醇
of epinephrine and cortisol
发生是因为它们对大脑的作用
that occur because of their actions on the brain.
因为这些很多而且功能强大
Because these are many and they are powerful,
它们不仅与能量有关  而且与学习能力有关
and they relate to energy, but also the ability to learn.
如果我还没有说服你
If I haven't already convinced you
那天早上见光
that seeing light early in the day
对定时释放你的皮质醇是好的
is good for timing your cortisol.
我还应该提到另一种激素
I should also mention that another hormone
我讨论的最后一集是甲状腺激素
that I discussed last episode which is thyroid hormone
这对设定新陈代谢的水平至关重要
and is critical for setting your level of metabolism
这些生物节律机制部分地控制了
is controlled in part by these circadian mechanisms
和皮质醇本身
and cortisol itself.
简短的结论就是
The short takeaway on this
如果你在一天中的早些时候释放皮质醇
is that if you get your cortisol release early in the day
它会全天增加你的精力
it will increase your energy throughout the day,
它也将使你的甲状腺正常释放
it will also time your thyroid release properly.
所以还有另一个原因
So there's yet another reason
为什么你想得到那个
why you would want to get that light exposure
在一天的早些时候的曝光
early in the day.
对我来说  这是无法商量的做法
For me that's a non-negotiable practice.
如果我在飞机上  我会尽力而为
If I'm on a plane, I'll try and get it any way I can.
即便没有手电筒
I'm not shining flashlights in my eyes yet,
但我真的很努力地
but I really try hard to get that light exposure
不受日光照射的影响
from sunlight early in the day without fail.
甲状腺的增加与以下事实有关：
And the thyroid increase has to do with the fact that
你的昼夜节律时钟本身受皮质醇调节
your circadian clock itself is regulated by cortisol
而甲状腺激素的释放是根据昼夜节律时钟
and the circadian clock times the release of thyroid hormone.
我不想在这里说太多
I don't want to go too far off in that direction,
但是有很多研究
but there are a number of studies,
Kalsbeek等
Kalsbeek et al.
Kalsbeek等 2012
Kalsbeek et al. 2012.
如果你想在PubMed上查找它  那是一个很棒的选择
If you want to look it up on PubMed is a great one,
它描述了皮质醇的分泌
that describes how cortisol secretion
在睡眠期间开始上升
begins to rise during sleep
并在醒来后不久或之前达到峰值
and peaks shortly after waking or immediately before.
在生物钟中有一组神经元
And that times a set of neurons in the circadian clock
然后触发释放
that then trigger the release of the
释放和刺激甲状腺激素
releasing and stimulating hormones for thyroid.
所以一个非常重要的机制
So a really important mechanism,
甲状腺也倾向于与能量相关
and thyroid will also tend to correlate with energy
但主要是新陈代谢
but mostly metabolism.
检查甲状腺非常重要
Very important to have thyroid in check.
现在让我们谈谈肾上腺素和皮质醇
Now let's talk about epinephrine and cortisol,
以及 学习与记忆
and learning and memory.
每个人都有一个关于如此压力的故事
Everyone has a story about being so stressed
他们不记得知识点了
they couldn't remember something.
你知道  坐下来参加考试
You know, sit down to an exam.
一次参加考试  我实际上发生了这种情况
I actually had this happen once sat down to an exam
大脑就是一片空白  一片空白
and just blanked, just blanked.
它只发生了一次  我不知道发生了什么
It only happened once, I don't know what happened.
我不认为这是睡眠不足
I don't think it was sleep deprivation
但是我大脑完全空白
but I just completely blanked.
对我来说很难
And it was very hard for me
把自己从沟里拉出来
to pull myself out of that ditch.
我确实做到了  但这是一次令人恐惧的经历
I did manage to do it, but it was a scary experience.
所以我认为大多数人都在考虑压力
So I think most people think about stress
并且无法执行
and an inability to perform.
但是  大多数时候肾上腺素会增加
However, most of the time increases in epinephrine
只要他们不过高
provided they are not through the roof
可以让我们的学习能力提高
lead to improved performance.
那么  这已经在记忆力测试中一遍又一遍地显示了
Now this has been shown over and over again on memory tests,
学习新信息  身体表现方面的知识
on learning new information, on physical performance.
当肾上腺素的血液水平低时
That when blood levels of epinephrine are low
你表现不佳
you don't perform very well.
当肾上腺素的血液水平很高时
When blood levels of epinephrine are very high
高达约1500至1700 pg / mL
up to about 1500 to 1700 pg/mL.
有人 实际上测量过这些东西
If anyone's out there, who's actually measuring this stuff
但你不一定是这个数
but I doubt you are,
记忆能力提高
performance goes way up.
当你警觉时  学习/记忆能力会提高
Performance gets better when you are alert
当你有点压力的时候
and when you're a little bit stressed.
绝对是一次又一次地展示
Absolutely shown again, and again, and again.
如果你压力太大  那是精神方面
If you get too stressed, it's the mental side,
大脑中的肾上腺素引起人们
it's the epinephrine in the brain that causes people
要么过多地专注于他们的身体反应
to either focus on their somatic response too much.
就像他们觉得自己在流汗一样
Like they feel like they're sweating,
他们专注于身体反应
and they're focused on their bodily response,
他们没有专注于他们想做的事情
they're not focused on what it is they're trying to do,
或说  或执行   或学习等等
or say, or perform, et cetera, or learn.
但是肾上腺素是促智药
But epinephrine is a nootropic,
这是我们所有人内部制造的聪明药
it is a smart drug that we all make internally,
皮质醇也一样
and cortisol is as well.
现在这是转折
Now here's the twist
那并不意味着你要肾上腺素
that does not mean that you want epinephrine
考试期间一定要很高
high during the exam necessarily.
记忆  学习和表现实际上
Memory and learning and performance are actually favored,
肾上腺素的增加最好是学习后的立即升高
they are enhanced by epinephrine increases
学到的东西才会增强
immediately after learning.
那是很少讨论的东西
And that's something that's rarely discussed,
但至关重要
the timing is vital.
因此  如果你了解一些信息
So if you learn some information,
进行了一段对话
you have a conversation
你正在尝试学习一种新的语言  一种新的运动技能
you're trying to learn a new language, a new motor skill.
无论你要学习什么
Whatever it is that you're trying to learn,
紧随其后的肾上腺素增加
the increase in epinephrine that occurs just afterward
那才会巩固信息
is what's going to consolidate the information.
这将确保正确的脑回路
It's going to ensure that the proper circuits
和大脑中神经可塑性的机制
and mechanisms in the brain for neuroplasticity
那天晚上晚些时候在睡眠中
are engaged during sleep later that night
或第二天晚上  才是真正的重新组成
or the next night which is when the real rewiring occurs.
你可能会说：“那太疯狂了  为什么会这样呢？”
And You might say, "That's crazy, why would that happen?"
好吧  我们必须记住
Well, we have to remember,
这些机制都没有发展
none of these mechanisms evolved
让我们做自己想做的事  学习我们必然要做的事
for us to do what we want and learn what we want necessarily
尽管它们将使我们能够做到这一点
although they will allow us to do that.
我们以前曾经历过
We've experienced this before,
我们可能起床  走到外面  坐上我们的车
we might have gotten up, gone outside get in our car,
开车去上班或去别人家
drive to work or to somebody's house
你根本没有想太多
you're not thinking about much at all,
然后突然间  你看到了道路上的事故
and then all of a sudden you see an accident on the road.
你的戒备已准备就绪
Your alertness is primed
如果碰巧是特别血腥的事故
if it happens to be a particularly gory accident,
那里会有很多感官信息
there's going to be a lot of sensory information there.
突然肾上腺素增多
All of a sudden the adrenaline, epinephrine
被释放到你的大脑和身体
is released into your brain and body.
你猜怎么着？
Guess what?
你不仅会忘记那件事
Not only will you not forget that event,
但你会记住导致该事件的所有事件
but you will remember everything that led up to that event
具有自适应功能
which has an adaptive function,
因为你的大脑和身体
because your brain and body's
首先要注意的是安全性  对吗？
primary concern is safety, right?
这是神经生物学的解释
This is the neuro-biological explanation
因为Maslow的需求等级是安全第一
for Maslow's hierarchy of needs is safety first.
因此  你提高了警觉性和警觉性
And so you have heightened awareness and alertness
对于之前的一切
for everything that preceded
肾上腺素和皮质醇上升
that spike in adrenaline and cortisol.
所以思考这个问题的方法是
So the way to think about this is
如果你需要学习更好的东西
if you need to learn something better,
如果你要服用Adderall
if you're taking Adderall,
否则你事先要喝很多咖啡
or you're taking a lot of coffee beforehand
你实际上是在错误的方向上推动这一过程
you're actually driving the process in the wrong direction.
你正在增加肾上腺素以确保确定
You're increasing epinephrine for learning sure,
但超过了某个点
but past a certain point
你实际上在贬低学习和绩效
you're actually degrading learning and performance.
这样做的时间快要结束了
The time to do that is toward the end
或在学习之后
or immediately after the learning,
因为这种机制不仅仅致力于
because this mechanism is not simply devoted to
负面事件  例如车祸或外伤
negative events like a car crash or a trauma,
它可以确保海马体
it works to make sure that the hippocampus
编码记忆的组织
that encodes memories
内存和编码机制的一部分已准备就绪
as part of the memory and coding mechanisms is primed.
告诉你你刚刚经历的事情很重要
That it's told what you just experienced is important,
你稍后将需要该信息
you're going to need that information later.
所以我之前谈论过很多次
And so I've talked many times before about
使用非睡眠深度休息NSDR
using non sleep deep rest NSDR,
或确保学习后睡个好觉
or ensuring good night's sleep after learning.
但是我们在说什么
But what we're also talking about
随着学习活动逐渐减少（即将退出学习）
is as the learning event tapers off, as you're exiting that,
确保你的肾上腺素水平
to make sure that your epinephrine levels
也没有逐渐减少
are not tapering off as well.
这可能是90分钟周期的原因之一
And this may be one of the reasons why the 90 minute cycle,
所谓的学习工作的超级周期
the so-called ultradian cycle for learning works,
因为要花几分钟
because it takes a few minutes
进入学习节奏
to get into rhythm of learning.
你可以保持这种警觉状态约90分钟
You can maintain that alertness for about 90 minutes,
这些播客通常都是巧合
it's no coincidence that these podcasts are typically
大约90分钟长
about 90 minutes long.
当你退出那90分钟
And as you exit that 90 minutes
你将开始感到疲劳
you're going to start to feel fatigued.
你将无法继续
You're not going to be able to continue
以相同水平分泌肾上腺素
to secrete epinephrine at the same level.
所以我不会在这个播客的结尾告诉你
So I'm not telling you that at the end of this podcast
你应该吓自己一下
you should give yourself a foot shock,
或者你应该跳入冰浴
or that you should jump into an ice bath.
虽然我会说
Although I will say,
如果你要增加肾上腺素
if you were to increase your epinephrine
在这集的结尾
at the end of this episode
可以用呼吸或冷水淋浴
by breathing or by way of cold shower,
我愿意打赌  基于大量已发表的研究
I'm willing to bet based on numerous published studies
信息的存储空间将得到增强
that the memory for the information would be enhanced.
由于这种追溯作用
Because of this retroactive effect
肾上腺素和皮质醇
of epinephrine and cortisol.
简而言之  你可以更好地记住事情
Put simply you can remember things better
如果你提高警觉性
if you increase your alertness,
也就是你的肾上腺素和皮质醇水平之后
AKA your level of epinephrine and cortisol after,
在你要学习的东西之后立即
immediately after something that you want to learn.
因此  在Huberman Lab播客中  这里的人提醒我
So I'm reminded by people here at the Huberman Lab Podcast
因此  最佳策略是
that the optimal strategy therefore would be
90分钟的集中精力或学习
a 90 minute session of focus or learning
然后在冷水淋浴或通气式呼吸后
then immediately after cold shower or tummo type breathing,
或冰浴或类似的东西
or ice bath or something of that sort,
也许是一次冲刺
maybe a hard run,
或者做一次HIIT
or hit training if you can't get access to the other things.
然后冲个澡  做个NSDR
And then shower up and do a non sleep deep rest,
然后睡个好觉
and then get a good night's sleep.
这些将是用于增强学习的最佳工具
Those would be the optimal tools and the organization of tools for enhanced learning.
当然可以使用咖啡因
And of course you could use caffeine
在学习播客的尾部
to prime the whole process by drinking the caffeine
通过喝咖啡因来引发整个学习过程
towards the tail of the learning episode,
至少对我来说这是违反直觉的
which is counter-intuitive at least to me.
我应该提到  因为你们中的许多人都使用咖啡因
I should mention since many of you use caffeine
我用咖啡因
and I use caffeine.
我喝咖啡
I do drink coffee,
我喜欢蘑菇咖啡
I love mushroom coffee.
我爱马黛茶
I love mate.
我喝咖啡因和各种形式
I drink caffeine and various forms.
最近有一项研究
There was a study that came out recently
与我们有关精力
that is relevant to our discussion about energy
和机敏  学习的讨论有关
and alertness, and learning.
这项研究刚于2021年3月发布
And the study came out just recently March 2021,
是Maglhaes等
it's Maglhaes et al.
MAGALHAES
So MAGALHAES.
并发表在《分子精神病学》
And it was published in molecular psychiatry
这是一本很好的期刊  是同行评审期刊
which is a fine journal, a peer review journal.
标题几乎把它给丢了
And the title pretty much gives it away,
“习惯性的咖啡饮用者表现出独特的模式
"Habitual coffee drinkers display a distinct pattern
脑功能传导性的问题”
of brain functional conductivity."
长期喝咖啡会改变大脑的传导能力
Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity.
它以多种方式做到这一点
And it does it in a number of ways
但是这项研究的主要收获是
but the key takeaways from this study,
与脑回路的功能有关
as it relates to sort of what the circuits do
与我相反  只是列出了一些脑回路
as opposed to me just listing off a bunch of brain circuits,
在这次对话中这毫无意义
which is kind of meaningless in this conversation
是每天习惯喝咖啡的人
is that people who drank coffee habitually every day
他们的大脑回路发生了变化
had changes in their brain circuitry,
从而使焦虑感发生了转变或偏见
such that there was a shift or a bias toward anxiety
即使他们不摄取咖啡因
even when they don't ingest caffeine.
所以很多时候我们认为
So a lot of times we think,
哦  咖啡因会增加你的焦虑程度
Oh caffeine increases your levels of anxiety.
确实  如果你长期使用它  它确实会出现
And indeed it appears it does if you use it chronically,
不仅限于咖啡因
but not just to caffeine,
它不仅会增加你的焦虑基线
it doesn't just raise your baseline of anxiety
因为你的血液循环
because of what circulating in your bloodstream.
它实际上增加了连通性
It actually increases connectivity
与焦虑有关的大脑区域之间
between the brain areas that relate to anxiety.
现在那可能是好事或坏事
Now that could be a good thing or a bad thing
取决于你如何看待它
depending on how you look at it.
对于那些容易遭受慢性恐慌发作的人
For people that have are prone to chronic panic attacks
或焦虑症的发作将不会是一件好事
or anxiety attacks that's not going to be good.
有些人可能以健康的方式使用咖啡因
Some people might use caffeine in healthy ways.
我相信我是为了
I believe I do in order to
只是提高整体警觉性
just increase overall levels of alertness.
虽然现在我不仅要开始延后
Although now not only am I going to start delaying
我的咖啡因摄入时间  直到我醒来后两个小时
my caffeine intake till two hours after I wake up
由于我在前几集中提到的原因
for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes,
但我也要开始
but I'm also going to start drinking it
稍后在学习和集中讨论之后再喝
later in learning and focus sessions
作为增强可塑性的一种方式
as a way to enhance plasticity
围绕这些学习和重点会议  而不是学习之前喝
around those learning and focus sessions, not before.
如此有趣的研究  它是免费的
So interesting study, it's free online.
你可以在线访问全文
You can access the full paper online,
我们也会放置一个链接
we will put a link as well.
我想提一提益智药
I want to mention this issue of nootropics,
所谓的聪明药
so-called smart drugs.
这不是我特别喜欢的话题
Which is not a topic that I particularly enjoy
因为我不喜欢这个名字
because I don't like the name.
我不喜欢促智的想法
I don't like the idea of a nootropic,
因为什么是聪明药？
because what is a smart drug?
嗯  有各种各样的聪明人
Well, there's different kinds of smart,
有创造力  有任务切换能力
there's creativity, there's task switching,
他们的战略制定  战略实施
their strategy building, their strategy implementation.
还有大多数的促智药
And most of the nootropics that are out there
只是一堆不同的东西的混合物
just cocktails of a bunch of different things
根本不是为个人量身定做的
that aren't tailored to the individual at all.
他们似乎都含有咖啡因
They all seem to have some caffeine,
或一些刺激等等
or some culinary trick stimulation, et cetera.
但是有一个重要的框架
But there's an important way to frame this
根据今天的谈话
in light of today's conversation.
促智药通常分为两类
Nootropics generally fall into two categories,
一类是能增加血糖的促智药
one category are nootropics that increase blood glucose.
这些是人们服用的化合物
So these are compounds that people take
他们增加血糖
they increased blood glucose
并增加血糖
and increasing in blood glucose
将提高学习/记忆能力
will improve performance,
并在某些情况下可以增强学习
and can enhance learning in some situations.
我不是在建议大家吃这些东西
I'm not suggesting people take these things,
但这只是其中一些的列表
but here's just a list of a few of those.
其中一些是合法的
Some of them are legal,
其中一些是灰色地带
some of them are gray market,
其中一些是非法的
some of them are illegal.
吡乙酰胺  奥拉西坦
piracetam, oxiracetam,
阿尼西坦  所有的泰姆斯  好吧
aniracetam, all the Tams, okay.
升高血糖就是它们的工作方式
Elevate blood glucose that's how they work.
你听到的神经效应是继发性或三级的
The neural effects that you hear are secondary or tertiary
他们只是增加了血糖这一事实
to the fact that they just increased blood glucose.
我们知道  因为如果你阻止血糖作用
We know that because if you block the blood glucose effect
你可以阻止促智作用  好吧
you block the nootropic effect, okay.
其他包括  绝对不要接受这些
Others include, and definitely don't take these please,
苯丙胺  可卡因
amphetamine, cocaine.
这些将在短期内增加学习
Those will increase learning in the short term
特别是剂量
in particular dosages,
但是因为它们会增加血糖
but because they increase blood glucose.
然后  当然  诸如刺激性疼痛之类的东西
And then of course, things like painful stimuli
或压力会改善学习
or stress will improve learning
通过增加血糖
by way of increasing blood glucose.
现在与之相关的压力和肾上腺素
Now stress and epinephrine that's associated with it
在学习过程中不仅提高了学习/记忆能力
not only improve performance during the learning about,
但正如我之前提到的
but as I mentioned before
之后激发肾上腺素的升高
having epinephrine come up afterward
将增加该信息/知识的保留
will increase the retention of that information
在长期
in the longterm.
当然  有一整类
And then of course, there's a whole category of
不会影响血糖的促智药
nootropics that don't impact blood glucose,
通过增加胆碱能系统的活性来起作用
that work by increasing the cholinergic system activity.
这些就是胆碱  卵磷脂
And these are things like choline, lecithin,
毒扁豆碱  它是一种处方药
Physostigmine, it's a prescription drug,
磷酸二酯酶
phosphodiesterase.
所以有增加能量的方法
So there're ways to increase energy
不需要增加血糖
that don't require increase in blood glucose,
这是至关重要的
and this is a vitally important.
我们谈论肾上腺素和皮质醇的原因
The reason we're talking about epinephrine and cortisol
增加能量和免疫系统功能
for increasing energy and immune system function
是因为它们在很大程度上与血糖无关
is because they are largely independent of blood glucose.
当然  他们与该系统进行交互
Of course, they interact with that system,
但我们听说成长如此之快  你需要吃能量
but we heard so much growing up you need to eat for energy,
但是我们今天谈论的能量
but the energy that we're talking about today
实际上是一个更强大的
is actually a much more powerful one
而不是你从食物中得到的那一种
than the one that you derive from food,
我们可以称其为神经能
We could call it neural energy.
是神经递质引起机敏
It's neurotransmitters that create alertness,
和专注力  以及行动的意愿和能力
and focus, and the willingness and the ability to move.
以及免疫系统的意愿和能力
And the willingness and ability for immune system
响应入侵者而行动
to move in response to intruders.
所以我认为我们经常将食物视为能源
So I think we all too often think about food as energy
很好  因为它是
which is great because it is,
但是还有其他能源是神经性的
but there are other sources of energy that are neural
它们与这些激素系统有关
and they relate to these hormone systems,
皮质醇和肾上腺素
cortisol and epinephrine.
这就是我们今天重点关注的原因
And that's why we're focused on today.
所以直到现在我们一直在谈论
So up until now we've been talking about
增加能量并增强免疫系统
increasing energy and increasing the immune system
通过皮质醇和肾上腺素
by way of cortisol and epinephrine,
但如果我不涵盖  我将完全被解雇
but I'd be totally remiss if I didn't cover
如果长期升高皮质醇和肾上腺素
how cortisol and epinephrine if chronically elevated,
或如果升高得太高
or if elevated too high
会产生很多不利影响
can have a lot of detrimental effects.
这些是我们通常听到的事情
These are the things we normally hear about.
我将描述其中的一些事情
I'm going to describe some of those things
但我还将讨论改善它们的方法
but I'm also going to talk about ways to ameliorate them.
你可以调节皮质醇水平的方法
Ways that you can adjust the cortisol levels,
即使你有压力
even if you're stressed.
你可以调节肾上腺素水平的方法
Ways that you can adjust epinephrine levels
即使你有压力
even if you're stressed
从而减少负面影响
so that they have less of a negative impact.
我不必一路列出来
I don't have to list off all the ways
压力很可怕  慢性压力很可怕
that stress is terrible and chronic stress is terrible
我想你知道
I think you know.
失眠  随着时间的流逝  你的免疫系统会遭受重创
Insomnia, your immune system over time will get battered
而且你也无法抵抗感染  对吧？
and you won't be able to fight infection off as well, right?
你不想长时间承受压力
You don't want to be stressed for too long.
你可以开始放下
You can start laying down the sort of
皮质醇诱发人体脂肪的经典模式
classic pattern of cortisol induced body fat.
实际上  有很多关于爽心美食的文献
In fact, there's a whole literature related to comfort foods
以及为什么我们要食用“爽心美食”
and why we want to consume comfort foods
在慢性压力下
under conditions of chronic stress.
实际上  这很有趣
And it's quite interesting actually,
因为它揭示了一些东西
because it reveals something
关于慢性应激的生物学
about the biology of chronic stress
这对如何预防它很有帮助
that's informative for how to prevent it,
或在发生慢性压力时降低其压力
or to down regulate chronic stress once it's occurred.
因此  让我们先谈一谈“爽心美食”
So let's talk for a second about comfort foods
和我要参考的工作
and the work that I'm going to refer to
是一位非常出色的科学家完成的工作
is work that was done by a very impressive scientist
以玛丽·达尔曼（Mary Dallman）的名字命名
by the name of Mary Dallman.
她的工作可以追溯到几十年前
Her work goes back decades.
她曾在加利福尼亚大学旧金山分校
She was at University of California San Francisco,
她问了这个问题
and she asked this question
表面上看起来很明显
that on the face of it seems kind of obvious,
但尚无机制
but for which there was no mechanism known
直到玛丽和她的实验室人员来了
until Mary and her lab personnel came along.
问题是
And the question was,
为什么我们要寻找高脂或高糖食品
why do we seek high-fat and or high sugar foods
什么时候有压力？
when we are stressed for awhile?
为什么会这样呢？
Why would that be?
原因是所谓的糖皮质激素
And the reason is that the so-called glucocorticoids
其中皮质醇是糖皮质激素
of which cortisol is a glucocorticoid.
正如我们之前提到的
It's caused as we've mentioned before,
通过从大脑释放激素
by releasing hormones from the brain,
和垂体等的促肾上腺皮质激素
and ACTH from the pituitary, et cetera.
但通常高水平的糖皮质激素会关闭
But normally high levels of glucocorticoid shut off
大脑和垂体中的释放激素
the releasing hormones in the brain and in the pituitary,
它们在所谓的负反馈回路中关闭
they shut down in a so-called negative feedback loop.
所以就像睾丸激素或雌激素过高一样
So just like if testosterone or estrogen get too high
被读出或被看到可以这么说
that's read out or that is seen so to speak
垂体和大脑中的神经元
by neurons in the pituitary and brain
然后我们停止生产
and then we shut down our production of
雌激素和睾丸激素
estrogen and testosterone.
如果皮质醇水平太高
If cortisol levels get too high,
如果皮质醇过多
if there's too much cortisol
漂浮在我们的血液中
floating around in our bloodstream,
有一个负面的反馈回路
there's a negative feedback loop,
以及大脑和垂体关闭  CRH和ACTH
and the brain and pituitary shutdown, CRH and ACTH
否则会刺激更多的皮质醇
which would otherwise stimulate more cortisol,
因此皮质醇水平下降
so cortisol levels go down.
因此  这是一个美丽的负面反馈回路
So it's a beautiful negative feedback loop.
但是  长期压力
Chronic stress however,
持续超过四到七天的压力
stress that lasts more than four to seven days
有一种思考的方法
and there's a way to think about
慢性压力实际上是可以采取行动的
what chronic stress really is in an actionable way,
导致反馈回路发生变化
'causes changes in the feedback loop
在肾上腺和大脑以及垂体之间
between the adrenals and the brain and the pituitary.
这样现在大脑和垂体
Such that now the brain and the pituitary
对高水平的糖皮质激素皮质醇有反应
respond to high levels of glucocorticoids cortisol
通过释放更多
by releasing more of them.
变成正反馈回路
It becomes a positive feedback loop
那很不好
and that's bad
它实际上已经降到了基因调控的水平
it actually gets right down to levels of gene regulation
以及转录和翻译
and transcription and translation.
因此  你真的不想要长期压力
And so you really don't want chronic stress,
因为它是级联的
because it's a cascade of
压力等于更多压力等于更多压力
stress equals more stress equals more stress.
这就是为什么它非常重要的原因
So this is why it's very important
学习关闭压力反应
to learn to turn off the stress response.
你不希望它升高太长时间
You don't want it elevated for too long.
所以有一项研究  达曼和她的同事们做了
So there's one study that Dallman and her colleagues did
他们刺激慢性压力的地方
where they stimulate chronic stress
通过增加皮质类固醇  皮质醇
by increasing corticosteroids, cortisol.
他们发现
And they found that subjects
会增加糖和脂肪的消耗
would increase their consumption of sugar and fat.
实际上他们甚至会吃猪油
In fact they would even eat lard
听起来很恶心
It's sounds disgusting,
但是他们愿意只吃更多的脂肪和更多的糖
but they were willing to just eat more fat and more sugar.
这导致了各种各样的事情
And that led to all sorts of things
像二型糖尿病
like type two diabetes
导致肾上腺输出功能障碍等
that led to dysfunction in the adrenal output, et cetera.
所以真正的关键是学习
And so the real key is to learn
切断压力反应
to shut off the stress response.
因为有趣的是
Because the interesting thing is,
那是主要的同事吗
is that dominant colleagues
根据他们的工作进行的一些研究发现
and some studies that followed up on their work found that
如果系统启动时间过长
if the system was kicked into motion for too long,
整体上  焦虑症发生了巨大的变化
then there was a tremendous shift overall towards anxiety,
因为事实证明体内脂肪本身
because it turns out that body fat itself
接受神经支配
receives neural innervation.
神经元实际上在谈论体内脂肪
Neurons actually talked to body fats
所以现在你体内的脂肪会释放某些激素
so now you have body fat releasing certain hormones,
你的肾上腺释放皮质醇
you've got the adrenals releasing cortisol,
所有这些都回馈大脑
and all of that is feeding back to the brain
让你想要更多的糖和高脂肪的食物
to make you want more sugar and fatty foods.
这就是所谓的“爽心美食”的工作方式
So that's how the so-called comfort foods work.
而且你应该注意自己
And you should watch yourself
下次你遇到压力时
next time you experience stress.
如果这是短期的压力
If it's a short-term about of stress,
通常它可以阻止饥饿
typically it blocks hunger.
如果压力更大
If it's a longer about of stress
通常会引发饥饿
typically it triggers hunger,
特别是对于这些所谓的“爽心美食”
in particular for these so-called comfort foods,
含糖和高脂肪的食物
sugary and fatty foods.
这很有趣
And it's kind of interesting
短期压力如何实际上可以阻止饥饿
how short-term stress can actually block hunger.
它通过激活来实现
It does that by activating
或与称为bombesin系统的系统进行交互
or interacting with a system called the bombesin system.
轰炸素是一种肽激素
Bombesin is a peptide hormone.
我认为它是以某种爬行动物命名的
I think it was named after some sort of reptiles
或两栖动物  对不起  某种蟾蜍
or amphibians, excuse me, some sort of toad.
我认为它最初是从蟾蜍来的
I think it was initially sequenced from the toad
在后来被人类发现之前
before it was later discovered in humans.
我认为蟾蜍的拉丁文名字叫Bombina bombina
And I think the Toad's Latin name is Bombina bombina,
或类似的东西
or something of that sort.
因此  他们决定将其称为“轰炸机”
And so they decided to call this thing bombesin,
但它减少进食并释放压力素
but it reduces eating and stress liberates bombesin
让你想少吃点东西
and makes you want to eat less.
但是长期的压力导致所有这些
But chronic stress causes all these
正向反馈变化  不是积极的
positive feedback changes, which are not positive.
我称他们为正向
I'm calling them positive
因为它们一遍又一遍地放大了压力反应
because they amplify the stress response over and over
不是因为它们对你有好处
not because they are good for you.
所以短期压力很大
So short-term stress great,
长期压力真的  真的很糟糕
long-term stress really, really bad.
我们可以谈论的压力的其他不利影响
Other bad effects of stress that we can talk about
而且我不会列出太多这样的东西
and I won't list off too many more of these,
因为你了解其中的很多知识  所以你会听到有关它们的信息
because you know so many of them, you hear about them.
你真的想知道如何控制他们
You really want to know how to control them I'm guessing
是的  压力确实可以使你头发变白
is that yes indeed stress can make you go gray.
人们头发变白的速度  即白发
The rates at which people go gray, meaning gray hair,
在某些情况下  还有灰白色的头发
some cases gray body hair as well
取决于某些遗传因素
depend on some genetic factors.
有两种方法可以使我们头发变白
There are a couple of ways that we can go gray.
实际上有一个STEM单元
There's actually a STEM cell,
他们在每个卵泡中称之为利基
what they call niche in every follicle.
所以你的卵泡中有STEM细胞
So you have STEM cells in the follicle
可以产生越来越多的给定毛细胞
that can produce more and more of the given hair cell.
它们实际上是过氧化物基团
And they're actually peroxide groups.
你知道我们听说过用过氧化物漂白头发
You know we hear about bleaching hair with peroxide,
至少在80年代是这样
at least in the 80s that was a thing,
但是你可以用双氧水漂白东西
but you can use hydrogen peroxide to bleach things,
你可以在毛囊中产生自己的过氧化物
and you can produce your own peroxide in the hair follicle,
那会导致头发变白
that will cause the hairs to go gray.
除了染发
In addition pigmentation of hair,
就像皮肤的色素沉着一样
just like pigmentation of skin
是受黑素细胞控制的
is controlled by melanocytes,
我们的老朋友  黑素细胞
our old friends, the melanocytes.
我说老朋友  是因为前几集
And I say old friends 'cause on previous episodes
我谈到了为什么阳光和充足的阳光
I talked about why sunlight and getting ample sunlight
可以增加某些物质的水平
can increase levels of certain things
像黑色素细胞刺激激素
like melanocytes stimulating hormone
减少饥饿感
which reduce hunger.
它可以改善睾丸激素和雌激素水平
It can improve testosterone and estrogen levels
以及所有的原因
and all the reasons for that.
好吧  事实证明
Well, it turns out that activation
激活所谓的交感神经系统
of the so-called sympathetic nervous system,
这真的只是它的另一个名字
which is really just another name for
从肾上腺  释放肾上腺素的系统
the system that liberates adrenaline from the adrenals
以及 脑干释放的肾上腺素
and epinephrine in the brain
驱动头发干细胞中黑素细胞的消耗
drives depletion of melanocytes in hair stem cells.
所以确实有一定的老化率
So indeed there's a rate of aging
我们将根据自己的遗传学经历
that we will undergo based on our genetics,
但是压力会使我们头发变白
but stress will make us go gray.
还有你应该看的论文
And the paper that you should look to
如果你想了解更多有关此的信息
if you want to read more about this
最近才出来的
came out very recently.
这是Zang等人  ZHANG等人在《自然》发表
This is Zang et al, Z H A N G et al. Nature.
神话般的期刊  绝对是顶尖期刊之一  2020年
Fabulous journal, definitely one of the apex journals, 2020.
因此  本文表明压力的激活
So this paper showed that the activation of stress
以各种形式会消耗掉这些黑素细胞干细胞
in various forms will deplete these melanocytes stem cells.
你不必担心冰浴
You do not have to worry about an ice bath,
或剧烈运动或呼吸
or hard exercise or breathing,
增加压力水平
increasing your levels of stress
到使你头发变白的地步
to the point where it's going to make you go gray.
我们再次谈论慢性压力
We're talking again about chronic stress.
如果你想抵消压力的影响
And if you want to offset the stress effects
在头发变白的时候  你可以做到
on graying of hair you can do that
通过练习
by either having a practice
帮助你持续调节压力
that helps you regulate stress on a consistent basis.
因此  诸如NSDR或冥想之类的事情
So something like non sleep deep breath, or meditation.
你可以去享受一场很棒的按摩或假期
You can get access to massages or vacations those are great,
但要练习以保持压力
but having a practice to keep stress clamps
这样它不会长期升高
so that it's not chronically elevated,
那也将很棒
that will be great as well.
这是阳光的另一种情况
This is another case where sunlight
我们知道会刺激黑素细胞
we know stimulates melanocytes,
不仅在皮肤上  而且在头发上
not just in skin, but in hair.
因此  获得充足的阳光
And so getting ample sunlight,
有练习调节压力的方法
having a practice to regulate stress
将抵消压力引起的头发纹理
will offset the stressed induced grain of hairs
通过应激诱导黑素细胞耗竭
by way of stress induced depletion of melanocytes.
如果黑色素细胞听起来很像黑色素  那是对的
And if melanocytes sounds a lot like melanin you're right.
那是因为任何与色素沉着有关的东西
That's because anything involved with pigmentation
在大脑和身体中一般都有“黑素”
in the brain and body generally has "melano"
以某种方式位于单词的开头
up in the front of the word in some way or another.
因此  如果长期压力如此严重
So if chronic stress is so bad
因为它对肾上腺素和皮质醇有影响
because of its effects on epinephrine and cortisol
过量了太久
being elevated for too long
那么问题就变成了
then the question becomes of course,
那么  慢性压力是什么？
well, what's chronic stress?
我怎么知道慢性压力
How do I know the difference between chronic
和短期压力的区别？
and acute stress?
我该如何避免长期压力？
And how do I keep chronic stress at bay?
由于所有这些负面影响
Because of all these negative effects,
我甚至没有列出其他的数目
I didn't even list out the number of other ones,
对抑郁症的影响
the effects on depression,
这当然与皮质醇升高有关
which certainly has a correlate with elevated cortisol.
甲状腺激素
Thyroid hormone.
甲状腺激素低与抑郁症有关
Low thyroid hormone is associated with depression.
甲状腺不适时  再次  让光线
Mistimed thyroid, once again getting your light
还有你的饮食  运动和睡眠
and your feeding and your exercise and your sleep
作息一致 规律作息
on a consistent schedule or consistent ish
将是你可以做的最强大的事情
is going to be the most powerful thing you can do
为了缓冲自己
in order to buffer yourself
防止对心理健康的负面影响
against negative effects on mental health
和身体健康
and physical health for that matter.
有些事情可以采取
There are things that one can take
补充剂  处方药等
supplements, prescription drugs, et cetera.
你们当中有些人可能有
Some of you out there may have
或可能认识患有库欣病的人
or may know people that have Cushing's,
这是皮质醇的长期升高
which is chronically elevated cortisol.
我们将谈论一些处方药
There are prescription drugs that we will talk about
可以使用的
that can be used.
但是大多数人正在面对这样的情况
But most people are dealing with a situation where
生活变得压力重  压力减轻
life gets stressful then less stressful,
压力大  然后压力小
stressful then less stressful.
我想说  根据McEwen和其他人的数据
I would say, based on the data from McEwen and others,
鲍勃·萨波斯基（Bob Sapolsky）的实验室已有很多年了
Bob Sapolsky's Lab over many years.
我会说持续的压力
I would say any stress that lasts
如果超过一两天或三天
more than a day or two days, or three days
会开始成为慢性压力
is starting to become chronic stress.
确实没有严格的限制
There's really no strict cutoff
因为我们没有测量每个人的皮质醇
because we're not measuring everybody's cortisol
时不时地
from moment to moment.
我的实验室做了实验
My lab has done experiments
随着时间的推移  我们可以衡量人们的压力
where we measure stress in people over time.
人们千差万别
People vary tremendously
他们有能力度过非常艰难的一天
in their ability to have a really hard day
然后睡着了
and then fall deeply asleep.
这将是最终的重置
That's going to be the ultimate reset
睡个好觉的能力
is the ability to sleep well
每晚或多或少不受干扰
more or less undisturbed each night,
尽管在夜间醒来一两次
although one or two wake ups during the night,
可能不会太有害
probably not going to be too detrimental
只要时间不太长
provided they're not too long,
而且你没有看光
and you're not viewing light
被唤醒 或看你的手机
during those wake-ups or your phone.
但是你可以拿走的东西
But the things that you can take,
如果你觉得自己长期处于压力之下
if you feel like you're chronically stressed
而你正在转向
and you're veering toward
压力的一些负面影响很多
some of the negative effects of stress are many.
人们可以做一些简单的事情
There are some simple things that people can do
在补充方面
in terms of supplementation.
当然所有补品
All supplements of course
必须检查你的安全剂量
have to be checked out for their safety margins for you,
因为人与人之间会有所不同
because there going to differ from person to person.
你有责任确保它们对你安全
You're responsible for making sure they're safe for you
如果你决定使用它们
if you decide to use them.
最常见的一种是Ashwagandha
One of the most common ones is Ashwagandha
具有强大的抗焦虑抗焦虑作用
and it has a powerful anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect.
欢迎你访问省钱网站www.examine.com  费用为零
You're welcome to go to examine.com and for zero cost
你可以看到他们所谓的人类影响矩阵
you can see their so-called human effect matrix.
Ashwagandha有很多用途
Ashwagandha has many uses,
它被用来增强运动员的力量输出
It's been used to enhance power output in athletes
它已经显示出适度增加睾丸激素
it has been shown to modestly increase testosterone.
事实证明  它可以适度地调整诸如
It has been shown to modestly adjust things like
低密度脂蛋白胆固醇
low density lipoprotein cholesterol,
所谓的“坏胆固醇”
the so-called bad cholesterol in quotes.
它对焦虑有深远的影响
It has a profound effect on anxiety
在九项研究中已经证明了这一点
that's been shown in nine studies.
九位同行评审了独立研究
Nine peer reviewed independent studies,
指由没有既得利益的组织资助
mean funded by organizations that have no vested interest
在答案中
in the answer.
它对皮质醇本身具有非常强的作用
It has a very strong effect on cortisol itself.
有多强？
How strong?
人体中皮质醇的减少
The decrease in cortisol noted in humans
减少14.5至27.9％
is 14.5 to 27.9% reduction
在健康但压力重重的人类中
in otherwise healthy but stressed humans.
那太棒了
That's great.
六项研究
Six studies.
它提到有一个更大的
And it mentions there's a significantly larger
比许多其他补品
than many other supplements.
那么  有人会说
Now, some people will say
长期服用Ashwagandha可能不好
that taking Ashwagandha chronically may not be good.
如果你听说过
If you've heard about that,
或者你可以指向特定的研究
or you can point to specific studies
确切说明了为什么它不好
that indicate exactly why it's not good,
请发送到评论部分或让我知道
please put in the comment section or let me know.
最好在YouTube的评论
In the comment section on YouTube would be best.
我指的研究确实探讨了两种性别
The studies that I'm referring to did explore both genders.
受试者人数相当多  达到64位或更多
The number of subjects was reasonably high, 64 or more.
一到六个月的学习
One to six months study,
因此  这些都是长期研究
so these were long-term studies.
太好了  你希望看到
That's great, you like to see that
不只是在一项急性研究中
not just in an acute study.
因此  男性和女性的年龄各不相同
So males and females lots of different ages
超重和非超重
overweight and non overweight.
他们抽了皮质醇的血
They did blood draws of cortisol
这将要结束  以及唾液测试
which is going to end and as well as saliva test.
唾液实际上是测量游离皮质醇的最佳方法
Saliva is actually the best way to measure free cortisol.
你还可以从耳垢中测量出来
You can also measure it from ear wax it turns out
这听起来很恶心 确实
which sounds pretty gross and kind of is.
但是  那是皮质醇积聚的地方
But nonetheless that's where cortisol will accumulate
耳垢和唾液中的游离皮质醇
in earwax and in saliva, the free cortisol.
但这是六个非常高质量的研究
But that's six very quality studies,
独立支持所有指向这些的观点
independently supported that all points to these
你知道  减排幅度非常大  为14.5％至27.9％
very significant, you know, 14.5 to 27.9% reductions
在其他健康的成年人中
in otherwise healthy adults.
因此  如果你是正在应对慢性压力的人
So if you're somebody who is dealing with chronic stress,
这是你生活中的压力时期
it's a stressful period in your life
而你想避免压力带来的负面影响
and you want to stave off the negative effects of stress.
那么ashwagandha可能会
Well then ashwagandha may,
我想强调一点  可能适合你
I want to highlight, may be right for you.
它还确实会降低总皮质醇
It also does tend to lower total cortisol
这很有趣
which is interesting.
它可以将抑郁症降低到最小程度
It can lower depression to at somewhat minimal degree,
并可以像我之前提到的那样降低
and can lower as I mentioned before things like
低密度脂蛋白
low density lipoprotein.
我认为ashwagandha听起来有点
I think ashwagandha comes through is kind of
像是杀手锏补品
the heavy hitter in department.
现在有趣的是
Now what's interesting also
是ashwagandha的其他影响
is the other effects of ashwagandha
在减轻慢性压力和皮质醇的下游
that are downstream of reducing chronic stress and cortisol,
因为皮质醇有很多作用
'cause cortisol has so many effects,
全身和大脑都有皮质醇受体
there're receptors for cortisol all over the body and brain.
因此  我将快速列出这些内容
And so I'll just list these off quickly,
我不会列出每项研究
I'm not going to list off each study
或详细讨论几个主题
or talk about how many subjects in detail.
再说一遍  如果需要  你可以访问examine.com
Again, you can go to examine.com if you want,
并把它放到Ash​​wagandha中
and just put it in Ashwagandha.
参见反应性蛋白
See reactive protein,
这是各种负面健康影响的标志
which is a marker of all sorts of negative health effects.
心血管健康  甚至黄斑变性
Cardiovascular health, even macular degeneration
明显减少
is notably reduced.
心悸明显减少
Heart palpitations notably reduced.
血清T3和T4  我们来自甲状腺激素的老朋友
serum T3 and T4, our old friends from the thyroid hormones
从上一集开始增加
from a previous episode are increased.
强迫症症状减轻
Symptoms of OCD decreased,
痴迷和强迫症
both the obsessions and the compulsion's
痴迷是头脑
right obsessions are of the mind
强迫是行为
compulsions are of behavior.
所以有很多事情在下游
So there are a lot of things that are downstream
减少皮质醇
of reducing cortisol.
降低心率  降低失眠率
Lowered heart rate, lowered rates of insomnia,
记忆力略有改善
slightly improved memory.
我不知道为什么会这样
Why that would be, I don't know,
因为短期内皮质醇可以增加记忆力
because cortisol in the short term can increase memory,
我猜是因为睡眠增加了
I'm guessing it's from increased sleep.
减轻疼痛  提高你的知觉质量...
Decreased pain, increased quality of you know...
减少反应时间  诸如此类
Decreased reaction times, things of that sort.
因此  说不完
So the list goes on and on,
但是所有这些东西都在
but all of those things stem downstream
皮质醇减少的现象下
of decreased cortisol.
因此  如果要决定服用ashwagandha
So if one were to decide to take ashwagandha
为了减少皮质醇
in order to reduce cortisol,
鉴于早晨的皮质醇释放
given that you want cortisol early in the day
能让你全天都有能量
to have energy throughout the day,
所以服用时间大概在一天的晚些时候
the time to take it as probably later in the day
或在晚上
or in the evening.
我从未听说过它会阻止睡眠
I've never heard of it preventing sleep
或引起任何形式的失眠
or causing insomnia of any kind.
那当然没有列出
That certainly wasn't listed
作为对examine.com的主要影响之一
as one of the major effects on examine.com.
我会不时服用ashwagandha
I will take ashwagandha from time to time
如果我长期受到压力
if I'm chronically stressed,
还是如果我的睡眠不如预期
or if I'm not sleeping as well as I ought to.
你可能会以我的全部知识
You might think that with all my knowledge
关于睡眠和睡眠方法
about sleep and sleep protocols
我每天晚上都会睡个好觉
that I would sleep perfectly every night,
但不幸的是我有一条狗
but unfortunately I have a dog that has
狗生涯的落幕  它有痴呆症了
a canine form of of sundowners, of dementia,
所以这些天他整夜都醒着
so he's up much of the night, these days.
所以没有办法
And so there's no way
我最近要睡个好觉
I'm getting a solid night of sleep lately.
因此  我将补充ashwagandha
And so I will supplement with ashwagandha
通常我会在睡前服用
and typically I'll take it before sleep
也许还有我今天的最后一餐
and maybe also with my last meal of the day,
我至少要在入睡的两个小时前
which is at least two hours before I go to sleep.
同样  你必须决定是否适合你
Again you have to decide if it's right for you.
剂量可以相差很大
The dosages can vary tremendously.
我就去买
I would just go buy
知名品牌的瓶子上有什么
what's on the bottle from a reputable brand.
我也要检查一下examine.com
I would also check out examine.com,
因为它提到了一系列剂量
because it mentions a range of dosages
人们使用过的
that people have used.
并在各种研究中得到不同的效果
And in various studies to different effects.
那么  那里有东西
Now, there is something out there
你们当中有些人可能实际上正在摄取或摄取
that some of you may actually be taking or ingesting
可以增加皮质醇
that can increase cortisol
并非偶然
and not so incidentally
可以减少雌激素和睾丸激素
can decrease estrogen and testosterone.
因为记得皮质醇
Because remember cortisol
由胆固醇分子制成
is made from the cholesterol molecule
雌激素和睾丸激素也是如此
so is estrogen and testosterone.
雌激素和睾丸激素也一样  对不起
So are estrogen and testosterone, excuse me,
而且很有竞争力
and it's competitive.
所以你要么制造更多的皮质醇
So you're either making more cortisol,
要么制造更多的性类固醇激素
or you're making more of the sex steroid hormones,
雌激素和睾丸激素
estrogen and testosterone.
信不信由你  甘草
Believe it or not liquorice,
我一直以为是种糖果
which I always thought of as a candy,
但是甘草精含有一种我无法发音的物质
but liquorice contains a substance that I can't pronounce.
甘草N.
G L Y C Y R R H I Z I N.
甘草甜素是植物的草属植物
Glycyrrhizin, which is of the glabra species of plant,
其实是因为它的化学作用
actually because of its chemistry,
这种18-β-羟基胆酸
this 18-beta-hydroxy-cholenoic acid,
你不需要了解所有这些
you don't need to know all that.
甘草  黑甘草中含有一种物质
Liquorice, black liquorice contains a substance
会增加皮质醇
that increases cortisol,
增长幅度不大  但意义重大
and it's increases not huge, but it is significant.
在18至29岁的女性中已经看到了这一点
This has been looked at in females age 18 to 29,
18至29岁的男性和女性
males and females age 18 to 29,
30岁的人
people age 30.
这些是单独的研究
These are separate studies
我列出了不同年龄段的人
where I'm listing off the different ages,
30至64岁
ages 30 to 64.
原来  你可以看到
It turns out that you can see
血清皮质醇显着增加
pretty substantial increases in serum cortisol
并减少睾丸激素和雌激素
and decreases in testosterone and estrogen.
对我来说  也是一个新的知识点
So that was complete news to me.
血压也会升高
Also increases in blood pressure
那是相当可观的
that are pretty substantial.
那将是皮质醇的下游
That's going to be downstream of cortisol,
皮质醇升高  血压升高
increasing cortisol increase blood pressure
为了参与压力反应
in order to engage the stress response
作为压力反应的一部分
as part of the stress response.
其他激素增加
Increased hormones of other kinds
与压力有关
that are associated with stress.
谁知道？
Who knew?
我不知道也许你知道
I didn't know maybe you knew,
以前如果你原谅我
previously if you did forgive me
但是甘草和黑色甘草中的一些化合物
but licorice and some of the compounds in black licorice
实际上会增加压力
can actually increase stress.
可能不是要摄取的东西
Probably not the thing to be ingesting
在慢性压力时期
during periods of chronic stress.
是否有人产生了积极的影响
Whether or not anyone has had positive effects
用它来增加皮质醇和其他情况
of using it to increase cortisol and other contexts,
让我知道
let me know,
但非常有趣的是  甘草的化学成分
but very interesting that the chemistry of licorice
增加压力荷尔蒙
increases stress hormones,
因此  你可能想要
and therefore you would probably want to,
几乎可以肯定  我们要避免这种情况
almost certainly we want to avoid it
在慢性压力的情况下
in conditions of chronic stress.
另外  如果你要优化睾丸激素和雌激素
Also, if you're trying to optimize testosterone and estrogen
甘草精似乎是个坏主意
liquorice seems like a bad idea.
我想你可能要使用甘草的一种情况
I suppose one instance where you might want to use licorice
如果你在旅行
would be if you're traveling
而你正试图在特定位置醒来
and you're trying to wake up at a particular location,
因为甘草对皮质醇有这些作用
because licorice has these effects on cortisol
皮质醇与清醒现象有关
and cortisol is associated with the waking phenomenon
和机敏和精力
and alertness and energy,
你可以在这方面使用它
you could use it in that regard.
但是  我会定时
However, I would be careful to time it
这样你就不会在一天中
so that you're not getting
有两个皮质醇增加  两个高峰
two cortisol increases throughout the day, two peaks.
所以你要确保
So you're going to want to make sure
你正在做所有其他可以纠正时差的事情
that you're doing all the other things correct for jet lag
并调整时差
and adjusting to jet lag.
如果你想知道这些东西是什么
And if you want to know what those things are,
包括定时进食
including timing your feeding,
用温度  用运动
using temperature, using exercise,
用光来更快地调整时差
using light to adjust to jet lag more quickly,
请看我们在时差和班次工作所做的一集
please see the episode that we did on jet lag and shift work
我将详细介绍所有这些方法
where I cover all those protocols in detail.
我认为值得关注的其他化合物
The other compound that I think deserves attention
是芹菜素
is apigenin.
芹菜素  芹菜素
A P I G E N I N, apigenin.
这是在洋甘菊中发现的
which is what's found in chamomile.
我之前已经讨论过的芹菜素
Apigenin I've talked about previously.
它有多种作用  一种是温和的抗雌激素
It has various effects one is it is a mild anti-estrogen
在各种研究中都显示出了这一点
that's been shown in various studies,
而且确实有抗焦虑作用
and it does have a bit of an anxiolytic effect
减轻焦虑
of reducing anxiety.
我睡前服用50毫克
I take it before bedtime, 50 milligrams.
同样  你必须决定
Again, you have to decide
或弄清楚这是否对你安全
or figure out if that's safe for you or not.
我不建议你服用
I'm not suggesting you take it.
作用的主要来源是使神经系统平静
The major source of action is to calm the nervous system.
它主要是这样做的
And it does that primarily
通过调整GABA和氯离子通道之类的东西
by adjusting things like GABA and chloride channels
但它在减少皮质醇方面也有温和的作用
but it also has a mild effect in reducing cortisol.
因此  阿什瓦甘达（Ashwagandha）和芹菜素（Apigenin）在一起
So Ashwagandha and Apigenin together,
我认为最有效的
I would consider the most potent
补充的商业化合物
commercial compounds that are in supplement
可以使用的非处方形式
non-prescription form that one could use
如果他们有兴趣减轻长期压力
if they were interested in reducing chronic stress,
特别是在傍晚
especially late in the day
通过减少一天中的皮质醇
by way of reducing cortisol late in the day.
因此  你可能会得到以下印象：
So you're probably getting the impression that
皮质醇和肾上腺素有点像一把双刃剑
cortisol and epinephrine are a bit of a double-edged sword.
你希望它们升高  但不要持续太久或太多
You want them elevated, but not for too long or too much.
你不希望他们持续好几天  好几天
You don't want them up for days and days, and days,
但你确实想练习
but you do want to have a practice
为了在短期内增加他们
in order to increase them in the short term.
所以我们应该谈谈方法
So we should talk about protocols
可以为皮质醇和肾上腺素奠定基础
that can set a foundation of cortisol and epinephrine
走向最佳
that is headed towards optimal.
优化始终是一系列的
Optimization is always going to be a series
每天进行的常规练习
of regular practices that you do every day.
所以在某些时候睡觉
So sleeping at certain times,
在特定时间点食物  在特定时间点食物
light at specific times, food at specific times.
某些食物等等  这些都是高度个体化的
Certain foods, et cetera, and that's highly individual,
但是有一些共性
but there are some universals
在今天的讨论中  我们已经讨论了很多
and we've covered a number of those in the discussion today.
进餐时间  在能量水平上具有深远的影响
Meal timing, meal schedules has a profound effect on energy levels.
正如我之前提到的
And as I mentioned before
我指的不是葡萄糖能量
the energy I'm referring to is not glucose energy.
它不是在跑步或酮燃烧时燃烧碳水化合物
It's not burning carbs while running or ketones.
我说的是神经能量
What I'm talking about is neural energy,
肾上腺素和皮质醇
epinephrine and cortisol.
禁食和定时吃饭
Fasting and timing one's eating
是同一枚硬币的两个面
are two sides of the same coin.
因此  即使你每天要吃一顿标准的三餐
So even if you're on a kind of standard three meal a day
在饮食之间加一些零食
with a couple of snacks in between diet
或营养方案
or nutrition regimen,
你睡觉的时候都在禁食
you are fasting whenever you're asleep,
或你没有摄取任何卡路里
or you're not ingesting any calories.
因此  除非你迷上了静脉注射葡萄糖
So unless you're hooked up to an IV of glucose
你在睡觉时禁食
you are fasting while you're sleeping.
有几种不同的禁食
There are several different kinds of fasting
可能与肾上腺素和皮质醇有关
that can relate to epinephrine and cortisol.
我将整集介绍如何优化食物摄入量
I will do an entire episode on optimizing food intake
在运动环境中的表现
for performance in the sports context.
即将到来  但与此同时
That's coming up but in the meantime,
我只想谈一谈
I'd like to just talk about
空腹作为肾上腺素的来源
fasting as a source of epinephrine.
任何时候我们的血糖低
Anytime when our blood glucose is low
皮质醇和肾上腺素将上升
cortisol and epinephrine are going to go up.
如果我们禁食太久  那就是压力
If we fast for too long, that is stress.
没有办法解决
There's no way around that.
现在这并不意味着它没有
Now that doesn't mean it doesn't have
其他有益效果
other beneficial effects.
跑马拉松是压力
Running a marathon is stress,
但是如果那是你的事  它也会产生积极的影响
but it can also have positive effects if that's your thing.
因此  压力已被妖魔化为一个名词
So stress has been demonized as a term,
但是我们要机制地考虑压力
but we want to think about stress mechanistically,
如肾上腺素和皮质醇
as epinephrine and cortisol.
然后  如果我们这样做
And then if we do that
我们可以考虑如何调整时间
we can think about how to regulate its timing.
所以任何时候我们四到六个小时没吃东西
So anytime we haven't eaten for four to six hours,
肾上腺素和皮质醇的水平
levels of epinephrine and cortisol
将会大幅上升
are going to go up pretty substantially.
有一个例外
There's an exception to that,
如果你习惯于吃饭
which is if you are used to eating
每两个小时或每小时一次
on the clock every two hours or every hour
迟到了半小时
being half hour late,
甚至比原定计划晚10分钟
or being even 10 minutes late on that schedule
会引起压力
will induce stress.
大多数的心理压力
Most of that psychological stress,
而且还会释放诸如ghrelin之类的东西
but also the release of things like ghrelin
会让你饿
that are going to make you hungry,
因为他们在那个吃饭的钟上
'cause they're on that eating clock.
因此  很多人都从中受益匪浅
So one thing that many people do to great benefit
他们遵循所谓的昼夜节食时间表吗？
is they follow a so-called circadian eating schedule.
他们只有在太阳升起的时候才进食
They eat only when the sun is up,
他们在太阳下山时停下来
they stop when the sun is down.
或多或少
More or less.
考虑这个的另一种方式
The another way to think about this
他们在睡觉前几个小时就停止进食了吗
is they stop eating a couple hours before sleep
他们醒来或多或少地吃东西
and they eat more or less upon waking
假设他们正在醒来
assuming that they're waking up
在日出的时候或多或少
more or less around the time of the sunrises,
大概正负两个小时
maybe plus or minus two hours.
好的所以有点典型的时间表
Okay. So sort of typical schedule.
那么  假设你决定做我要做的事
Now, let's say you decide to do what I do,
我不吃早餐
which is I skip breakfast.
我喝水
I drink water,
我将咖啡因延迟90分钟到两个小时
I delay my caffeine for 90 minutes to two hours,
然后我喝咖啡因
and then I drink my caffeine.
然后我的第一顿饭通常是在午餐时间
And then my first meal is typically around lunchtime,
11:30或12:00
11:30 or 12:00.
是的  偶尔我会吃点别的
And yes, occasionally I throw back
一些杏仁或核桃  在当天早些时候
some almonds or walnuts or something earlier in the day.
我不时这样做
I do do that from time to time
如果我够饿的话
if I get hungry enough,
或者如果我碰巧看到它们
or if I just happen to see them.
被饿死鬼附体了
I'm kind of a drive by eater,
如果我看到蓝莓或坚果之类的东西
if I see blueberries or nuts or something
我只是看到  就会要把它们捡起来放在嘴里
I'm just going to pick them up and put them in my mouth.
我尽量不要在别人的盘子面前那样做
I try not do that off other people's plates,
但是我只是有不时这样做的习惯
but I just have that habit of doing that from time to time.
但是通常我要到中午才吃东西
But typically I don't eat until about noon.
所以我的皮质醇增加了
So I've got a cortisol increase
我早上会去吸收阳光
I've got my sunlight in the morning.
因此  在一天的早些时候  我得到了很大的动力和精力
So I'm getting a big pulse and energy early in the day.
是的  有点激动
And yes, there's a little bit of agitation,
有时候我很饿  有时不饿
I am hungry sometimes early in the day sometimes no,
但是我的生长素释放肽系统习惯于
but my ghrelin system is used to
正午时分开始分泌
kicking in right around noon.
在我吃饭的地方
At the point where I eat
只要我不吃碳水化合物
as long as I don't eat carbohydrate
就我而言  我知道我的肾上腺素水平
in my case, I know that my epinephrine levels
会保持很高的水平
are going to stay pretty high.
所以对我来说  通常是肉和沙拉
So for me, it's usually meat and salad,
或类似的东西  或鱼和沙拉
or something of that sort, or fish and salad.
虽然我不特别喜欢吃鱼
although I don't particularly like eating fish
因为味道
because of the taste,
但我假设是低碳水化合物或酮类
but I'm assuming low carb or ketones ish
吃一整天
throughout the day.
所以我可能全天处于肾上腺素和皮质醇稍微升高的状态
So I'm probably in a slightly elevated state of epinephrine and cortisol throughout the day.
你们中有些人禁食的时间更长
Some of you are fasting even longer.
你要推迟到4:00 PM或8:00 PM
You're pushing out till 4:00 PM or 8:00 PM,
甚至你甚至全天都在禁食
or maybe you're even fasting around the clock.
任何时候你禁食
Anytime you're fasting
你正在增加肾上腺素和皮质醇的释放
you're increasing epinephrine and cortisol release.
你可以做世界上所有的冥想
You can do all the meditation in the world
保持头脑冷静
to keep your mind calm,
但你更接近压力的边缘
but you are closer to that edge of stress.
而且你更接近峰值应力的边缘
And you're closer to that edge of peak stress.
所以这是很重要的要了解的东西
So that's something that's just important to understand
关于“爽心美食”和皮质醇的描述
the description about comfort foods and cortisol
是一种极端的情况
was one of kind of an extreme case
皮质醇系统
where cortisol systems
进入正向反馈循环
kick over to a positive feedback loop.
但是我们都吃抑制皮质醇和肾上腺素
But we all eat to suppress cortisol and epinephrine.
当我们饥饿时  皮质醇和肾上腺素
When we're hungry cortisol and epinephrine
引起不安  所以我们去寻找食物
create an agitation so we go seek food.
当我们摄取食物时
When we ingest food
通常  如果其中包含碳水化合物
typically if it includes carbohydrate,
皮质醇水平下降
there's a blunting of cortisol.
血液中的肾上腺素水平下降
There's a blunting of epinephrine in the bloodstream.
如果你喝太多咖啡
If you've ever had too much coffee to drink
然后你去吃几片面包
and you go and have a couple of pieces of bread,
你会感觉到...
you will feel the...
你可能将其描述为咖啡因
You might describe it as the caffeine
被系统吸收
getting soaked up out of your system,
但是你在做的是升高血糖
but what you're doing is you're elevating blood glucose
这或多或少是饱和的
which is more or less saturating
咖啡因对你系统的影响
the effect of caffeine in your system.
不完全是  但是它将产生这种效果
Not completely, but it's going to have that effect.
如果你压力很大  坐下来吃点东西
If you're very stressed and you sit down to eat something
它会使你平静下来
it will calm you down.
是的因为一些血液流到你的肚子
Yes. Because some of the blood that goes to your stomach
但更多的是由于这些影响
but more so because of these effects
会减弱皮质醇和肾上腺素
in blunting cortisol and epinephrine.
所以这里的重点是
So the important point here is that
如果你想保持警惕
if you want to be alert
你可以不吃东西来做到这一点
you can do that by way of not eating.
当然  请摄取液体
Of course, please ingest fluids.
我知道有些人在那里喝水进食
I know some people water fast out there.
我尚未见到有关喝水禁食的科学知识
I am yet to see good science on water fasting
以及为什么它可以刺激干细胞
and why that can stimulate stem cells,
或人们喜欢这个主意
or people love the idea of
自从自噬这个概念获得诺贝尔奖后
after the Nobel prize was given for autophagy
这个概念是我们的​​细胞可以清理碎屑
and this idea that our cells clean up debris
是的  这是事实
in senescent cells, yes, that's true.
但是喝水禁食的想法是否能够促进这一点
But the idea that water fasting is going to promote that,
我觉得很有趣
I find rather amusing.
请发送相关数据给我
Please send me the data
如果你知道在一本不错的期刊上有刊登过一些出色的研究
if you know of some great study in a decent journal,
但这几乎是我所听到的
but pretty much this is something I hear about.
我不认为喝水禁食是个好主意
I don't think water fasting is a good idea,
你也不应该喝那么多水
nor should you be drinking so much water
那会让你丢掉性命的
that you kill yourself.
实际上  你可以喝足够多的水以致死亡
You can actually drink enough water that you die.
所以我认为摄入健康量的水
So I think ingesting water in healthy amounts
是一件好事  保持水分
is a good thing, stay hydrated.
但是  如果你想保持机敏  请保持水分
But if you want to be alert stay hydrated,
咖啡因用不用都可以
caffeine may or may not be in your regimen,
但禁食可以确保你的能量/精力水平升高
but fasting will make sure that your levels of energy are up
而且你会做得很好
and you will be primed very well for doing
我们在此播客的早期谈论的那种方法
a protocol of the sort that we talked about earlier in this episode.
呼吸  冷暴露或运动
Of breathing, or cold exposure, or exercise
增强免疫系统功能
to get that increase in the immune system function.
如果你在学习之后就这样做了
And if you do that after learning
尝试学习一些东西之后
after trying to learn something,
它将增加学习
it will increase learning
对于那组特定的信息
for that particular set of information,
不管是运动还是语言
whether or not it's motor, or language,
或碰巧是什么其他的
or whatever it happens to be.
数学  程序设计
Mathematics, programming.
因此  禁食是多种原因的工具
So fasting is a tool for many reasons,
它可以增加生长激素  等等
it can increase growth hormone, et cetera.
但是今天我在谈论禁食作为一种工具
But today I'm talking about fasting as a tool
更多偏向
to bias your system toward more
你肾上腺素释放的系统
epinephrine adrenaline release
并向皮质醇释放更多
and toward more cortisol release
但仍然足够低  这不是长期的压力
but still low enough that it's not chronic stress,
不会对健康造成负面影响
that it's not causing negative health effects.
但是请知道  如果生活非常非常压力
But please know that if life is very, very stressful
如果你遇到很多压力源
if you're experiencing lots of stressors
而且你长期禁食
and you're chronically fasting,
你将自己定位于更大的
you are positioning yourself toward a greater likelihood
长期压力可能性下
of being chronically stressed
这是负面的
in the ways that are negative.
对生殖途径有负面影响
Negative effects on the reproductive access,
降低睾丸激素和雌激素
lower testosterone and estrogen.
对头发的负面影响  头发会变白
Negative effects on you're hair will turn gray,
这是有原因的
there's reasons for that,
你的睡眠会受到影响
Your sleep will suffer.
你的免疫系统会受到损害
Your immune system will suffer.
所以我认为虽然细微之处
So I think while it's nuanced
今天我们关于肾上腺素和皮质醇的讨论
our discussion today about epinephrine and cortisol
增强精力和抵抗力旨在帮助你
increasing energy and immunity are designed to help you
了解何时应该做某些事情
understand when you should be doing certain things.
什么时候应该“减油门”
When you should throttle back.
当你可能想稍微刺激一下肾上腺素时
When you might want to kick up your adrenaline a bit,
如果你正处于低能量状态
if you're suffering from low energy
因为你只是有点沮丧
because you're just kind of feeling down
有点没动力
and a little bit under activated,
那么用冰浴
well then the practices of ice baths
剧烈的呼吸等等
and intense breathing, et cetera,
可能非常有益  也可能是禁食
could be very beneficial so might fasting.
但是  如果你感到精疲力竭和精疲力尽
But if you're feeling exhausted and burnt out
有点筋疲力尽
sort of drained and stressed
好吧  然后禁食或进行大量的冷暴露
well then fasting or doing a lot of cold exposure,
或做剧烈运动
or doing a lot of intense exercise
那会使你越来越陷入慢性压力
is driving you further and further into chronic stress.
因此  因为我没有唾液检查或血液检查
So because I don't have a saliva test or a blood test,
或...上帝原谅我...  耳垢测试来测量你的皮质醇
or God forbid an earwax test to measure your cortisol
当我们一起参与讨论时
as we're engaging in this discussion together,
你必须自己衡量
you have to gauge for yourself
你是否处于未激活状态
whether or not you are in a state of under activated
是否需要更多的肾上腺素和皮质醇
and need more epinephrine and cortisol,
或你是否过度活跃
or whether or not you are over activated,
就皮质醇和肾上腺素而言
in terms of cortisol and epinephrine.
如果你需要缓冲  那么ashwagandha这些方法
And you need ways to buffer those ashwagandha,
也许应该是温暖的泡泡浴  而不是冰浴
Maybe it should be a warm mellow bath not an ice bath.
所以必须学习如何调节这些激素
So one has to learn how to regulate these hormones
用行为  用营养
with behavior, with nutrition,
也许用补剂
perhaps with supplementation.
当然还有处方药
And then of course there are prescription drugs,
我总是把这些留到最后
and I always leave these to the end
因为我不是医生
because A, I'm not a medical doctor
我不开任何处方
I'm not prescribing anything.
我是教授
I'm a professor,
我讲道理
I'm professing a number of things
你可以自行决定如何处理
that you can decide for yourselves what to do with or not.
但是当然有处方药
But of course there are prescription drugs
可以增加皮质醇或减少皮质醇
that can increase cortisol or decrease cortisol
在诸如库欣氏综合症的情况下
in cases like Cushing's syndrome,
如果你已诊断出该问题
which if you have that diagnosed,
你应该和医生谈谈
you should talk to a physician.
你应该理想地与内分泌学家交谈
You should talk ideally to a endocrinologist
但对于某种医师
but to a physician of some sort,
董事会认证的医师
board certified physician.
有可以用来治疗伤害的药物
There are drugs that can be used to treat injury
像皮质类固醇
like corticosteroids,
你可以注射以减轻炎症损伤
that you can inject to reduce inflammation injury,
但它们是皮质醇
but they are cortisol.
所以他们会让你偏向更大的压力
So they're going to bias you towards more stress
在其他领域
in other domains.
记住皮质醇可以穿过血脑屏障
Remember cortisol can cross the blood brain barrier
因此你将更容易遭受心理压力
so you're going to be more prone to psychological stress.
我也想再提一遍
I also want to mention again,
我认为练习有很大的好处
that I think there's great benefit to having a practice
也许你隔天做一次
that perhaps you do every other day,
但是如果你不能每隔三天或隔天
but if you can't maybe every third day or every other day
故意增加体内的肾上腺素
of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body
在学习保持头脑冷静的同时
while learning to stay calm in the mind,
让你学会分开大脑和身体的体验
so that you learn to separate the brain body experience.
你知道吗  我们听到了很多关于它有多好处的信息
You know, we hear so much about how beneficial it is
统一大脑和身体
to unify the brain and body,
我们都与大脑和身体失去联系
that we're all out of touch with our brain and bodies.
我特别不喜欢这样的说法
I particularly dislike claims like that
或类似的陈述
or statements like that
因为今天我们学到了强大的力量
because there's great power as we learned today
通过某种刺激来激活你的身体
in having your body activated by some sort of stimulus,
冷水甚至心理压力
cold water or even psychological stress,
但要学会保持头脑冷静
but learning to stay calm in your mind.
我应该提醒你  大部分
I should just remind you that most of the
对你和他人生命的负面影响
negative effects on your life and on the lives of others
是因为别人  也许你我希望不是
are due to people perhaps you I hope not
无法调节自己的思想
being unable to regulate their mind
当他们体内的肾上腺素含量高时
when they have high levels of adrenaline in their body,
要么因为他们在网上看了一些东西
either 'cause they read something on a text
或评论部分
or a comment section,
当然  这永远不会发生在我身上
of course that never happens to me,
但它可能会发生在你身上
but it may happen to you.
骗你们的 当然会发生在我身上
Of course it happens to me,
但重要的是  保持头脑冷静
but the idea is to stay calm in your mind
这样你就可以控制自己的行为了吧？
so that then you can regulate your action, right?
所以我认为有这些做法
And so I think that there are these practices
随着时间的流逝可以发展
that one can develop over time
真的很简单  零成本  对吧？
that are really straight forward and zero costs, right?
你可以找到许多方法
You could find any number of ways
增加你的肾上腺素并保持冷静
to increase your adrenaline and stay calm.
而且我们倾向于专注于运动之类的事情
And we tend to focus on things like exercise
作为我们增强精力的方式
as the way that we get our energy up.
但是今天  我再次谈论
But today, again I'm talking about
故意增加肾上腺素
deliberately increasing adrenaline
在精神上保持冷静的同时
while staying calm mentally,
因为那很有用
because that has great utility
当肾上腺素在不需要的事件中升高时
when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events,
通过我们没有发现的事情
through things that we didn't seek out.
因此  调节肾上腺素皮质醇的能力
So the ability to regulate adrenaline cortisol
关于故意诱导他们
is about inducing them deliberately
当你想阻止感染时
when you want to push back on infection,
细菌病毒的潜在感染
potential infection from bacteria viruses.
这是关于肾上腺素和皮质醇的撤退
It's about pulling back on adrenaline and cortisol,
也许通过补剂的使用
maybe through the use of supplementation
但肯定是通过适当使用光线和睡眠
but certainly through proper use of light and sleep
和我们讨论过的心理工具
and mental tools that we talked about as well
当他们长期升高时
when they are chronically elevated.
这是关于训练你的系统
It's about training your system,
不只是要统一在大脑和身体上
not just to be unified at brain and body,
听起来很不错  直到你承受压力为止
which sounds great until you're stressed
那太可怕了
and then that's terrible.
这实际上是有意分离
It's really about having a deliberate dissociation
肾上腺素的肾上腺素反应之间
between the adrenaline response from the adrenals
以及来自脑干的肾上腺素反应
and the adrenaline response from the brainstem.
因此  我们再次涵盖了很多材料
So once again, we've covered a ton of material.
我希望那么  你在想
I hope right now, you're thinking,
好吧  我处于慢性压力状态吗？
okay, am I in state of chronic stress?
我被激活了吗？
Am I under activated?
还是我有能力提高自己的水平
Or could I afford to increase my levels
肾上腺素皮质醇改善我的关系
of adrenaline cortisol to improve my relationship
对我的免疫系统和能量  神经能量
to my immune system and to energy, neural energy.
如果你喜欢今天听到的内容
If you like the information that you heard today
而你想记住它
and you want to remember it,
好吧  那么在这集的结尾
well, then at the end of this episode,
也许你去做点什么
perhaps you go do something
增加你的肾上腺素水平

or you could apply that to anything else
你学习或经历的课程
that you learn or experience of course.
我希望你会考虑
And I hope that you'll think about
皮质醇和肾上腺素的一些方法
some of the ways in which cortisol and adrenaline
无论好坏  压力好坏
are not good or bad, that stresses in good or bad
但短期压力是健康的
but short-term stress is healthy.
机敏和精力健康
Alertness and energy is healthy
即使它使你处于激动的边缘
even if it puts you at the edge of agitation,
那是一个机会
that's an opportunity
学习如何更好地控制这些激素
to learn how to control these hormones better.
我希望如果你处于长期压力状态
And I hope that if you're in a state of chronic stress
你会做的事
that you'll do things
开始减轻一些压力
to start tamping down some of that stress
并且你意识到你的神经系统
and that you realize that your nervous system
和你的荷尔蒙系统有联系
and your hormone system are linked,
但是它们以你可以控制的方式链接在一起
but they're linked in ways that you can control,
我们不必成为荷尔蒙的奴隶
that we don't have to be slaves to our hormones.
当然不是引起我们压力的激素
And certainly not the hormones that cause us stress,
我们可以学习控制那些
we can learn to control those
都有利于我们的身体
both to the benefit of our body
和精神上的好处
and benefit of mind.
