-欢迎来到HubermanLab播客
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
我们在这里讨论科学和基于科学的日常生活工具
where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
我是安德鲁·休伯曼  斯坦福大学神经生物学
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
以及医学院的眼科教授
and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
本播客与我在斯坦福大学的教学和研究角色是分开的
This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
然而  这是我的愿望和努力的一部分
It is however, part of my desire and effort
为消费者提供零成本信息
to bring zero cost to consumer information
关于科学和科学相关工具
about science and science related tools
向公众开放
to the general public.
为了与这个主题保持一致
In keeping with that theme,
我要感谢今天播客的赞助商
I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
我们的第一位赞助商是“InsideTracker”
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
InsideTracker是一个个性化的营养平台
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
分析你的血液和DNA数据
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
帮助你更好地了解你的身体
to help you better understand your body
帮助你实现健康目标
and help you reach your health goals.
我做血液检查已经很多年了
I've been getting my blood work done for many years now,
原因很简单
and that's where the simple reason
只有通过高质量的血液检测
that only through quality blood work,
现在随着DNA测试的出现
and now through the advent of DNA test
我们真的能得到一个清晰的画面吗
can one really get a clear picture
他们的健康状况
of what's going on with their health.
比如代谢因素和荷尔蒙
Things like metabolic factors and hormones,
各种甘油三酯
all the various triglycerides.
这些都是只能测量的东西
These are things that can only be measured
验血的结果
from a quality blood test.
现在有了DNA测试
And now with DNA tests,
你可以获得额外的窗口
you can get an additional window
你现在的健康状况
into your current health status
以及你的健康轨迹
and the trajectory of your health.
“InsideTracker”的真正精彩之处在于
What's really wonderful about InsideTracker
你是说你不能只拿回数字吗
is that you don't just get numbers back
各种荷尔蒙的具体水平
about the specific levels of various hormones
和代谢因素,
and metabolic factors,
你也会得到很多关于
you also get a lot of information about
为了调整这些数字  你可以或者应该做什么
what you could or should do in order to adjust those numbers
让你走上健康之路
to put you on the course to better health.
例如  它会给出建议
So for instance, it will give recommendations
关于该吃或不该吃的特定食物
about particular foods to eat or avoid,
特定的运动方案
particular exercise regimens
你可能会想要收养
that you might want to adopt
以及这些疗法的频率
and the frequency of those regimens
以便将这些标记移向正确的方向
in order to move those markers in the correct direction.
InsideTracker还增加了一个新功能
InsideTracker has also added a new feature
这使得跟踪你的进步
that makes tracking your progress
分析你的数据会更容易
and analyzing your data even easier.
对于那些使用Garmin健身追踪器的人
For those of you that use a Garmin fitness tracker
比如Garmin手表
such as the Garmin watch,
现在与他们的平台兼容了
that's now compatible with their platform.
这样你就可以把数据和Garmin的数据结合起来
So you can couple your data from your Garmin
用你的血液和DNA进行更个性化的研究
with your blood and DNA for even more personalization
以及对你健康的看法
and insights on your health.
然而  如果你没有Garmin设备
However, if you don't have a Garmin device,
你仍然可以从“InsideTracker”那里得到很多信息
there's still a lot that you can get from InsideTracker
和他们的测试
and their tests.

今天的播客也是如此
Today's podcast is also brought to us
ExpressVPN
by ExpressVPN.
ExpressVPN是一种虚拟专用网络
ExpressVPN is a virtual private network
保证你的数据安全和隐私
that keeps your data secure and private.
它通过路由你的互联网活动来做到这一点
It does that by routing your internet activity
通过他们的服务器进行加密
through their servers and encrypting it,
这样就没人能看到或出售你的数据了
so that no one can see or sell your data.
我很熟悉不保护我的数据的后果
I'm familiar with the effects of not securing my data
很好
well enough.
几年前  我的银行账户被黑了
A few years back I had my bank accounts hacked.
我不知道具体是怎么发生的  但确实发生了
I don't know exactly how it happened, but it happened.
工作量太大了
And it was a terrible amount of work
把它倒过来并固定好
to have that reversed and secured.
ExpressVPN最棒的地方就是我都没注意到
The great thing about ExpressVPN is I don't even notice
这是跑步
that it's running.
我电脑里有
I have it on my computer,
我在家工作的时候就会打开它
I turn it on anytime I work at home
或者在旅行时  或者在机场的咖啡馆里
or when traveling or in a cafe airport anywhere,
它在后台运行
and it runs in the background,
它不会改变任何关于接口的内容
it doesn't change anything about the interface
用我的电脑或无线网络
with my computer or the wifi.
它保护了我的数据和所有信息
It just secures my data and it secures any information
我碰巧在找什么  等等
about what I happen to be searching for, et cetera.
我觉得我没有什么特别要隐瞒的
I don't feel like I have anything particular to hide
除了我的银行账户密码之类的东西
except my bank account passwords and things of that sort.
但有了ExpressVPN  一切都变得安全了
But with ExpressVPN, it basically makes everything secure,
你不会被追踪  也没人能进入
you can't be tracked and no one can access
或者窃取你的数据  这太棒了
or steal your data, which is terrific.
所以  我在旅行和在家的时候都会用到它
So again, I use it when I'm traveling and when I'm at home.
如果你想开始保护你的互联网活动
If you want to start protecting your internet activity
使用ExpressVPN  你可以登录www.expressvpn.com/huberman
using ExpressVPN, you can go to www.expressvpn.com/huberman
而且你还可以额外免费三个月
and you'll get an extra three months free
为期一年
on a one-year package.
在www.expressvpn.com/huberman上可以免费3个月
That's www.expressvpn.com/huberman to get three months free
在他们的任何一年的计划
on any of their one-year packages.
今天的播客也是由Athletic Greens提供的
Today's podcast is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
运动绿是一种综合性维生素
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,
矿物,益生菌饮料,
mineral, probiotic drink,
这给了你一个完整的维生素和矿物质基础
that gives you a total foundation of vitamins and minerals
和益生菌来支持你的健康和幸福
and probiotics to support your health and wellbeing.
我从2012年开始使用Athletic Greens
I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012.
所以我很高兴他们能赞助这个播客
And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
我开始使用Athletic Greens
I started using Athletic Greens
我仍然每天使用一到两次Athletic Greens
and I still use Athletic Greens once or twice a day
因为这是最简单最直接的方法
because it's the simplest and most straightforward way
来补充重要的维生素和矿物质
to get my basis of important vitamins, minerals
益生菌也没有了
and probiotic taken care off.
所有这些东西结合起来支持各个方面
All of those things combined to support various aspects
我的健康,
of my health,
比如大脑健康  比如肠道健康
such as brain health, such as gut health.
例如  现在有大量的证据
For instance, there's a tremendous amount of evidence now
表明益生菌支持肠道健康
showing that probiotics support gut health
肠道大脑的通路对一些事情很重要
and that the gut brain access is important for things like
专注和认知  以及免疫功能
focus and cognition, as well as for immune function
以及身体健康的各个方面  比如新陈代谢
and various aspects of physical health, like metabolism.
这样的例子不胜枚举
The list sort of goes on and on.
绿色运动,
With Athletic Greens,
它含有所有这些维生素和矿物质
it has all these vitamins and minerals
以及其他对我有好处的东西
and various other things that are good for me,
我真的很喜欢它的味道
and I actually really liked the way it tastes.
所以我每天用一次
So the way I use it is once a day,
有时一天两次
sometimes twice a day,
我把它和水混合
I'll mix it up with water,
我加一点柠檬或酸橙汁
I add a little bit of lemon or lime juice.
我觉得不加柠檬或酸橙汁的味道很好
I think it tastes great without the lemon or lime juice.
但当我加进去的时候  我觉得真的很好吃
But when I add that, it's truly delicious to me.
我今天第一件事就是喝它
And I'll drink that first thing in the day,
上午有时相反
mid-morning sometimes instead
有时下午晚些时候再来一次
and sometimes again in the later afternoon.
我今天晚些时候还能喝杯绿色运动饮料
I'm able to drink Athletic Greens late in the day
别让它让我睡不着
and not have it keep me awake.
如果你想试试绿色运动
If you want to try Athletic Greens,
你可以登录www.athleticgreens.com/huberman
you can go to www.athleticgreens.com/huberman,
如果你这样做了  你可以要求一个特别优惠

他们会给你五个免费的旅行包
They'll give you five free travel packs,
是什么混合在一起的
which make mixing up Athletic Greens
当你在路上的时候  真的很简单
while you're on the road, really simple and easy.
他们会给你一年的维生素D3+K2
And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3+K2.
维生素D3  大家都知道
Vitamin D3, as many of you know,
你可以从太阳
you can get from the sun,
但是很多人  即使他们已经
but many people even if they're already getting
大量的阳光照射
a lot of sun exposure,
维生素D3水平仍然很低
still have vitamin D3 levels that are too low.
维生素D3非常重要
And vitamin D3 is very important
大量的心血管免疫
for a huge number of cardiovascular, immune,
新陈代谢和健康的其他方面
metabolic and other aspects of health.
再一次  如果你去www.athleticgreens.com/huberman
So once again, if you go to www.athleticgreens.com/huberman,
你会得到五个旅行包
you'll get the five travel packs
以及一年的维生素D3+K2供应
and a year supply of vitamin D3+K2.
今天是我们系列播客的第三集
Today is the third episode in our series of episodes
关于身体和运动技能的表现
about physical and athletic skill performance
和技能学习
and skill learning in general.
今天我们要讲的是
And today we're going to talk about the science of tools
减脂的科学
for fat loss.
减脂是很重要的
And fat loss is something
这引起了很多人的兴趣
that interests a large number of people.
很多人想减肥
Many people want to lose fat,
很多运动员都需要减肥
many people are athletes who need to lose fat.
一般来说  我们知道身体脂肪百分比太高
And in general, we know that having body fat percentages
对我们是不健康的
that are too high is unhealthy for us.
大多数人都在努力减肥
And most people struggle to lose fat.
大多数人都在努力减肥
Most people struggled to lose weight generally,
但大多数人尤其难以减掉身体脂肪
but most people especially struggled to lose body fat
也就是我们所说的脂肪组织
or what we call adipose tissue.
那么  这是互联网上的一个大话题
Now, this is a huge topic on the internet.
有很多争议
There's a lot of controversy.
今天  我们将讨论一些事情
Today, we're going to talk about some things
与减肥有关
related to fat loss,
这对减肥很有帮助
and that are powerful for fat loss
我猜你们大多数人以前都没听说过
that I'm guessing most of you have never heard about before.
你可能听说过其中一些
You may have heard about a few of them,
但我猜你还没听说过全部
but I'm guessing you haven't heard about all of them.
这一集将会有很多基于科学的工具
This episode is going to be rich with science-based tools
都是从各个方面收集的
that are gleaned from a variety of aspects
的文献
of the literature,
包括冷的使用
including the use of cold,
包括棕色脂肪
including brown fat,
包括一种叫米色脂肪的东西
including something called beige fat.
我们要讲一个叫NEAT的东西
We're going to talk about something called NEAT.
我们会讲到减肥的各个方面
We're going to talk about all sorts of aspects of fat loss
由你的神经系统控制
that are governed by your nervous system.
我认为这是一个重要的差距
And this is I think an important gap
现在社会中  关于减肥的讨论中很多都没有讨论到这个
that's missing in the discussion about fat loss.
你在其他地方可能听到很多信息
You can hear a lot of information out there
胰岛素的作用
about the role of things like insulin
还有各种饮食  比如生酮饮食
and various diets like ketogenic diets
或素食饮食或地中海饮食
or vegan diets or Mediterranean diets.
其中一些确实很棒很有用
And there's some great stuff out there,
但也有一些非常可怕的信息
and there's some really terrible information out there,
有很多争议
and there's a lot of controversy.
我们做了几集播客
We did a number of episodes talking
关于激素在新陈代谢中的作用
about the role of hormones on metabolism
以及食物对情绪和健康的作用
and the role of food on mood and wellbeing.
如果你对这些话题感兴趣
So if you're interested in those topics,
请查看一下
please check them out.
今天我要讲一点荷尔蒙
I will touch a little bit on hormones today.
像胰岛素和瘦素  只是一点点
Things like insulin and leptin, just a little bit.
但今天的播客主要是
But today's episode is mainly going to be focused on,
神经系统  神经元
how the nervous system, neurons,
它们与一些细胞合作
and some of the cells they collaborate with,
比如胶质瘤和巨噬细胞
like glioma and macrophages,
它们是如何促进或能够促进加速减肥的
how those encourage or can encourage accelerated fat loss.
因为事实证明他们可以
Because it turns out they can.
记住你的神经系统包括你的大脑
Remember your nervous system which includes your brain
还有你的脊髓
and your spinal cord and all the connections
以及与身体的器官的所有连接
that they make with the organs of the body,
支配一切
governs everything.
它是免疫系统的开关
It's the on switch and the off switch for immune system.
这是开开关和关开关
It's the on switch and the off switch.
这也有助于脂肪燃烧
It turns out also for fat burning.
还有神经系统和大脑的作用
And so the nervous system and the role of the brain
而其他神经元则被大大忽视了
and other neurons has been vastly overlooked
在减肥的讨论中
in the discussion about losing fat.
那么  如果我忽略了其中的一点
Now, I would be remiss
可能会被很多人喷
and I'd probably come under a pretty considerable attack,
那就是
if I didn't just acknowledge upfront
代谢科学的核心真理
a core truth of metabolic science
坦白说  神经科学也是如此
and also of neuroscience, frankly,
也就是摄入的卡路里和消耗的卡路里
which is that calories in versus calories out,
也就是说你摄入了多少卡路里
meaning how many calories you ingest,
以及你燃烧了多少卡路里
versus how many calories you burn
就是最基本和最重要的公式
is the fundamental and most important formula
在减肥这一行
in this business of fat loss
以及体重管理
and weight management in general.
这是无法回避的事实
There's simply no way around the fact
如果你摄入的卡路里远远超过你消耗的卡路里
that if you ingest far more calories than you burn,
你可能会发胖
you're likely to gain weight.
增重的很大一部分
And a good portion of that weight
很可能是脂肪组织的脂肪
is likely to be adipose tissue fat.
如果你摄入更少的卡路里
It's also true that if you ingest fewer calories
比消耗的更少
than you burn,
你就能减肥
that you will lose weight,
这是很大一部分
and that a significant portion
其中一部分来自身体脂肪
of that will come from body fat.
什么部分?
What portion?
这取决于很多因素
Depends on a number of factors.
但这个简单的公式很重要
But that simple formula is important.
在之前的一集播客里  我提到了并发症
On a previous episode, I mentioned the complications
卡路里就是卡路里
with the statements of a calorie is a calorie.
确实有证据  比如
And indeed there is evidence from for instance
Robert Lustig  他是儿科内分泌学家
Robert Lustig, who's a pediatric endocrinologist
加州大学旧金山分校的教授
at UC San Francisco has talked
关于深度加工食品如何改变这种
about how highly processed foods change the way
我们利用食物的方式
that we utilize food,
会导致更高的肥胖发病率
and can lead to higher incidences of obesity
以及其他的代谢综合症
and other metabolic syndromes that go against the idea
都与“一卡路里就是一卡路里  仅此而已”这个观点相悖
that a calorie is a calorie and that's it.
所以卡路里是能量单位
So a calorie is a calorie as a unit of energy,
我们需要接受并承认这些卡路里
and we need to accept and acknowledge this calories in,
也就是摄入的卡路里和燃烧的卡路里
meaning calories ingested versus calories burned formula.
但是卡路里燃烧部分受到很大影响
But the calories burn portion is strongly influenced
受到你可以控制的很多事情
by a number of things that you can control
这可以大大加速
that can greatly accelerate
或者增加脂肪组织的数量
or increase the amount of adipose tissue
或者脂肪组织的比例
or the proportion of adipose tissue
通过运动消耗和摄入之中的卡路里
that you burn in response to exercise and food.
所以你的荷尔蒙很重要
So your hormones are important.
你的产热的环境
Your thermogenic milieu,
意思是你的身体有多热或多冷?
meaning how warm or how cold your body is?
你使它多么寒冷
How cold you make it,
你让它有多暖和?
how warm you make it?
还有你的新陈代谢水平
But also your level of metabolism.
你的甲状腺激素水平
Your levels of thyroid hormone
这是很少有人讨论的话题
and something that's hardly ever discussed,
但却得到了科学文献的有力支持
but is well supported by the scientific literature,
神经支配多少?
how much innervation?
意味着有多少连通性
Meaning how much connectivity there is,
在你的神经系统和脂肪之间
between your nervous system and fat.
今天  我们来谈谈这个事实
Today, we're going to talk about the fact
你身体的各种脂肪
that your body fat of various kinds,
身体脂肪有好几种
and there are several kinds of body fat
实际上是由神经元支配的
are actually innervated by neurons.
神经元与你的身体脂肪相连
Neurons connect to your body fat
可以改变
and can change the probability
身体脂肪是否会被燃烧的概率
that that body fat will be burned or not.
所以你的神经系统是这个过程的主控制器
So your nervous system is the master controller of this process,
它在卡路里输出中发挥着重要作用
and it plays a strong role in the calories out,
燃烧的卡路里成分
the calories burned component.
和往常一样  我们将讨论一些科学知识
So as usual, we're going to discuss a little bit of science.
我保证不会深入讲解脂解
I promise I won't go too deep into lipolysis
以及所有与脂肪氧化有关的事情
and all sorts of things related to fat oxidation.
我们将分解这个过程
We're going to break down that process
分成两个重要步骤
into two important steps.
如果你能理解这两个重要的步骤
And if you can understand those two important steps
剩下的工具就很简单了
then the rest of the tools will be very straightforward
去理解和管理
to understand and manage.
我相信今天你会
And I do believe that today you will walk away
了解到有许多新的工具  你可以合并
with many new tools that you could incorporate
加入任何一种减肥方案
into any kind of fat loss regimen
这将大大加快这一进程
that will greatly accelerate that process,
因为它是建立在高质量的同行评议科学基础上的
because it's grounded in quality peer-reviewed science.
整个播客,
Throughout the episode,
我要讲一些行为工具
I'm going to talk about some behavioral tools.
事实上  我主要讲的是行为工具
In fact, I'll mostly talk about behavioral tools.
我还会讲到化合物  补充剂
I will also talk about compound, supplements.
你们很多人都喜欢补充剂
Many of you are into supplements.
有些人不喜欢  这没关系
Some of you aren't, and that's fine.
对于那些喜欢补充剂的人
For those of you that are into supplements,
这是补充剂讨论中的一个重要问题
an important issue in a discussion about supplements
对于减脂或其他的目的
for fat loss or otherwise is going to be the quality
就是这些补品质量的准确性
of those supplements and the accuracy
那些补品瓶和药片里有什么
about what's in those supplement bottles and tablets,
等等
et cetera.
我通常会在播客的最后提到这一点
I usually mention this at the end of the podcast,
但在这个播客中  我们和索恩合作  T-H-O-R-N-E
but this podcast we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.
因为我们认为索恩
Because Thorne we believe has the highest levels
在化合物质量方面的严格程度的级别最高
of stringency in terms of the quality of the compounds
以及这些化合物的含量
in their supplements and the amounts of those compounds.
如果你想看我服用的补品
If you want to see the supplements I take,
你可以登录www.thorne.com/u/huberman
you can go to www.thorne.com/u/huberman.
你可以看到我服用的补品
You can see the supplements that I take,
还可以打八折
that will also allow you to get 20% off
任何一种我吃的补充剂
any of those supplements,
以及索恩做的其他补品  都打八折
or 20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
索恩与梅奥诊所合作
Thorne has partnered with the Mayo Clinic
和所有主要的运动队
and all the major sports teams.
所以他们的严格是有很强的基础的
So there's a very strong basis for their stringency.
同样  你不需要服用补充剂
Again, you don't need to use supplements.
我当然不鼓励任何人服用补充剂
I'm certainly not encouraging anyone to use supplements
如果这不是你的菜
if that's not your thing,
但如果你要服用补充剂
but if you're going to use supplements,
确保你的补充剂来源
make sure that your supplement source
是一种非常高的品质
is one a very high quality.
说到这里  我想开始正题
With that said, I want to get started
我们来谈谈减肥的各种方法
and talk about the various tools for fat loss
以及神经科学   神经元是如何控制脂肪减少的
and how neuroscience, neurons control fat loss.
在这之前
Before I do that,
我想要正确地设置上下文
I want to set the context correctly
并从之前的播客中提取一些关键信息
and extract some of the key takeaways from previous episodes,
因为如果你的健康基础
because if your foundation of health
和荷尔蒙的基础
and your foundation of hormones
你的新陈代谢基础不正常
and your foundation of metabolism isn't right,
想要得最好的减脂效果是非常困难的
it's going to be very hard to get the most
任何形式的运动或减脂计划
out of any kind of exercise or fat loss protocol.
在之前的播客中  我谈到了所有的科学
In previous episodes, I talked all about the science
以及具体工具方法的细节
and the details going into particular protocols.
我们现在没时间了
We don't have time to do that now,
我想开始新的内容
and I want to get to the new material.
然而  有几个点
However, there are a couple bins,
有几件事你要确定
a couple items that you should make sure
你要正确
you're getting correctly.
如果你在这些方面不完美  不要担心
And if you're not perfect about these, don't worry about it,
大多数人都不是完美的
most people are not perfect about them,
我自己当然也不是完美的
I'm certainly not perfect about them.
但我们都应该努力获得高质量
But we should all be striving to get quality
和充足的睡眠
and sufficient sleep.
我做了整整四集关于睡眠的播客
I did four full episodes on sleep
以及如何提高睡眠质量
and how to get better at sleeping
通过光线暴露  温度
through things like light exposure, temperature,
根据你所谓的睡眠类型正确地安排睡眠时间
timing your sleep correctly for your so-called chronotype,
如果你是个夜猫子或早起的人
if you're a night owl or a morning person.
这是头四集或者五集
That's the first four or I think five episodes
HubermanLab播客
of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
好好睡一觉
Get your sleep right,
正确的光照
get your light exposure right,
当你想睡觉时
avoid bright light in your eyes
避免眼睛受到强光照射
at times you wanted to be asleep,
有时你想保持清醒
and get bright light in your eyes
让亮光照进你的眼睛
at times you want to be awake.
所以好好睡一觉
So get your sleep right.
另一种是必需脂肪酸
The other thing is essential fatty acids.
我在“EP11 食物和营养如何控制我们的情绪” 那一集讲过
I talked about this in the food and mood episode,
但我也在讲荷尔蒙的时候说过
but I also talked about it during the hormones episodes.
我们需要脂肪酸
We need fatty acids.
它们对我们健康的许多方面都至关重要
They are vital to so many aspects of our health.
你不需要从补充剂中获得它们
You don't have to get them from supplements.
如果你想也可以吃补剂
You can, if you want to,
但你得从食物中摄取
but you need to get them from your food.
它们是至关重要的
They are essential.
这里它重要是有原因的
There's a reason there's an E the essential part there.
脂肪酸的含量
Of the fatty acids,
有很多种
there are multiple kinds,
但它有抗抑郁的效果
but for the antidepressant effects
能促进好心情的脂肪酸水平
where the levels of fatty acids that will promote good mood
以及健康的新陈代谢
and also healthy metabolism
我们将开始把讲解放到正确的方向
and we'll start to shift the needle in the right direction
关于血液传播等的心血管因素
on bloodborne cardiovascular factors.
关键是要知道摄入EPA的水平
The key thing is to get the levels of EPA
每天摄入量超过1000毫克
that you ingest above 1000 milligrams per day.
这并不意味着只摄入1000毫克
So that doesn't mean just taking a thousand milligrams
或者说是鱼油或磷虾油
or more of say fish oil or krill oil
或者任何你喜欢的来源
or whatever your preferred source is.
这意味着要摄入超过1000毫克的EPA
It means getting above a thousand milligrams of EPA
这可能需要你摄入更多的必需脂肪酸
which may require that you ingest more essential fatty acids
而不仅仅是每天1000毫克
than just a thousand milligrams per day.
这当然可以通过食物来源来实现
That of course can be done through food sources,
比如脂肪多的鱼
things like fatty fish,
或者如果你不喜欢吃鱼
or if you're not into eating fish,
用草养的优质肉类就可以做到
you've quality meats that are grass raised can do that.
必需脂肪酸还有其他来源
There are other sources of essential fatty acids,
当然还有植物来源
of course also from plant sources.
去上网搜搜
So look, those up online.
真的很容易找到
It's really easy to find.
但研究和文献表明
But the research and the literature shows
你最好摄入量超过1000毫克
that you want to get above a thousand milligrams
EPA
of EPA per day,
因为那是你最能支持新陈代谢的量
because that's when you can best support your metabolism
为减肥做好准备
and position yourself for good fat loss.
对于那些有进食问题的人来说
As well for people who have cravings issues,
他们总是想吃甜食
they crave sweets all the time,
我在EP16那一集讲过这个
I talked about this in the gut-brain episode
荷尔蒙和食物
and hormones and food.
你的肠道里有神经元在渴望
That you have neurons in your gut that are craving,
他们在寻找必需脂肪酸
they're seeking essential fatty acids
他们渴望从你的食物中寻找氨基酸
and they're craving and seeking amino acids from your food.
这些并不是他们渴望的补品
Now, these are not supplements that they crave per se,
他们渴望这些东西
they're craving those things
因为那是你的身体和大脑所需要的
because that's what your body needs and your brain needs.
但这些神经元也会对糖做出反应
But those same neurons will respond to sugars.
很多人都想吃糖
And so many people who are craving sugar
能通过给予神经元来满足对糖的渴望
can satisfy that sugar craving by giving the neurons
也就是他们真正想要的
so to speak what they actually want,
也就是氨基酸和必需脂肪酸
which are amino acids and essential fatty acids.
包括EPA  还有谷氨酰胺
That includes EPA, but also things like glutamine
以及能真正减少对糖的渴望的氨基酸
and amino acid that can really reduce sugar cravings
如果你拿一茶匙
if you take a teaspoon of that,
或者一天吃几次一汤匙
or even a tablespoon of that a few times a day.
你得慢慢来
You have to ease into that a little bit,
因为有些人可能会有一点肠胃不适
because some people can get a little bit of GI distress
因为谷氨酰胺过多
from too much glutamine.
但谷氨酰胺也被证明可以
But glutamine has also been shown to improve symptoms
改善肠漏症状
of leaky gut.
它是一种功能强大的氨基酸
It's a powerful amino acid.
是的  你也可以从食物中获得
And yes, you can also get it from food.
白软干酪之类的东西谷氨酰胺含量很高  等等
Things like cottage cheese are high in glutamine, et cetera.
最后  你无法真正得到好的减脂效果
And then finally you can't really position yourself
如果你的碘水平很高的话
to have a strong metabolism if your iodine levels
碘水平不对
aren't correct,
你的甲状腺也不正常
and your thyroid levels aren't correct.
碘可以过量
You can overdo iodine.
所以你不想这样做
So you don't want to do that.
很多食盐中都加入了碘
A lot of table salt has iodine added to it,
但有些人需要加碘
but some people need to add iodine,
通过摄入海带等东西
by ingesting things like kelp, et cetera..
但这是支持甲状腺系统最好的方法之一
But one of the best ways to support the thyroid system
和新陈代谢
and metabolism in general,
确保你摄入了足够的硒
is to make sure you're getting enough selenium.
有时也叫硒
Sometimes called selenium each day.
最简单的方法就是消化
Simple way to do that is to ingest
硒含量最高的食物
the highest concentration of selenium food
也就’是巴西坚果
that I'm aware of, which is Brazil nuts,
每天吃一到三颗
one or two or three of those per day.
你会有足够的硒
You'll have more than enough selenium
以满足甲状腺的需要
to meet the thyroid needs.
你不想硒含量太高
You don't want your selenium to be too high,
你不希望饮食中任何东西的含量都太高
you don't want a diet too high in anything.
所以  睡眠  充足的epa
So again, sleep, sufficient EPAs,
谷氨酰胺如果你有肠漏的问题
glutamine if you have issues with leaky gut
或者对糖的渴望会有帮助
or sugar cravings can really help.
获取肠道微生物群  对吧?
Get your gut microbiome, right?
我可能没说这一点
I may have missed saying that,
但是让你的肠道微生物群保持正确
but get your gut microbiome right.
这并不一定意味着
That does not necessarily mean
你需要摄入益生菌
you need to ingest probiotics.
你可以  如果你想
You can, if you want to,
但你也可以简单地每天吃
but you can also just simply ingest a serving
一到两份发酵食品
or two of fermented foods per day,
这可以很好地评估
that can greatly assess.
比如德国泡菜  韩国泡菜
So things like sauerkraut, kimchi,
每种文化都有不同的来源
every culture has a different source
或发酵食品的来源
or sources of fermented foods,
它们真的可以帮助肠道微生物群
those can really help the gut microbiome,
然后确保你的甲状腺激素
and then make sure that your thyroid hormone
是通过摄入
is supported through the ingestion
足够的碘来支持 但不要太多
of sufficient iodine not too much
以及足够的硒  不要太多
and sufficient selenium, not too much.
好吧?
Okay?
睡眠  EPA  谷氨酰胺  发酵食品
Sleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods,
碘和硒
iodine and selenium.
这些事情都是基础
That sets the basis for how things
比如运动  寒冷和一些化合物
like exercise, cold and some of the compounds
以及我们今天要讲的其他内容
and other things that we're going to talk about today
我想这对你们很多人来说都是全新的
that are I'm guessing going to be truly new to many of you
这真的会增加你平时的消耗因子
that can really increase the burn factor in the equation
摄入的卡路里和消耗的卡路里
of calories in versus calories burned.
好吧?
Okay?
所以  一方面  我们有这个现实的卡路里
So on the one hand we have this reality of calories in,
与卡路里消耗
versus calories burned.
但是  如果我没有提到接下来的研究  那也是我的失职
However, I would also be remiss if I didn't mention
我的同事做了一项不可思议的研究
an incredible study that was done by my colleague,
斯坦福大学的Alia Crum
Alia Crum at Stanford.
她是一名老师
She's a faculty member,
心理学系的教授
professor in the psychology department.
看看信念如何影响
Looking at how belief affects,
光是思考就能影响事情的效果
just thinking can impact the effects of things
比如运动减肥
like exercise on weight loss.
这些都是令人难以置信的结果
These are just incredible results.
他们所做的就是选择实验对象
What they did was they took subjects
负责打扫酒店的酒店服务人员
who were hotel service people that would clean the hotels
然后进来换床单  等等
and come in and change the linens and so forth.
把他们分成两组
Divide them into two groups.
其中一组被告知要四处走动
One group, they were told moving around
做好本职工作
and doing your duties for your job,
符合美国活动指南的标准
meet the standards for US guidelines for activity
还有运动等等
and movement, et cetera.
以及一个关于运动的基本课程
And a basic lecture about how movement
对你有好处等等
is good for you, et cetera.
但主要是他们的日常活动
But mostly just that their daily activities
达到了美国的标准
met the standards for the US.
而另一组则得到了一堆信息
The other group, however, was given a bunch of information
关于他们的运动和日常生活
about how movement and their daily routine
对心血管健康很有好处
was very good for cardiovascular health,
它可能有助于减肥  等等
it could be good for weight loss, et cetera.
然后他们追踪这些受试者
And then they tracked these subjects
在几个星期的时间里
over a period of many weeks.
这项研究的关键信息
The take home message from this study
只是被告知运动对你有好处
was that simply being told that movement is good for you
可以减肥  等等
can lead to weight loss, et cetera.
导致身体脂肪明显减少
Led to significantly more body fat loss,
腰臀比上发生了变化
waist-to-hip ratio changes in the direction
大多数人都想要的效果
that most people would want.
本质上是一种瘦身
But essentially a slimming down, if you will.
以及其他各种积极的影响
And all sorts of other positive effects
比如心血管健康
on things like cardiovascular health.
仅仅靠运动和锻炼的知识
Simply by the knowledge that movement and exercise
可以帮助各种健康标记
can help various health markers.
这很了不起  也很有说服力
So this is remarkable and it speaks
神经系统的力量
to the power of the nervous system
以及信仰控制我们身体各个方面的力量
and the power of belief in governing aspects of our body
以及我们的生理机能
and our physiology that one would otherwise think
我们超出了意识的控制范围
we're outside our conscious control.
那么  当然  你们中任何一个从科学角度思考的人
Now, of course, any of you that think scientifically
如果你看了这个播客
which I imagine if you watch this podcast
或者你们现在都在听这个播客
or listen to this podcast is all of you by now
可能会想,
probably thinking,
也许他们只是搬得更多了
well, maybe they just moved around more,
或者他们经常站着坐着
or maybe they stood up and sat down more,
也许他们做了其他不同的事
maybe they did something else that was different.
确实有很大的可能性
And indeed there's a strong possibility
他们做事情的方式与另一组不同
that they did things differently than the other group,
但是仅仅知道运动对你有好处
but the mere knowledge that exercise is good for you,
这个动作对你有好处
that movement is good for you,
改变了他们的行为和生理反应
shifted their behavior and their physiology
在增强减肥的方向
in the direction of enhanced weight loss,
减肥  等等
fat loss, et cetera.
我们脑子里如何看待一组给定的活动
So how we think about a given set of activities
会影响我们进行这些活动的方式
affects how we perform those activities.
我们如何思考和执行这些活动
And how we think about and perform those activities
真的会对我们的生理机能有影响
has a real effect on our physiology.
所以在硬性规定
So somewhere between the hard and fast rule
也就是控制着脂肪和体重的减少
that governs fat loss and weight loss,
如果你摄入的卡路里比燃烧的多
which is if you ingest more calories than you burn,
你要么保持体重  要么体重增加
you'll either maintain or gain weight.
通常情况下  你会增重
Typically, you'll gain weight,
虽然不总是这样
although not always.
如果你摄入的卡路里和燃烧的一样多
If you ingest about as many calories as you burn,
一般来说  你会保持体重
you'll maintain weight, typically.
如果你摄入的卡路里比燃烧的少
And if you ingest fewer calories than you burn,
通常情况下  你会减肥
typically you'll lose weight.
这就是减肥的法则
That's the kind of rule of fat loss.
然而我们也有这些信念效应
And yet we also have these belief effects which show,
这已经被重复实验了一次又一次
and this has been replicated again and again,
我们如何看待一个过程
that how we think about a process,
不管是我们觉得这是有益的
whether or not we think it's beneficial
能改变我们的生理机能
can change our physiology in ways
以对我们有益的方式
that can be beneficial to us.
介于这两个极端之间
Somewhere in between those two extremes
核心代谢科学
of hardcore metabolic science
以及信念效应
and belief of why a bunch of protocols
在生理学上  以高质量的同行评议科学为基础的 一堆工具方法
that are grounded in quality peer-reviewed science
你可以利用它
and in physiology that you can leverage
来加快脂肪减少的速度
to increase the rates of fat loss.
这就是我们今天要讲的内容
And so that's what we're going to talk about today.
我喜欢这个话题  但不是说
I love this topic and it's not
我痴迷于减肥
that I'm so obsessed with fat loss,
而是我从事的第一个科学项目
but rather the first the project I ever worked on in science
是生热和减脂
was thermogenesis and fat loss.
我本科时加入了一个实验室
I joined a laboratory as an undergraduate,
我的导师喜欢探索新的化合物
and the guy I worked for loved to explore new compounds
以及它们是如何影响生热作用的
and how they impacted thermogenesis.
所以我们研究了MDMA/摇头丸
And so we looked at how things like MDMA/Ecstasy,
抗精神病药物、抗抑郁药物
how antipsychotics, antidepressants,
市场上有各种各样的减肥药
various weight loss drugs that were on the market.
这些是如何影响体温的
How those impacted body temperature
脂肪减少和新陈代谢呢?
and fat loss and metabolism?
我们的研究做得很开心
And we just had so much fun doing it.
所以如果你发现我脸上有笑容
So if you detect a smile on my face,
是因为我想到了那段时光
that's what that's about.
我也学到了很多
And I also learned a lot,
我也开始真正欣赏
and I also came to really appreciate
我们身体的这个组织
that this tissue of our bodies,
脂肪组织和脂肪
adipose tissue and fat,
我们认为这是一种不好的东西
we think of as just this unfortunate thing
就像我们被告知的那样  它是核心能源
that's like we're told it's a core energy source
如果我们进入饥荒  这都是真的  等等
if we ever entered a famine and that's all true, et cetera.
你开始意识到我们体内的细胞
You come to realize that the cells in our body,
它们是我们身体熔炉的燃料
they are there as fuel for the furnace of our body,
这熔炉就是我们的新陈代谢
which is our metabolism.
但还有第三个玩家
And there's a third player.
这才是真正有趣的地方
And that's where it really gets interesting.
神经系统  神经元有机会
That the nervous system, neurons has the opportunity
提高炉子的强度
to turn up the intensity of that furnace.
它有机会增加热量
It has the opportunity to increase the amount of heat
也就是我们所产生的能量
that we produce and therefore the amount of energy
我们燃烧
that we burn.
我也对一件事很感兴趣
And I was also really intrigued by something which is that,
从小到大  我想我们都认识一种人
growing up, I think we all know people
他们吃得很好  身体似乎永远不会增肥
who can eat a tone and never seem to gain any body fat.
或者似乎吃得很少的人
Or people who seem to eat very little
而且似乎很容易发胖
and seem to gain body fat very easily.
我一直对此很感兴趣
And I was always intrigued by that.
事实证明有很多不同的因素
And it turns out there are a number of different factors
与此相关
that relate to that.
但是神经系统是
But the nervous system is the one
我们真正可以控制的东西
that we can really control.
通过行为和我们吃的东西
Both through behaviors and what we eat,
同时也涉及到我们所说的生热作用
but also in terms of this thing that we call thermogenesis.
有一个特别的故事我想讲一下
There was one particular story I want to relate to,
这并不意味着有任何工具方法
that does not suggest any protocol.
事实上  我要阻止你
In fact, I'm going to discourage you
不要去用这个工具方法
from following this protocol.
请不要尝试我将要描述的化合物
Please do not try the compound that I'm about to describe.
这是我们在实验室最喜欢做的事情之一
One of the favorite things that we like to do in that lab
就是找到稀有化合物并测试它们
was to find rare compounds and test them.
那时我正在读关于生热作用的书
And at the time I was reading about thermogenesis
我了解到一种化合物
and I learned about a compound
那是在军械库工厂发现的
that was actually discovered in the armory factories
第二次世界大战
of World War II.
它被发现是因为女性
And it was discovered because women in particular
在这些工厂工作的女性
who were working in these factories
会把刷子浸在化合物里
would take a brush and dip it in a compound
或者应该说是一种涂料
or a paint rather,
然后她们会用模版把数字画出来
and they would then paint the numbers with a stencil
比如炸弹和各种弹药
onto things like bombs and ammunition of various kinds.
结果她们都疯狂地瘦了
And they were losing weight like crazy.
事实证明  她们偶尔会舔一下刷子
It turns out that occasionally they'd lick the brush,
然后她们会返回去画  舔一下可以让刷子笔画更清晰
and then they would go back just to get a sharper point on the brush,
然后她们会在这些不同的子弹上作画
and then they would paint onto these various bullets
导弹等等
and missiles and so forth.
炸弹等等
Bombs and so forth.
她们开始减掉身上所有的脂肪
And they started shedding all their body fat.
她们中的很多人  不好意思  减了很多体重
And many of them losed, excuse me, lost a lot of weight,
体重的很大一部分
a significant portion of their weight
前提在不改变她们正在做的任何事情的情况下
without changing anything else that they were doing,
比如她们吃什么  等等
what they were eating, et cetera.
结果是那个化合物
It turned out that that compound
叫做二硝基酚  DNP
is something called Dinitrophenol, DNP.
多年来  二硝基苯酚  DNP越来越受欢迎
And over the years Dinatrophenol, DNP has gained popularity
在一些利基文化中
in some niche cultures,
主要是健美运动员  甚至模特行业
mainly bodybuilders, athletes even in the modeling industry.
它对任何人来说都是一种可怕的化合物
It is a absolutely terrible compound for anyone to use,
因为如果你的体温变得过高
because it's highly fatal if your body temperature
那会是致命的
goes too high.
体温过高会害死你的
Hyperthermia will kill you.
确实有很多人死于二硝基苯
And indeed many people have died using Dinatrophenol
作为一种减肥药或尝试
as a weight loss drug or attempting
用来做减肥药
to use it as a weight loss drug.
但二硝基苯酚确实说明了一个原理
But Dinitophenol really illustrates a principle
你的新陈代谢包括了
which is that your metabolism includes things
比如甲状腺激素和生长激素等等
like thyroid hormone and growth hormone, et cetera.
但是你的体温
But your body temperature
以及你利用能源的方式
and the way you utilize energy
是由你的神经系统控制的
is controlled by your nervous system.
苯二酚的作用方式是通过改变神经元
And the way Dinatrophenol works is by changing the neurons
以及神经元连接脂肪的方式
and the way that the neurons that connect to fat
改变脂肪燃烧的方式
change the way fat burns up.
所以我们不会说
So we are not going to suggest,
我不是建议你使用二硝基苯酚
I am not suggesting that you use Dinatrophenol.
然而  还有其他事情
However, there are other things
你可以改变这段关系
that you can do that can change the relationship
在这些神经元和身体脂肪之间的关系
between these neurons and the fat of your body
可以加速脂肪的减少
in ways that can powerfully accelerate fat loss.
我不知道为什么我们不经常听到这些事
And I don't know why we don't hear about these things more,
但可能是因为你所看到的
but probably because most of what you see
在互联网上的焦点
out there on the internet focuses
更多关注在你可以吃什么和应该吃什么
more on what you could eat and should eat
或者不应该吃
or shouldn't eat.
它专注于运动养生
It concentrates on exercise regimens
我们也会讲到
which we will also talk about.
但是燃烧因素
But the burn factor,
你的生热环境是
your thermogenic environment is one of the,
在减肥这一行  即便不是最重要
if not the most important factors
也是非常重要的因素
in this business of fat loss.
因为我是一个神经科学家
And since I'm a neuroscientist
这就是我们要讲的
that's what we're going to talk about.
我们来谈谈脂肪的利用
So let's talk about fat utilization.
让我们来谈谈脂肪是如何转化为能量的
Let's talk about how fat is converted into energy
有时也被称为脂肪燃烧
which is sometimes also called fat burning.
我想让你知道的是
What I'd like you to know
这是一个分为两部分的过程
is that this is a two-part process.
好吧?
Okay?
事实上  有许多生化步骤
In reality, there are many biochemical steps.
如果你上网
And if you log onto the internet,
或者你打开一本课本  想要了解
or you open up a textbook and you want to learn about
脂肪的利用
fat utilization,
你们会看到很多化学反应
you're going to see a lot of chemistry.
如果你愿意  我很乐意深入探讨这种化学反应
And I'm happy to go deep into that chemistry if you like.
但我想你们大多数人可能都感兴趣
But I think most of you are probably interested
杠杆点是什么?
in what are the leverage points?
你可以在哪些方面对这个过程施加控制
Where can you exert control over this process in ways
让其有利于你的目标?
that benefit you?
所以我主要讲这些
So I'm going to focus mainly on those.
好吧?
Okay?
这并不是为了让狂热者感到不安
This is not to upset the aficionados
我会加上一些术语  但我们开始吧
and I will put in some nomenclature, but here we go.
这个过程分为两部分
There's two parts to this process.
一是脂肪动员
One, is fat mobilization.
第二个是脂肪的氧化或利用
And the second is fat oxidation or utilization.
好吧?
Okay?
所以身体脂肪首先要做的是
So the first thing that has to happen for body fat
燃烧或使用或减少
to get burned up or used and reduced
它必须动员起来
is that it has to get mobilized.
这个过程叫做脂解
And that's a process called lipolysis,
但我不在乎你知不知道脂解这个名词
but I actually don't care if you know the name lipolysis,
主要是它的意思  就是说把脂肪从这个位置移开
you just have to move that fat out of the position
从它进去的地方
that it's in.
你必须把它从脂肪细胞中取出来
You have to get it out of the fat cells.
脂肪细胞可以在内脏器官周围
Fat cells can be visceral around our visceral organs
也可以是皮下的
or they can be subcutaneous under our skin.
当大多数人想到脂肪的时候
Most people are thinking about subcutaneous fat
他们想到的是皮下脂肪
when they think about fat.
事情是这样的
So here's the deal.
如果你想知道更多细节
And if you want more detail,
很好  我一会儿会讲到
great, I'll touch on that in a bit.
但基本上储存的脂肪有两部分
But basically stored fat has two parts
与我们的讨论是相关的
that are relevant here.
它含有脂肪酸部分
It's got the fatty acid part,
这是你身体可以使用的部分
and that's the part that your body can use.
它连着一种叫甘油的东西
And that's attached to something called glycerol
它们由主干连接
and they're linked by a backbone.
对你们来说  可能已经有太多的化学反应了
So already, probably too much chemistry for both of you.
但你想要的是折断主干
But what you want is you want to break the backbone.
所以如果你能记得调动脂肪
So if you just can remember to mobilize fat,
你得折断
you got to break the backbone
在甘油和这些脂肪酸之间的主干
between glycerol and these fatty acids.
好吧?
Okay?
这是由一种叫做脂肪酶的酶完成的
That's accomplished by an enzyme called lipase,
但如果你想的话  你可以把这些都忘掉
but you can forget all that if you want.
记住  我们只是在努力调动脂肪
Remember, we're just trying to mobilize fat.
第一步是得到这些脂肪酸
So the first step is to get those fatty acids
在血液中移动
moving around in the bloodstream
把它们从脂肪细胞中取出来
to get them out of those fat cells.
然后它们就可以流动并被用作能源
And then they can travel and be used for energy.
第二部分
And that second part,
第一部分是动员
remember first part is mobilization.
第二部分是氧化
The second part is oxidation.
然后是那些脂肪酸
Is then those fatty acids,
这些都是潜在的燃料
those are potential fuel.
它们只是潜在的燃料
They're just potential fuel,
但你还没把脂肪烧掉
but you haven't burned the fat yet,
你只是把它从脂肪细胞中移了出来
you've just moved it out of your fat cells.
它们会进入可以利用它们提供能量的细胞
They're going to go into cells that can use them for energy.
一旦它们进入这些细胞
And once they are inside those cells,
它们还没有被烧毁
they're still not burned up.
你需要氧化它们
You need to oxidize them.
把氧化想做是消耗的部分
Think oxidation is the burnup part.
它们需要被转移到线粒体中
They need to be moved into the mitochondria
然后它们可以转化成ATP转化成能量
and then they can be converted into ATP into energy.
我们再缩小一下
So just to really zoom out again to make sure
我没有漏讲任何一点
I don't lose anybody.
你得调动脂肪
You got to mobilize the fat,
然后你需要氧化脂肪
then you have to oxidize the fat.
换句话说  你必须调动它
In other words, you have to mobilize it,
然后你要把它转化成能量
then you actually have to convert it into energy.
如果你把它调动起来
If you just mobilize it,
你不能把它转化成能量
and you don't convert it into energy,
你不会氧化它
you don't oxidize it,
它可以变成身体脂肪
it can be returned to body fat.
神经系统能做的很多事情
And many of the things that the nervous system can do,
就是增加脂肪的动员
is to increase the mobilization of fat,
还有脂肪的氧化作用
but also the oxidation of fat.
好吧?
Okay?
所以你有两个机会燃烧更多的脂肪
So you have two opportunities to burn more fat,
这两种机会都是
and both of those opportunities are governed
受你的神经系统控制的
by your nervous system.
通过神经元发送小神经
By neurons that literally send little wires
轴突转化成脂肪并释放化学物质
that we call axons into fat and release chemicals
为更多的脂肪提供了刺激
that provide a stimulus for more of that fat
去动员,
to be mobilized,
之后会有更多的脂肪被燃烧
and then later for more of that fat to be burned up.
我们可以深入研究这个问题
So we could go really deep on this,
但我不会讲得更深入
but I'm not going to go much deeper than that,
因为这不是生物化学
because this isn't a biochemistry
脂肪酸代谢讲座
of fatty acid metabolism lecture.
这是关于如何利用你的神经系统燃烧脂肪
This is about how to burn fat using your nervous system.
但要记住  这里有一个动员
But remember, there's a mobilization step,
然后是氧化反应
and then there's an oxidation step.
我想你们中的任何人
I think anyone of you,
你们所有人都应该能够内化它
all of you should be able to internalize that.
动员然后氧化
Mobilize then oxidize.
好吧?
Okay?
动员然后氧化
Mobilize then oxidize.
那么这些连接脂肪的神经元在做什么呢?
So what are these neurons that connect a fat doing?
它们到底释放了什么?
What are they releasing exactly?
它们是如何增加脂肪流动的呢?
How do they actually increase fat mobilization?
它们是如何增加脂肪氧化的?
And how do they increase fat oxidation?
燃烧脂肪
Burning of fat.
它们会释放一些东西
Well, there are a couple of things that they release
这鼓励了这个过程
that encourage that process.
你需要知道的最主要的是肾上腺素
And the main one that you need to know about is epinephrine
这些脂肪酸转化成ATP的过程
The conversion of these fatty acids into ATP
在细胞的线粒体中  肾上腺素占优势
in the mitochondria of cells is favored by adrenaline.
好吧?
Okay?
肾上腺素的释放有两个来源
And adrenaline is released from two sources.
肾上腺素从肾上腺释放出来
Adrenaline is released from the adrenal glands,
它在我们的肾脏和下背部的顶部
which set a top our kidneys and our lower back.
它也从另一个地方释放
And it's also released
来自所谓的交感神经系统
from the so-called sympathetic nervous system.
虽然这个名字有点用词不当
Although that name is a bit of a misnomer,
因为这和同情无关
because it has nothing to do with sympathy,
它和刺激警觉性有关
has to do with stimulating alertness
以及对身体动作有促进作用
and promoting action of the body.
文献里有个很大的错误
There's a big mistake in the literature
那些知道的人终于纠正了这一点
that is finally being corrected among those who know.
文献中的错误是肾上腺
The mistake in the literature is that the adrenal glands
肾上腺素的释放是促使脂肪减少的原因
and the release of adrenaline is what stimulates fat loss
和脂肪氧化
and fat oxidation.
事实上  很长一段时间以来  人们都在思考这个问题
In fact, it was thought for a long time
肾上腺素在你体内游走
that adrenaline swimming around in your body
当你禁食的时候
of when you're fasted,
因为禁食会增加肾上腺素
because fasting can increase adrenaline
或者当你在进行剧烈运动的时候
or when you're engaging in intense exercise
或者当你有压力的时候会促进脂肪氧化
or when you're stressed is going to promote fat oxidation.
事实并非如此
That's actually not the case.
刺激脂肪氧化的肾上腺素
The adrenaline that stimulates fat oxidation,
让脂肪燃烧的肾上腺素
the burning of fat is coming from neurons
实际上从脂肪相连接的神经元中释放
that actually connect to the fat,
而不是像肾上腺素这样的荷尔蒙
not hormones like adrenaline that are swimming around
在你的系统里游走
in your system.
这是一个局部过程
It's a local process.
这很重要  因为这意味着
And this is very important because it means that,
你做什么  具体的动作模式
what you do, the specific patterns of movements
以及你所创造的特定环境
and the specific environment you create
可以刺激这些特定的神经元来激活脂肪
that can stimulate these particular neurons to activate fat,
去释放脂肪
meaning to release fat,
调动它  然后消耗它
to mobilize it and then to burn it,
这会成为你可以使用的有力的关键
is going to be a powerful lever that you can use
以增加脂肪的减少
in order to increase fat loss.
到目前为止我们说了什么?
So what have we said so far?
我们说过  你必须动员起来  你必须燃烧脂肪
We've said that you've got to mobilize and you got to burn fat
你的神经系统控制着这个过程
and that your nervous system is in control of that process.
这不仅仅是卡路里亏损的问题
It's not just about calorie deficit.
好了  我们来谈谈如何激活
Okay, so let's talk about how to activate
神经系统以促进
the nervous system in ways that it promotes
更多的激素释放、运动、动员脂肪
more liberation, movement, mobilization of fat
和更多的脂肪氧化
and more oxidation of fat.
这是刺激肾上腺素最有效的方法之一
So one of the most powerful ways to stimulate epinephrin
也叫肾上腺素
which is also called adrenaline from these neurons
和神经元脂肪的连接有关  从而刺激
that connect to fat and to thereby stimulate
更多的脂肪动员和氧化  这种方法就是通过“动”
more fat mobilization and oxidation is through movement.
但我说的不是锻炼
But I'm not talking about exercise.
我所指的这种运动
The type of movement that I'm referring to,
是非常微妙的
is extremely subtle.
你们中的一些人可能对这种运动很熟悉
And some of you may be familiar with this type of movement,
但我猜你可能不太熟悉
but I'm guessing you're probably not familiar
我要告诉你的事
with what I'm about to tell you,
颤抖或颤抖是一种强烈的刺激
which is that shiver or shivering is a strong stimulus
为了将肾上腺素释放成脂肪
for the release of adrenaline epinephrin into fat
以及脂肪氧化和动员的增加
and the increase in fat oxidation and mobilization.
但颤抖不仅仅是由寒冷引起的
But shiver is not just induced by cold,
还有其他微妙的运动形式
and there are other subtle forms of movement
这能极大地促进脂肪代谢和脂肪流失
that can greatly increase fat metabolism and fat loss.
在20世纪60年代和70年代的英格兰有一个团体
There was a group in England during the 1960s and 70s
发现了微妙的运动形式的途径
that discovered a pathway by which subtle forms of movement
可大大增加脂肪的流失
can greatly increase fat loss.
这是罗思韦尔和斯托克的研究作品
This is the work of Rothwell and Stock.
它在生热文献中很有名
It's very famous in the thermogenesis literature.
我很早就知道
And I learned about this early on,
当我还是本科生的时候  我问
when I was an undergraduate and I asked,
他们是怎么发现的?
how did they come across this?
故事是这样的
And here's how the story goes.
他们意识到有些人吃得过多
They were aware that some people overeat
但依然不会发胖
and yet don't put on weight.
有些人甚至吃多了一点点
Other people overeat even just a little bit
它们似乎会积聚额外的脂肪组织
and they seem to accumulate extra adipose tissue.
这比所有其他的讨论都要早得多
Now, this is long before all the discussions
比微生物群和激素因素等早得多
about microbiome and hormone factors, you know
那是很久以前
it was long before many of the hormone factors
甚至在发现胰岛素之前
besides insulin had even been discovered.
他们做的是检查那些吃得过多
What they did was they examined people who overate
并且体重没有增加的人
and did not gain weight.
他们观察到这些人
And what they observed was that those people engaged
在一天中有很多微妙的动作
in lots of subtle movement throughout the day.
换句话说  他们坐立不安
In other words, they were fidgeters.
他们就是这么报告的
And that's what they call them.
我不会用英式口音说“坐立不安”
I'm not going to do the British accent version of fidgeters.
但罗斯和斯托克是英国人
But Roth and Stock were British.
他们发现吃得很多
What they found were people that overeat
并且没有因此增加体重的人
but don't gain weight as a consequence.
事实上  很多人体内脂肪含量很低
And in fact, many people who had low levels of body fat
有很多静息性震颤
had a lot of resting tremor,
不是帕金森氏症
not of the Parkinsonian type,
但他们坐着的时候会弹跳膝盖
but they would bounce their knee while they were sitting,
当他们交谈时
when they would talk,
它们会进行非常有角度的运动
they would engage in very angular movements,
他们有点像触电一样
they were sort of electric.
事实上  在科学领域
In fact, now in science,
我一边讨论这部文献
I was chuckling about this as I was diving back
一边暗自发笑的原因是
into this literature,
因为前几天我听了一场精彩的演讲
because the other day I heard a wonderful lecture
和我的一个同事谈了一个完全不同的话题
on a totally different topic from a colleague of mine
我们都崇拜他
and we all adore him.
他在欧洲
He's over in Europe
他是一位非常成功的科学家
and he's this tremendously successful scientist.
所以我们喜欢取笑他
So we like to poke fun at him.
他的每一个动作都充满了电
And every one of his movements is incredibly electric
富含断点
and staccato.
他很瘦  但吃起来像匹马
And he's rail thin and he eats like a horse.
所以他这个人就是验证了这个发现
And so it fits very well into the discovery
罗斯威尔和斯托克的发现
of Rothwell and Stock who discovered
那些坐立不安的人  抖腿的人
that fidgeters people that bounce their knee,
在听别人说话的时候
people that have a head bob while they're listening,
经常点头的人
people that nod a lot,
那些整天站一会儿坐一会儿的人
people that stand up and sit down a lot throughout the day,
有这种生活速度的人
and people that pace burn anywhere from 800
比对照组多消耗800-2500卡路里
to 2,500 calories more than the control group
在他们观察的实验中
in the experiments that they looked at.
事实上  这是一个现代的视角
And indeed, there's been a modern look into all this,
这些数字证实了
and these numbers check out
只是四处走动
that simply moving around a lot,
即使这些是微妙的动作
even if those are subtle movements,
会大大增加你消耗的能量
greatly increases the amount of energy that you burn.
吃的很多的人
And people who overeat,
能吃到第二个或第三个甜甜圈的人
the people who can have the second or the third doughnut
经常吃甜甜圈  体重似乎也没有那样子增加
or doughnuts at all and don't seem to put on weight to the same degree,
他们是即使坐着也会到处动的人
they are people that move around a lot even when seated.
他们是经常活动四肢
They're are people that will often move their limbs
非常快的人
very quickly as well.
甚至有研究探索了其他东西
There even have been studies that have explored other things
这与细微动作有关
that correlate with fidgeters.
一节课结束时  坐立不安的人会很快站起来
Fidgeters stand up very quickly at the end of a lecture
或者他们开始很快地收集东西
or they start to gather their things very quickly,
而不坐立不安的人则不然
whereas non fidgeters don't.
所以像我的斗牛犬科斯特洛这样的狗  绝对不会坐立不安
So dogs like my bulldog Costello, definitely not a fidgeter.
每一个动作都非常缓慢和从容
Every movement is incredibly slow and deliberate.
坐下来是一个漫长的过程
Sitting down as a process,
如果你让他坐下  然后他好像在做慢动作
if you ask him to sit down and sort of a slow motion.
你叫他起来
You ask him to get up
他看着你  叹了口气  站了起来
and he kind of looks at you sighs and stands up.
坐立不安的人正好相反  对吧?
The fidgeter is the opposite of that, right?
你说  你怎么样?
You say, how are you doing?
他们说,好
They go, great.
所以有时他们的讲话速度也会加快
So even sometimes their speech will be accelerated
虽然不总是正确的
although not always.
但是断点的动作  细微动作等等
But staccato movements, fidgeting, et cetera.
在2015年和2017年
And in 2015, and again in 2017,
已经有研究对此进行了探索
there've been studies that have explored this,
使用一些现代代谢追踪
using some modern metabolic tracking
事实上  仅仅是移动了很多
and indeed simply moving a lot,
当坐立不安的人  摇晃膝盖
being a fidgeter, bouncing your knee,
站起来  踱步几次
standing up and pacing several times
或者一天中多次
or many times throughout the day
减少了大量的脂肪和体重
led to considerable amounts of fat loss and weight loss
而且前提是人们摄入了等量的食物
when people were ingesting the same amount of food,
如果他们吃多了  他们能够补偿
if they overate, they were able to compensate
然后把食物热量消耗掉
and burn off that food.
如果他们想减肥
And if they were trying to lose weight
他们采用了细微动作的方法
and they incorporated this fidgeting protocol
故意坐立不安
of deliberately trying to fidget more
在白天四处活动
and move around during the day,
踱步  快点站起来
pace, stand up more quickly,
多坐下来
sit down more often,
更经常地坐下来和站起来
sit down and stand up more often rather.
他们发现他们的减重大大增加了
They found that they greatly increased their weight loss
20%到30%的增长
anywhere from 20 to 30% increases.
在某些情况下  总有那么几个人
And in some cases, you know, there always those few people
消耗得更多的人
who burned a lot more.
它似乎对一种人最有效
It seems to work best in people
就是那些已经稍微超重了
who are already slightly overweight.
所以对于超重的人来说
So for people that are overweight,
不喜欢运动的人
who are kind of averse to exercise,
细微动作可能是一个很好的切入点
fidgeting might actually be a good entry point.
800到2500卡路里是相当可观的
And 800 to 2,500 calories is a considerable amount
你可以认真考虑一下
of calories when you really think about it.
我为什么要告诉你这些?
Now, why am I telling you this?
显然有一个工具可以从这里提取出来
Well, there's clearly a tool to export from this,
那就是你可以增加卡路里的燃烧量
which is that you can increase the amount of calories burned
不需要进行额外的长距离跑步
without having to go on additional long runs.
我确实希望人们能定期锻炼
I do hope that people are exercising regularly
因为它对大脑的其他方面
because it's so important for other aspects of brain
对身体健康非常重要
and body health.
但无论如何  我们的时间都是有限的
But nonetheless, we are all time limited
我们并不是所有人都准备好接受锻炼
and we are not all so ready to embrace exercise.
我有一个家庭成员  他被慢慢地哄着
I have a family member who has been slowly coaxed
开始锻炼了
into exercise,
但如果我告诉她  比如说
but if I were to tell her, for instance,
你得多动动  细微动作  她可能会同意的
you need to fidget more, she'd probably go for it.
所以这是增加卡路里消耗的有效方法
So this is a powerful way to increase the calories that are burned.
那么  这太好了
Now, that's great.
你可以考虑一下这个工具方法
And you can think about the protocols.
但我想嵌套那个工具方法
But I want to nest that protocol
与我之前说的联系起来
in what I said before,
也就是   脂肪是由这些神经元控制的
which is that, fat is controlled by these neurons
以及它们释放的肾上腺素
and the epinephrin they release.
你可能会说  这些微小的动作
You might say, well, how could these little micro movements
导致这么多卡路里的燃烧?
lead to so much caloric burn?
这才是真正有趣的地方
And that's where it really gets interesting.
罗思韦尔  斯托克和其他与他们合作的人
Rothwell and Stock and others that they worked with,
后来发现  这些小小的烦躁动作
subsequently found that these little fidgety movements,
我们肌肉组织某些方面的参与
the engagement of certain aspects of our musculature
这和锻炼一点都不像
that are nothing like exercise.
不是那些协调或有节奏的大型的身体动作
It's not these large coordinated or rhythmic body movements,
而是非常微妙的一点点不安的动作
but rather subtle little bits of fidgety movement.
这里我做了很多不安的动作作为例子
And here I am doing a lot of fidgety movement as an example,
敲笔之类的
tapping the pen, this kind of thing.
我可能是班里大多数时候的那个孩子
I was probably that kid in class most of the time.
我想  我尽量不去激怒别人
And I was like, I try not to do it to irritate people,
但我绝对是个抖腿的人
but I was definitely a knee bouncer.
我不是特别瘦
I'm not particularly lean or not.
但我绝对是…
But I was definitely...
这对我来说是很常见的活动
This is a common activity for me.
做这种事的人
People that do that sort of thing,
事实证明  这并不是那种
it turns out that it's not the kind of caloric burn
我们通常认为的热量消耗
that we normally think of,
比如  跑步  举重
of like, oh, you'll running, lifting weights,
游泳  瑜伽  等等
swimming, yoga, et cetera.
我们核心肌肉组织的微妙运动
Those subtle movements of our core musculature,
不只是核心  还有我们所有的四肢
not just the core, but all our limbs
我们的肌肉组织,
and our musculature,
那些低水平的运动
those low level movements,
它们会触发这些神经元释放肾上腺素
they trigger epinephrin release from these neurons,
它们刺激脂肪的流动
and they stimulate the mobilization of fat.
然后脂肪以更高的速度被氧化
And then that fat is oxidized at higher rates.
我觉得这很有趣
And I find this fascinating.
我希望更多的人知道它
I wish more people knew about it,
所以我今天才告诉你
which is why I'm telling you about it today.
这和在传统形式的锻炼没有任何关系
This has nothing to do with exercise in the traditional form,
但每天却有800到2500卡路里的热量被消耗
and yet 800 to 2,500 calories per day.
这是相当多的脂肪被氧化了
That's a considerable amount of fat oxidized.
如果你处于卡路里维持模式
If you are in a calorie maintenance mode
或者如果你是低热量的
or if you're sub caloric,
这还会增加额外的脂肪损失
that's going to add to it still additional fat loss.
这方面的数据非常多
The data on this are tremendous.
我会链接一些研究
I'll link to a few studies.
如果你真的对学习感兴趣的话
If you're really interested in learning
关于所谓的NEAT
about what's called neat.
N-E-A-T 也就是  非运动活动生热作用
N-E-A-T which is non-exercise activity thermogenesis.
NEAT
那么工具方法是什么?
So what's the protocol?
细微动作
Fidget.
如果你真的想燃烧卡路里的话
If you're really interested in burning calories
你已经锻炼了
and you already exercise,
你想燃烧更多卡路里
you want to burn more
或者你没有机会锻炼
or you don't have the opportunity to exercise
或者你因为某种原因不愿意锻炼
or you're averse to exercise for whatever reason,
坐立不安  动作  断奏动作
fidgeting, movements, staccato movement,
站起来  四处走动  踱步
standing up, walking around, pacing,
诸如此类的神经活动
all the sort of nervous activities
有的时候会对部分人
that were so critical of other people
有时在我们自己身上非常重要
and sometimes in ourselves
实际上是在动员和氧化
are actually mobilizing and oxidizing
大量脂肪和能量
a lot of fat and a lot of energy.
虽然这可能无法弥补
And while this probably won't compensate
慢性暴饮暴食,
for chronic overeating,
由此产生的热量消耗仍然相当大
the caloric burn from this is considerable,
很可能还能抵消一顿
and very likely can offset a meal
含有过多的卡路里的饭
that had excessive calories
或者是一种吃得太多的稳定状态
or a kind of steady state of eating too much.
它也开始打开各种各样的想法与讨论
And it also starts to open up all sorts of thoughts
你旅行的时候
and discussion about when you travel,
你倾向于吃外面的食物
you tend to eat foods that are kind of outside
正常的人
your normal ones.
我们往往会吃一些对身体不好的食物
We tend to eat foods that aren't so great for us,
我们也更倾向于久坐
we also tend to be a little bit more sedentary
当我们旅行时  我们在飞机上  等等
when we travel we're on the plane, et cetera.
但撇开这些不说
But all of that aside,
只是使用一些低强度的动作
just the use of something like low-level movement.
就像在颤抖
And it's almost like a tremor,
但也有选择短的  小的烦躁的动作
but also these select short, small fidgety movements.
我今天特意做了很多
I'm intentionally doing a lot of these today.
这都是一些例子  你们可以用
So you have examples that you can use
可以选择
to select from if you like.
这些对减肥有很大的影响
These can have a major effect on fat loss
这引出了第二个工具
and it raises a second tool.
如果这些低  意味着这些小的运动
If these low, meaning these small movements
触发肾上腺素的释放
that we engage in trigger epinephrin adrenaline release
来自交感神经系统的神经元
from these neurons of the sympathetic nervous system
刺激脂肪并增加
that innervate fat and increase
脂肪动员和氧化
fat mobilization and oxidation.
那么  我们应该明白为什么
Now, it should make sense why shivering
发抖是最强烈的刺激之一
is one of the strongest stimuli
它可以促进脂肪的减少
that one can incorporate to stimulate fat loss.
发抖几乎总是和寒冷联系在一起
Now, shivering is almost always associated with cold.
我们想到发抖  想到寒冷
We think shivering, we think cold,
因为当我们冷的时候  我们会发抖
because when we get cold, we shiver.
发抖可以通过两种方式减脂
And there are two ways that shivering can increase fat loss.
有几种方法可以使用颤抖
And there are several ways that you can use shivering,
你可以利用颤抖
you can leverage shivering
你可以利用寒冷来加速脂肪的减少
and you can leverage cold to accelerate fat loss.
但你必须正确地去做
But you have to do it correctly.
大多数使用冷的人
And most of the people that are using cold
坦白地说
and frankly suggesting cold
作为一种增加新陈代谢的方法来减肥
as a means to increase metabolism fat loss
提出了完全错误的方案
are suggesting the exact wrong protocol.
事实上  我要推荐的是180度
In fact, the one I'm going to recommend is 180 degrees
与典型工具方法的方向相反
in the opposite direction to the typical protocol
你会听到的
that you'd hear about.
我们来谈谈如何使用寒冷
So let's talk about how to use cold
以及如何利用颤抖作为一种特别强大的刺激
and how to leverage shiver as a particularly strong stimulus
通过动员和氧化来增加脂肪的流失
to increase fat loss through mobilization and oxidation
这些脂肪酸
of these fatty acids.
所以近年来  人们的兴趣越来越浓厚
So in recent years there's been a growing interest
用冷来达到各种目标  比如
in the use of cold for various things like,
提高抗压力能力
improving stress tolerance,
改善新陈代谢  从运动中恢复
improving metabolism, recovery from exercise.
我已经在本播客中讲过很多
I've talked about a number of those things
关于寒冷的用法
and the uses of cold on this podcast.
事实上  之前做过一集关于如何提高运动性能的播客
In fact, did an episode on how to supercharge performance
通过 冷却手掌
through palmer cooling, cooling the palms
或者是脚的底部
in specific ways or the bottoms of the feet.
如果你对此感兴趣
And if you're interested in that,
以及如何提高耐力和力量
and how to improve performance in endurance and strength,
你可以看看那集EP 19
you can check out that episode.
但大多数人都使用冷暴露
But most people out there are using cold exposure
通常是洗冷水澡
typically by taking cold showers
或者进入另一种冷水中
or by getting into cold water of some other kind,
一个湖或一条河或一个冷水浴或冰浴
a lake or a river or a cold bath or an ice bath.
他们这样做的目标可能有好有坏
And they are doing that probably with mixed goals,
这意味着他们都想加快新陈代谢
meaning they both would like to increase their metabolism
燃烧脂肪  同时提高心理弹性
and burn fat, as well as improve mental resilience.
但因为今天我们讨论的是加速减肥
Since today, we're talking about accelerating fat loss
通过使用基于科学的工具
through the use of science-based tools.
我想强调一项发表在《自然》杂志上的研究
I want to emphasize a study that was published in nature
就在几年前
just a couple of years ago,
展示了寒冷如何促进新陈代谢和脂肪减少
showing exactly how cold increases metabolism and fat loss.
好吧?
Okay?
我们有好几种脂肪
So we have several kinds of fat.
实际上有三种
Three kinds in fact.
我们有白色脂肪  白色脂肪组织
We have white fat, white adipose tissue,
我们有棕色脂肪或棕色脂肪组织
and we have brown fat or brown adipose tissue.
第三种是米色脂肪组织
And there's a third kind which is beige adipose tissue.
白色脂肪是我们传统的脂肪类型
White fat is the type that we traditionally
就是我们所熟知的脂肪  皮下脂肪
think of as fat, subcutaneous fat.
而且它并不富含线粒体
And it is not particularly rich in mitochondria.
它是作为一个能量储存场所
It is there as an energy storage site
我们必须调动脂肪
and we have to mobilize the fat out
就像我们之前说过的  把它消耗了
as we talked about before and burn it up elsewhere.
棕色脂肪主要存在于肩胛骨之间
Brown fat largely exists between our shoulder blades
在我们脖子后面  肩胛骨之间
and on the back of our neck, between the scapulae.
它富含线粒体
And it's rich with mitochondria
这就是为什么它被称为棕色脂肪
which is why it's called brown fat.
棕色脂肪有一个特殊的生化级联
And brown fat has a particular biochemical cascade
它可以吸收食物能量
whereby it can take food energy,
它基本上可以消化食物
it can take food, basically,
在细胞内将其分解并转化为能量
break it down and convert it into energy within those cells.
还有一些额外的步骤
And there's some additional steps involved,
但与白色脂肪中的脂肪酸不同
but unlike fatty acids from white fat
白色脂肪要去别的地方游走
which have to travel elsewhere
在线粒体中分解
get broken down in mitochondria
转化成ATP  等等
and convert into ATP, et cetera.
由其他细胞的线粒体使用
Used by the mitochondria rather.
棕色脂肪是产热的
Brown fat is thermogenic.
它实际上可以直接使用能源
It can actually use energy directly.
它跳过了一步  我不想被转移
It skips a step, and I don't want to get diverted
这边不去研究它的生物化学
by going into all the biochemistry of it.
米色脂肪介于两者之间
Beige fat is sort of in between.
是白色脂肪  但可以是棕色脂肪
It's white fat that could be brown fat,
因为它有一些线粒体
because it has some mitochondria in it,
但没有棕色脂肪多
but not as many as brown fat.
暴露在寒冷中有几个作用
Now, cold exposure does several things.
让自己变冷可以让我们
Making ourselves cold can allow us to build up
增强心理弹性  因为任何形式的寒冷
mental resilience because getting into cold of any kind,
不管它是冷冻室
doesn't matter if it's a cryochamber,
就算天冷
doesn't matter if it's a cold day
你忘了带毛衣或皮大衣  也可以
and you forgot your sweater or your parka.
就算是冰浴也没关系
It doesn't matter if it's an ice bath
或者你躺在雪地里
or you're lying down in the snow.
寒冷会导致肾上腺素的释放
Cold causes the release of adrenaline from your adrenals.
它会导致从这些连接脂肪的神经元中
And it causes the release of epinephrin
释放出肾上腺素
from these neurons that connect to fat.
那么  寒冷对新陈代谢和脂肪消耗的巨大影响
Now, the big effects of cold on metabolism
有两种途径
and fat burning are going to be through two routes.
第一  如果你把自己暴露在寒冷中
One, is that if you expose yourself to cold,
你就有机会激活棕色脂肪
you have the opportunity to trigger activation of brown fat
也能将更多的米色脂肪转化为真正的棕色脂肪
as well as to convert more beige fat into true brown fat.
所以你实际上创造了一个更强或更热的熔炉
So you essentially create a stronger or a hotter furnace.
这就是棕色脂肪的概念
That's the way to think about brown fat.
就像火炉一样
It's like a furnace.
这个原则也是如此
And so with this principle
我们从摄入卡路里和燃烧卡路里开始
that we started with a calories in versus calories burned.
你所做的是在增加
What you're doing is you're increasing the amount
消耗的量
of burning,
你增加了能量的燃烧
you're increasing the burn of energy
通过增加你体内的热度
by increasing the intensity of the heat inside you
可以这么说
so to speak.
好吧?
Okay?
我只是打个比方
I'm talking here kind of metaphorically.
怎么做呢?
Now, how can you do that?
好吧  如果你在冷水里
Well, if you get into cold water
或者冰浴  或者寒冷的一天
or an ice bath or a cold day,
你试着保持冷静  抵抗颤抖
and you try and remain calm and resist shivering,
实际上就是破坏
you actually short circuit
增加棕色脂肪生热作用的机制
this mechanism for increasing brown fat thermogenesis.
发表在《自然》杂志上的论文显示
The paper published in nature shows
发抖本身
that it is shivering itself
这会导致棕色脂肪增加消耗
that causes the brown fat to increase your burning,
你的消耗速度和新陈代谢
your burn rate and your metabolism.
它是这样运作的
And it works like this,
当你感到寒冷和颤抖时
when you get into cold and you shiver,
肌肉的低水平运动
the shivering that low level movement of the muscle,
这些小的运动触发了一个分子的释放
those small movements triggers the release of a molecule
琥珀酸
called succinate.
S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E,琥珀酸
S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
琥珀酸会对棕色脂肪起作用
And succinate acts on the brown fat
增加棕色脂肪的生热作用和整体脂肪燃烧
to increase brown fat thermogenesis and fat burning overall.
它实际上增加了身体的热量
It actually increases body heat
通过这个棕色脂肪生热途径
through this brown fat thermogenesis pathway.
随着时间的推移  它还会增加棕色脂肪的数量
And it also over time can increase the amount of brown fat
通过将米色脂肪转化为真正的棕色脂肪
by converting beige fat into true brown fat.
那么  要多少寒冷暴露呢？  多久一次?
Now, how much cold exposure and how often?
这是关键
That's the key.
但在我给出细节之前
But before I give that detail or set of details.
记住  如果你抵抗住颤抖
Remember if you resist the shiver,
你不会得到增加新陈代谢的效果
you are not going to get the increased metabolic effect,
因为你不会得到琥珀酸的释放
because you are not going to get the succinate release.
所以如果你想获得身体的热量
So if you want to get your body heat,
让你的生热水平上升
your thermogenic level to go up,
你需要颤抖
you need to shiver.
现在我们有了NEAT
So now we have the NEAT,
非运动活动生热作用
the non-exercise activity thermogenesis.
正如我之前所描述的低水平活动
So low levels of activity as I described before,
都跟低温没什么关系
which are done away from cold,
也可以冷着做
maybe do them in cold as well.
也会因为寒冷而颤抖
As well as shiver in response to cold.
因此  颤抖本身是有价值的
And so the shiver itself is valuable
可以触发琥珀酸的释放
for triggering the release of succinate.
事实上  琥珀酸正在
In fact, succinate is being evolved now
被不同的药品制造商采用
by various drug manufacturers
作为一种潜在的治疗肥胖症的方法
as a potential treatment for obesity.
虽然它还没有真正进入市场
Although it hasn't really hit the market
没有一个最终形式
in its final form yet.
琥珀酸对棕色脂肪有很好的效果
Succinate is powerful for its effects on brown fat.
那么你一周需要几次
So how many times a week do you need
把自己暴露在寒冷中呢?
to expose yourself to cold?
取决于你想减掉多少脂肪
Will depend on how much fat you're trying to lose,
以及你想要增加多少新陈代谢
and how much you're trying to increase your metabolism.
有一些研究描述了减肥的积极效果
There are studies that describe positive effects on fat loss
把自己暴露在寒冷中
of exposing yourself to cold,
可以用冷水浴  也可以用冰浴
either through cold shower or through ice bath
或其他冷水
or other cold water.
里面不一定要有冰
It doesn't have to actually have ice in it,
只要天气够冷  随时随地
provided it's cold enough for anytime, anywhere,
一周1-5次
excuse me, between one and five times per week.
但事实证明每周只有一次
But it turns out that just one exposure per week
可以是有价值的
can be valuable.
现在的问题是  我们要坚持多久
The question then is how long to get
在那种寒冷的环境中?
into that cold environment?
环境应该有多冷?
And how cold should that environment be?
首先  我们来谈谈
So first let's talk about how long
在那种寒冷的环境中呆多久?
to get into that cold environment?
答案可能
The answer here might be a little bit different
与你想象的有点不同
than you might imagine.
你们大多数人可能会想
Most of you might think,
如果一分钟好  三分钟更好
oh, well if one minute is good, three minutes is better,
那么十分钟肯定比三分钟效果更好  是最好的
and if three minutes is better than 10 minutes is best.
但要记住  我们的目标是让你颤抖
But remember the goal is to get the shiver induced
触发琥珀酸的释放
release of succinate,
琥珀酸会引发棕色脂肪
so that succinate can trigger the brown fat.
事实证明  如果你想引发颤抖
It turns out that if you want to trigger the shiver,
你想做的就是进入寒冷的环境
what you want to do is to get into the cold
然后从寒冷中走出来  通常不要擦干
and then get out of the cold and typically not dry off,
然后回到寒冷的地方  又从寒冷中出来
and then get back into the cold and out of the cold,
那肯定会刺激更多的颤抖
that will definitely stimulate more shivering
而不是直接进入寒冷的环境
than just getting into the cold itself.
我指的不是
So what I'm not referring to,
进入寒冷的环境  比如说冰浴
is getting into the cold environment like an ice bath
等待直到你颤抖  呆在那里发抖
and waiting until you shiver and staying there shivering.
好吧?
Okay?
你也不想体温过低
You also don't want to get hypothermic.
我想澄清一下
And I want to be clear.
你需要得到医生的批准
You want to get approval from your doctor
在你做这些之前
before you do any of this.
当你进入冰冷的水中
When you get into cold water,
有两个因素会决定
there are two factors that will dictate
你是否会颤抖
whether or not you shiver.
可能三个
Probably three,
但我们只讨论主要的两个
but let's just talk about the main two.
一是水有多冷
One, is how cold it is.
那么应该有多冷呢?
So how cold should it be?
看  如果你进入水里  那是非常非常冷的
And look, if you get into water, that's very, very cold.
它可以直接让你的心脏一怔
It can actually shock your heart.
它会让你心脏病发作
It can actually give you a heart attack
如果真的很冷
if it's truly, truly ice cold,
而你却不适应
and you're not adapted to that.
所以请谨慎行事
So proceed with caution, please.
我不是医生  我不想看到任何人受伤
I'm not a physician and I don't want to see anyone get hurt.
冷到让人不舒服
Just cold enough to be uncomfortable
是一个很好的开始
is a good place to start.
对你们中的一些人来说是60华氏度（约16摄氏度）
So for some of you that's going to be 60 degrees,
对你们中的一些人来说是55华氏度  （约13摄氏度）
for some of you that's going to be 55 degrees,
对你们中的一些人来说是30多华氏度（30华氏度约等于-1摄氏度）   好吧?
for some of you it's going to be high thirties, right?
这取决于你对寒冷的适应程度
Depends on how cold adapted you are,
人们对寒冷的耐受性也各不相同
and people vary in terms of how well they tolerate the cold.
所以你要做的就是找到一个温度
So what you need to do is find a temperature
你可以一周进入1-5 次
that you can get into one to five,
应该是一周1-3次
probably one to three times a week.
如果你真的想加速减肥的话
If you really want this to accelerate fat loss.
你要进去  直到你开始发抖
And you want to get in until you just start to shiver,
然后你要出去  不要弄干
and then you want to get out and not dry off,
等待一到三分钟不等
wait anywhere from one to three minutes
然后再回到寒冷的地方
and then get back into the cold.
那么  你会注意到当你回到寒冷的地方
Now, you'll notice when you get back into the cold,
这几乎会让人感到舒适
it'll almost seem soothing,
它实际上可能不会导致颤…
it might actually not induce shiv...
可能不会让你再颤抖了
It might take away the shiver that you had.
这是一种潜在的可重复的方案
So here's a potential kind of sets reps protocol
你可以使用的
that you can play with.
找到一个温度  然后诱导你颤抖
Find a temperature then induce a shiver for you.
这取决于你的耐寒性
That's going to vary depending on your cold tolerance
以及你对寒冷的适应能力
and how cold adapted you are.
一周1-3次,
One to three,
也许一周五次
maybe five times a week,
进入那个环境  直到你……
get in until you...
或者进入冲凉什么的
Or get under the shower or whatever it is,
直到你开始颤抖
until you start to shiver.
真正的颤抖
Genuinely shiver.
大约一分钟后  出去
Then after about a minute or so, get out,
出去一到三分钟  但不要擦干
spend one to three minutes out, but don't dry off,
回去待上一到三分钟
get back in for anywhere from one to three minutes,
但再试着进入颤栗点
but try and access the shiver point again.
你可以重复三次
And you might do three repetitions of that.
所以总共是3次进3次出
So it's three times in and three times out total.
这是一个很好的开始
That's a great starting place.
而你最好不要  很快就建立起忍耐力
And what you don't want to do is build up your tolerance
忍受寒冷
to cold so fast,
很快你就能抵抗住颤抖
that pretty soon you're able to resist the shiver,
因为记住  那个颤抖
because remember the shiver
是琥珀酸释放的来源
is the source of the succinate release
这会引发棕色脂肪的生热作用
that will trigger brown fat thermogenesis.
所以如果你想看详细的方案
So if you'd like to see this protocol spelled out,
你可以在网站上零成本地访问它
you can access it zero cost at a website
这是www.thecoldplunge.com
which is www.thecoldplunge.com.
Cold Plunge是一家生产冰水浴的公司
The Cold Plunge is a company they make cold plunges,
他们好心地给了我一个
and they were kind enough to gift one
给了HubermanLab播客一个冰水浴
to the Human Lab Podcast.
但我想强调的是  这些工具方法是免费的
But I want to emphasize that these protocols are free of cost.
Cold Plunge的人不仅感兴趣
The folks at the Cold Plunge are not just interested
营销他们的产品
in marketing their product,
但他们的主要兴趣之一是鼓励人们
but one of their main interests is encouraging people
对特定的时候暴露在寒冷中
to engage in cold exposure for particular end points
为了减肥、恢复力等目标
and goals like fat loss, resilience, et cetera.
抵抗炎症等
Resisting inflammation.
但他们的主要目标是为人们提供方案
But their main focus is providing people protocols
并鼓励人们使用各种冷暴露
and encouraging people to use cold exposure of various kinds
不仅仅是通过他们的产品
not just through their products,
而是穿过冰冷的河流  跳入大海
but through cold rivers and jumps in the ocean
比如洗冷水澡
and things like cold showers,
只要最方便就行
whatever is most convenient
对不同的人来说都是方便的
and accessible for various people.
所以我们需要一个可以
And so we needed a place where we could house
永久使用这些方案的地方
these protocols in a permanent way,
不仅仅是这一集
and not just for this episode.
但他们同意做的是
But so what they've agreed to do is,
在那里发布了各种方案
to post the protocols there,
应该很容易在他们的网站上找到
they should be very easy to find on their website.
我们指的是这个方案
This particular protocol we're referring
为脂肪消耗优化方案
to as the fat loss optimization protocol
因为没有更好的名字
for lack of a better name.
这是建立在寒冷的基础上的
And it's really grounded in how cold
它可以用来诱发颤抖
it can be used to induce shiver.
再说一次  这并不重要
And again, it doesn't really matter
你是如何得到寒冷的
how you're accessing that cold,
只要你能得到那个颤栗
provided you access to the shiver,
你从寒冷的环境中走出来
and you're moving from the cold environment
到一个稍微暖和一点的环境
to a slightly warmer environment.
洗完冷水澡
So getting out of the cold shower
或者从冰浴里出来  等等
or getting out of the ice bath, et cetera,
或者从冰冷的深渊中走出来
or out of the cold plunge,
然后再回来
and then back in.
因为事实证明冷却
Because it turns out that the cooling
身体重新升温的过程是颤抖的开始
and rewarming process of the body is where shiver kicks in.
这是截然不同与
And so that's distinctly different
仅仅是试图进入寒冷的环境
than just trying to get into the cold
尽可能长时间呆在寒冷的地方  这两者是不一样的
and stay in the cold for as long as possible.
如果你缩小一点
And if you zoom out a little bit
想想生活中的一些例子
and think about some examples in life,
你就会明白为什么会这样
you'll understand why that must be the case.
例如  经常在冷水中游泳的人
For instance, people who do a lot of cold water swims,
有这些“北极熊”俱乐部
you have these polar bear clubs,
我想他们是这样称呼自己的
I think they call themselves.
他们在冷水中游泳
They do these cold water swims.
我有时会看到这些人游来游去
I would sometimes see these people swimming back and forth
去恶魔岛之类的地方  这看起来很冒险
to Alcatraz and stuff like that, which it seems risky.
他们告诉我这很刺激
and they tell me it's very stimulating
对于精神和身体
for the mind and body.
太好了
Great.
有时这些人很瘦
Sometimes those people are very lean,
通常他们不瘦
oftentimes they're not,
他们暴露在寒冷中
and they're getting a lot of cold exposure.
发生的一件事是
And one of the things that happens is,
如果你一次又一次地暴露在寒冷中
if you expose yourself to cold over and over,
你会适应
you adapt,
你变得适应寒冷
you become cold adapted.
当你这样做的时候
And when you do that,
你不再得到肾上腺素
you no longer get the epinephrine,
因为寒冷释放出来的肾上腺素
the adrenaline release from the cold
因此你不会得到琥珀酸的释放
and therefore you don't get the succinate release
还有颤抖和棕色脂肪的生热效应
and the shivering and the brown fat thermogenic effect
并不会那么强烈
quite as intensely.
所以如果你想用冷来做其他事情
So if you want to use cold for other reasons,
当然  在冷水中游泳也很有趣
and certainly cold water swims can be fun.
你知道  只要你能安全地做
And there's, you know, long as you can do them safely,
这些运动非常好
they're great.
我曾经在冷水中
I've gotten into cold water swimming
游泳过一段时间
for some period of time.
你可以用冷来恢复身体  等等
You can use cold for resilience, et cetera.
但如果你想利用寒冷来减脂
But if you want to use cold to increase fat loss,
那么要用这种降温过程
then getting this shiver process going the cooling
受冷 再回暖  会加速
and rewarming which accelerates the amount of,
或者增加颤抖的程度
or increases the amount of shiver.
这才是正确的方法
That's going to be the way to go.
一个关于寒冷和一些
One note about cold and some of the factors
它释放的物质
that it releases.
几年前  有很多令人兴奋的研究
A few years back there was a lot of excitement
一种叫做鸢尾素的荷尔蒙
about this hormone called irisin, I-R-I-S-I-N,
这与寒冷有关
which was associated with cold.
大家都在研究这个
And there was a lot of excitement
关于它在促进新陈代谢方面的潜在作用
about its potential role in increasing metabolism
以至于人们开始探索
so much so that people were starting to explore
这是一种潜在的减肥药物
this as a potential fat loss drug.
据我所知  这毫无意义
To my knowledge that went nowhere.
科学最终转向了琥珀酸
The science eventually shifted over to succinate
它才是冷致生热的主要因素
as the main factor in cold induced thermogenesis
通过这个棕色脂肪通道
through this brown fat pathway.
但如果有人知道
But if anyone out there is aware
鸢尾素的积极作用
of any positive effects of iricin
或者任何我在这里忽略的鸢尾素的科学迹象
or of any signs of irisin that I'm overlooking here,
或者我说错了什么  请让我知道
or that I'm speaking about incorrectly, please let me know.
我很想知道
I'd be very curious to learn.
那么  我想再多谈谈棕色脂肪
Now, I want to just talk about brown fat a little bit more,
谈谈你生命中的一段时期
and talk about a period in your life
你体内富含棕色脂肪
in which you were rich with brown fat,
你体内有大量棕色脂肪
you had a ton of brown fat,
那是你还是个婴儿的时候
and that's when you were a baby.
婴儿不能颤抖
Babies can't shiver.
这些将肾上腺素释放出来到脂肪的神经元
These neurons that release epinephrin into fat
还没有完全形成
are not wired up and really aren't present
不在足够的水平或数量上
at sufficient levels or in sufficient numbers
当你还是个婴儿的时候
when you are a baby.
所以婴儿一样颤抖
And therefore you can't shiver as a baby,
在寒冷的环境中  婴儿也无法让自己很好地暖和起来
and you can't warm yourself up in cold environments very well
为了弥补这点
To compensate for that,
大自然赋予了我们所有人生命
mother nature installed in all of us
在生命早期棕色脂肪过多
an excess of brown fat early in life
它又出现在上背部
that exists again in the upper back,
还有后面的中间和脖子后面
and the middle of the back and the back of the neck.
如果我们不把自己暴露在寒冷的环境中
Over time if we don't expose ourselves to cold environments
或者做其他让人发抖的事情
or do other things that make a shiver,
我们减掉了很多棕色脂肪
we lose a lot of that brown fat,
但有趣的是棕色脂肪
but what's interesting about brown fat
有证据表明
is that there's some evidence
棕色脂肪和白色脂肪一样
that brown fat just like white fat
都可以增大尺寸
can both increase in size,
也可以添加新的细胞
but that you can also add new cells.
那么  有一点争议
Now, there's a little bit controversial.
人们总是说你无法改变脂肪细胞的数量
People always say you can't change the number of fat cells,
你可以缩小它们或增加它们的大小
you can just shrink them or increase their size.
结果发现肾上腺素释放了
Well, it turns out that epinephrin released
从这些褐色脂肪的小神经末梢
from these little nerve endings in brown fat
和琥珀酸在体内循环可能
and succinate circulating in the body may
我想强调一下“可能” 会有效果
and I want to underscore may have the effect
增加棕色脂肪细胞的数量
of increasing the amount of brown fat cells
可能是通过将这些米色脂肪细胞转化为棕色脂肪
probably by converting these beige fat cells into brown fat.
这让我们变得和早年一样
So that allows us to become much as we were early in life,
我们疯狂新陈代谢的青春期
where we metabolized like crazy
我们会让自己暖和起来  而不会发抖
and we'd heat ourselves up without shivering.
有些人把冷的东西发挥到了极致
Some people have taken the cold thing to the extreme,
把冰袋放在脖子后面
putting ice packs on the back of their neck
整整一天
throughout the day.
做了一集关于睾丸激素和雌激素的播客
Did a episode all about testosterone and estrogen,
这就是我们所说的  小众市场
and there's this, let's just call it a very niche,
我不得不说  是非常小众的
I have to imagine very, very niche culture of people
我没开玩笑
who are wearing literally, I'm not joking.
就是这些很冷的冰袋内裤
They are these cool pack ice pack underpants.
它们的名字我就不重复了
They go by a name that I'm not going to repeat on here,
但你可以在亚马逊上找到
but you can find them on Amazon.
这些人在身上使用冰袋
Those are people that are using cold packs on the body
在腹股沟上  试图增加一些东西
and on the groin to try and increase things
像睾丸激素之类的
like testosterone.
同时也试图增加生热作用
But as well to try and increase thermogenesis
并试图提高它们的新陈代谢
and trying to increase their metabolism.
只要记住  如果你适应了寒冷
Just remember if you become cold adapted,
你不会得到燃烧脂肪的效果
you're not going to get the fat burning effects
到同样的程度
to the same degree.
所以寒冷是减肥的有力工具
So cold is a powerful tool for fat loss,
但是你不想去适应
but you don't want to adapt.
这让人想起了一条规则
This is reminiscent of a rule
你在耐力训练中
that you hear about in endurance exercise
在力量锻炼中经常会听到的
and in strength exercise as well,
那就是  你想要使用小重量的有效刺激
which is, that you want to use the minimal effective stimulus
促进肌肉成长或进步
to promote growth or progress.
肌肉的生长或耐力的提高
So growth of a muscle or improvements in endurance.
如果你跑得更远或快  高于10%
If you go 10% further on a run or 10% faster,
你可能会看到性能的改善
you will likely see an improvement in performance
只要你下次继续的时候  能康复
provided your recovery the next time you come back
然后做同样的练习
and do that same round of exercise.
你就能做更多的训练
You'll be able to do more work
或者更容易地完成训练  等等
or complete the work more easily, et cetera.
你已经适应了
You've adapted.
如果你增加20%的距离或20%的重量
If you do 20% more distance or 20% more weight,
你不一定会看到跟10%小重量
you won't necessarily see the same
同样的结果  获得或改善的程度
commiserate level of gain or improvement.
寒冷也是如此
And so likewise with cold,
如果你要把30秒的寒冷
if you're quickly moving from 30 seconds of exposure
增加至10分钟
to 10 minutes of exposure,
你就错过了  通过以较小的增量来获得最大的脂肪损失
you're overlooking the opportunity to get the most fat loss
和加速新陈代谢
and increase in metabolism by stepping it up
的机会
in smaller increments.
好吧?
Okay?
这也说明了理论基础
And this also speaks to the rationale
利用冷暴露加速减肥
for using cold exposure to accelerate fat loss
对于特定的时期,
for certain periods,
但不要一年到头都这样做
but then maybe not doing it year round.
只要你的目标是减肥
If fat loss is your goal,
可能两三个月试一次
maybe use it for two, three months at a time
然后停两三个月
and then stop for two, three months at a time,
因为它是如此有力的刺激
because it is such a potent stimulus
只要你打个哆嗦就行
provided you engage in the shiver.
接下来我想谈谈锻炼以及具体的时间安排
Next I'd like to move to exercise and how particular timing
以及不同类型的可以极大的减脂的运动
and types of exercise can vastly improve fat loss.
在这之前
Before I do that,
我想提一个非常重要的参考资料
I just want to mention a really important reference
如果你们有兴趣了解更多
for those of you that are interested in learning more about
神经元是如何与脂肪连接的?
how neurons connect to fat?
这是一篇你们可以去看的论文
This is certainly a paper that you'd want to look at,
如果你有兴趣深入研究科研论文
if you're interested in diving deep into the literature
阅读各种各样的研究
and reading all the various studies.
这是一个评论性刊物
It's a review.
题目是白色脂肪组织的
And the title of the review is neural innervation
神经支配和脂肪分解的控制
of white adipose tissue and the control of lipolysis.
“白色脂肪组织的神经支配和脂肪分解的控制”
That's neural innervation of white adipose tissue and the control of lipolysis.
该研究发表在《神经内分泌学前沿》杂志上
It was published in Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology.
你可以在网上免费找到
You can find that free online.
他们有全文
They have the full text available.
第一位作者是Bartness, B-A-R-T-N-E-S-S
The first author is Bartness, B-A-R-T-N-E-S-S.
这是一篇很棒的评论
It's a great review.
我讲过很多东西
And I've talked about a number of things
都在这篇评论中提到
that are mentioned in the review.
参考那篇评论中的参考文献
Follow the references in that review
我们所说的参考线索
and the reference trail as we say,
如果你有兴趣了解更多
if you're interested in learning more about
神经元如何控制棕色脂肪
also how neurons control brown fat.
在我开始讲锻炼之前
And before I moved to exercise,
我还想强调一点
I also just want to highlight something
每隔几年就会出现一次
that comes up every few years
现在大部分被认为是错误的
and has largely been considered myth now,
但这实际上
but that is actually more interesting
比大多数人想的要更有趣
than most people might think,
这就是“局部瘦身”
which is this issue of spot reduction.
在八九十年代
You know, in the 80s and 90s,
有很多广告
there were a lot of commercials,
深夜商业信息广告
late night infomercials,
他们会讨论局部瘦身
where they would talk about spot reduction.
比如说  如果你做仰卧起坐  你可以减掉腹部脂肪
If you do sit ups, will you lose abdominal fat?
如果你做臀部抬高或臀大肌抬高
If you do hip raises or glute raises,
你可以减掉臀部的脂肪
will you lose gluten hip fat.
我想现在每个人都相信
And I think everybody knows now believes that,
了解脂肪代谢
and understands that fat metabolism
是全身系统发生的事情
is something that happens systemically throughout the body.
有些身体脂肪与其他部位相比
That some body fat is quote unquote more stubborn
更顽固
than others.
每个人储存脂肪的地方都不一样
Everyone varies in where they tend to store fat
或者最后减肥
or lose fat last.
影响它的因素很多
Number of factors that influence that,
尤其是荷尔蒙受体
and in particular hormone receptors.
但现在至少在科学文献中
But now at least in the scientific literature,
局部瘦身
spot reduction and the possibility of real
以有针对性的方式减脂的可能性
true spot reduction reductions in fat in a targeted way,
有针对性的身体部位或身体区域
a body part or body area targeted way
正在变得越来越现实  可能很快就会成为现实
is becoming more of a reality and may be a reality soon,
因为锻炼会触发激活
because exercise that triggers the activation
这些神经纤维
of these nerve fibers,
这些支配脂肪的神经元
these neurons that innervate fat.
理论上  如果你能增加肾上腺素的含量
In theory, if you can increase the amount of epinephrin
被释放在所谓的"脂肪垫"上
released at those particular fat pads as they're called,
它们实际上在科学文献中
they're actually called fat pads
叫做"脂肪垫"
in the scientific literature.
理论上  你可以增加
In theory, you could increase mobilization
特定的身体脂肪部位的动员
from those particular body fat sites.
因为新的观点  现代的理解
So because the new view that the modern understanding
肾上腺素系统不是在系统地释放
is that it's not adrenaline released systemically
不是覆盖住你的全部脂肪组织
kind of bathing all your fat tissue,
而是释放肾上腺素的局部神经元
but rather its neurons releasing adrenaline
理论上
epinephrin locally that in theory,
刺激肾上腺素释放的运动
exercise that stimulates the release of epinephrin
或者运动时伴有颤抖
or exercise coupled with things like shiver
或者轻微的震动运动
or low grade shaking movement,
或者NEAT  非运动生热作用
or the NEAT, the non-exercise activity thermogenesis
理论上能导致局部增强
could in theory lead to local enhancement
脂肪组织的动员
of mobilization of fat tissue.
所以我认为  局部瘦身
So I think that spot reduction
实际上很快就会成为可能
actually will soon be something that's possible
使用适当的技术
using the appropriate technology.
这对你来说意味着什么?
What does this mean for you now?
你现在能拿这个信息做什么呢?
What could you possibly do with this information now?
我觉得按照事实来说
Well, I think it speaks to the fact
如果一个人要参加锻炼
that if one is going to engage in exercise
做一些涉及到
that doing exercises that involve
很多不同的身体部位和动作
lots of different body parts and movements
可能会促进并维护
is likely to encourage the maintenance
这些神经元的生长
and or growth of these neurons
支配全身的脂肪
that innervate fat throughout the body.
这意味着改变锻炼模式
What this means is changing up the pattern of exercise,
进行新颖的运动
engaging in novel types of movements
可能是一种途径
may actually be one way that one can access
去让这些所谓的顽固体脂垫
these so-called stubborn body fat pads.
那么  在我的陈述中
Now, there's a little bit of speculation
是带有一点猜测的
in the statement that I'm making,
但如果你仔细想想  这是有道理的
but if you think about it it makes sense.
如果你变得非常适应一种特定的锻炼模式
If you become very adapted to a particular pattern
某种锻炼
of exercise,
不管你是不是低热量的
whether or not you're subcaloric or not,
你需要维持热量
you're on maintenance calories are not,
你总是在氧化一些脂肪
you are oxidizing some fat always,
你在利用支配脂肪的神经元
and you're utilizing the neurons that innervate fat
有规律地
in a regular way.
很快  神经支配就会关闭
And pretty soon this innervation is going to shut off,
因为没有理由神经支配脂肪
because there's no reason why this neural innervation of fat
应该继续释放肾上腺素吗
should continue to release epinephrin
除非你给它强烈的刺激  比如冷
unless you give it a strong stimulus like cold
或者细微动作  或者在这个例子中
or the fidgeting or in this case
做一些新奇的运动
to do novel forms of exercise.
这里有一些轶事证据
And there's some anecdotal evidence
我甚至不想称之为数据
and I don't even want to call it data,
但坊间证据表明
but anecdotal evidence that people who have,
顽固的身体脂肪
quote on quote stubborn body fat,
如果他们开始采用新的锻炼模式
if they start to adopt new patterns of exercise,
他们就会开始调用那些顽固的脂肪垫
they can start to access those stubborn fat pads.
再说一次  脂肪垫是正确的说法
And again, fat pads is the correct way
在科学文献中引用这些
to refer to these in the scientific literature.
所以我们今天关注的是事实
So what we're focusing on today is the fact
脂肪确实会被调动和氧化
that fat indeed will be mobilized and oxidized
是对卡路里不足的反应
in response to a deficit in calories.
而是神经元控制脂肪垫的方式
But that the way that neurons control those fat pads
身体的脂肪储存
and those body fat stores,
提供给你更多的控制
affords you a lot more control
也许比你以前想的要多
than perhaps you ever previously thought.
我们来谈谈运动
So let's talk about movement.
更传统的运动
And the more traditional kinds of movement,
也就是“锻炼”   被证明会增加
aka exercise has been shown to lead to increases
在新陈代谢和脂肪流失方面发挥更大的作用
in metabolism and fat loss to greater degrees
取决于各种因素
depending on whether or not for,
不管你是否禁食
instance you're fasted when you do it or not,
是否先做有氧运动
whether or not you do your cardio first
或者先进行抵抗力训练
or your resistance training first.
这也在文献中出现过
And this is again in the literature
对此有很多争议
for which there's a lot of controversy,
但通过对这些研究的深入研究
but in digging through all the studies on this,
我们终于开始达成共识
we're finally starting to arrive at a consensus of,
什么时候锻炼最好?
when is best to do exercise?
如果你的目标是减脂  你应该做什么运动?
And what types of exercise to do if your goal is fat loss?
运动这个话题是有争议的
The topic of exercise is a kind of controversial one,
没有营养和饮食那么有争议
not as controversial as nutrition and diet
我们一会儿会讲到
which we will talk about in a few minutes.
但这是一个特别有趣的问题
But it's a particularly interesting one,
因为不同类型的运动
because different types of exercising gauge
让身体的肌肉组织  心脏和肺
the musculature of the body and the heart and the lungs
以不同的方式参与进去
in different ways,
对身体的影响会有很大的不同
and can have vastly different effects on things
比如荷尔蒙和新陈代谢  取决于是否
like hormones and metabolism depending on whether
是高强度的
or not it's of high intensity,
中等强度或低强度
moderate intensity or low intensity.
所以与其考虑重量训练
So rather than think about weight training
心肺锻炼
versus cardiovascular exercise,
我认为想要流畅地讨论运动
I think the most simple way,
用最简单的话来讲
the most fluid way to have this conversation about exercise
就是 减脂主要有三种训练方式
and fat loss is in terms of three general types of training.
不管它是用负重还是自重来训练
Whether or not it's done with weights or body weight
其实并不重要
doesn't really matter.
这些都是高强度间歇训练
And those are high intensity interval training.
这似乎很受欢迎
Something that's seems to have gained a lot of popularity
近年来
in recent years.
所谓的HIIT  ,H-I-I-T
So-called HITT, H-I-I-T.
高强度间歇训练
So high intensity interval training.
Sprint间歇训练
Sprint interval training.
这是非常高强度的训练   SIT
So that's going to be very high intensity or SIT,
或中等强度持续训练  M-I-C-T
or moderate intensity continuous training, M-I-C-T.
我们有HIIT, SIT和MICT, M-I-C-T
So we've got HIIT, SIT and MICT, M-I-C-T.
如果你愿意  我们可以更精确一点
And we can get a little bit more precise if you'd like.
我不是那种在锻炼的时候会测量自己最大摄氧量的人
I'm not somebody who measures my VO2 max or anything while I exercise.
我一般都知道我是否在做一些
I generally know whether or not I'm doing something
我可以坚持很长一段时间的运动
I could continue for a very long time,
或者我是否在做
or whether or not I'm doing something
我意识到这将是短暂的
that I realize is going to be of short duration
高强度的运动
high-intensity.
但如果你想把它映射到最大VO2 SIT
But if you'd like to map this to VO2 max SIT,
这个短跑间歇训练被定义
this sprint interval training was defined
要一直大于100%的VO2
as all out greater than 100% of VO2 max
持续8到30秒的活动
bursts of activity that lasts eight to 30 seconds
与强度较低的恢复阶段穿插进行
intersperse with less intense recovery periods.
所以这是向前跑
So this would be sprinting downfield
在8到30秒内
for eight to 30 seconds,
然后再走回去一两分钟
then maybe walking back for about a minute or two
然后再次冲刺  然后继续
and then sprinting again and then continuing.
这就是SIT
So that would be SIT.
HIIT, H-I-I-T定义为次极大值
HIIT, H-I-I-T is defined as submaximal,
所以80%到100%的VO2最大爆发
so 80 to a hundred percent of VO2 max bursts of activity
持续60到240秒
that lasts 60 to 240 seconds
与强度较低的恢复阶段穿插进行
intersperse with less intense recovery periods.
在标准的400米赛道上
So on a standard 400 meter track,
让我们直观地了解一下
just to give this a little bit of a visual,
4分钟一英里对大多数人来说已经是很好的成绩了
a four minute mile would be fantastic for most people,
当然  有的人跑得更快
although people run faster than that of course.
这是4个60秒的圈
So that's four 60 seconds laps,
但这是连续的
but that's back to back to back.
我想在我状态最好的时候或者在梦里
I think in my best shape or maybe it was in my dreams,
我不记得了  我能做60秒一圈
I don't recall which I was able to do 60 seconds
在跑道上
around the track,
但我当然不能在持续进行第二圈
but of course I couldn't get that on the second
第三或第四圈  如果我这么做了  那肯定是
or third or fourth if I did that was certainly
在幻想而不是现实中
in the fantasy land and not reality.
但60秒大概是跑一圈的
But 60 seconds would be about one revolution
400m跑道
around the track,
也许90秒  取决于一个人跑得有多快
maybe 90 seconds, depending on how fast a one is running.
60到240秒
So 60 to 240 seconds.
MICT
MICT okay.
这种中等强度的持续训练
This moderate intensity continuous training
稳定状态的有氧运动有时也被称为Zone2有氧运动
is steady state cardio sometimes called Zone 2 cardio
现在在互联网上有的人会这么称这个运动
these days on the internet,
也就是连续了20 ~ 60分钟
which has performed continuously for 20 to 60 minutes
在中等强度下  VO2 最大值为40 ~ 60%
at moderate intensity of 40 to 60% of VO2 max
或者  达到55到70%的你的最高心率
or if you prefer heart rate 55 to 70% of max heart rate.
我们可以把它们想成高  中
So we can think about high, medium
以及低强度运动
and low intensity exercise.
虽然低强度通常意味着
Although low intensity usually means
你可以进行对话
that you could carry on a conversation,
或者你可能每走几步就得喘口气
or maybe you have to gasp every few steps or so,
一边说话一边跑
while trying to talk and run.
我认为这是最有用的方法
That's I think going to be the most useful way
我们现在的播客
to have this conversation that we're having now,
因为有很多不同形式人们所做的锻炼
because there's so many different forms of exercise
而强度是很重要的
that people do and intensity is important.
让我们问一个我想很多人都想问的问题
Let's ask the question that I think many people
大家都好奇
are wondering about,
哪个更好?
which is, is it better?
也就是说  如果你禁食锻炼  你会燃烧更多的脂肪吗?
Meaning do you burn more fat if you do your exercise fasted?
在这里禁食的意思是
And fasted in this respect could be that you wake up
第二天早上你醒来
in the morning,
你整晚都在禁食
you've been fasting all night,
你只需要补充水分  然后就去锻炼身体了
you just hydrate and you exercise
或者有时人们会摄入咖啡因
or sometimes people will ingest caffeine,
关于这一点  存在着争议
there's controversy as to whether or not that quote on quote
喝咖啡是否中断了禁食
breaks the fast.
这与你是否适应咖啡因有关
It has to do with whether or not your caffeine adapted
另一集的东西
something for another episode.
无论如何都要禁食
In any case that would be fasted.
所以可能什么都没吃
So probably not having eaten anything
3到24小时  甚至更久
for anywhere from three to 24 hours or maybe even more.
你也可以在下午禁食
As you could also be fasted in the afternoon.
如果你在中午吃午饭  现在是四点
If you had lunch at noon and it's four
或者下午5点或6点
or five or 6:00 p.m.
那么  你会燃烧更多脂肪吗？
Is it, will you burn more fat
前提是不吃任何东西就锻炼
if you exercise without an eating anything first,
没有摄入任何热量
without ingesting any calories first?
人们试图在这个问题上刨根究底
And people have tried to really split hairs on this,
人们总是说
every which way people say,
嗯  你可以很快地变胖
well, you can fat fast,
因为脂肪和蛋白质
because fat and protein doesn't lead
不像胰岛素和其他物质一样会大幅增加
to as great increases in insulin as other things,
也许你可以吃几颗杏仁  然后继续训练
maybe you can have a few almonds and then still train.
胰岛素确实可以防止脂肪氧化
And indeed insulin will prevent fat oxidation.
我想澄清一下
I want to be really clear.
细胞中燃烧脂肪的部分
The burning part of fat in the cell,
脂肪酸的运动进入线粒体
the movement of the fatty acid and into mitochondria
变成ATP   胰岛素的转换会抑制这个过程
and the conversion ATP, insulin inhibits that process.
然而  科研已经证明了
However, it's been shown
至少对于短期的训练
that it least for short periods of training,
你在训练之前吃不吃
it doesn't really seem to matter whether or not you eat
似乎并不重要
before training or you don't,
如果你的目标是脂肪氧化
if your goal is fat oxidation.
那么  我想在这个言论旁边放一个星号
Now, I want to put an asterix near that,
因为有一些例外
because there are some exceptions.
但有几项研究是这样做的
But there were several studies done that,
其中最经典的一种
and the kind of the classic ones of these,
我来念给你听
I'll read out to you.
他们所做的就是给人们葡萄糖  糖
What they basically did is they gave people glucose, sugar,
在训练前提高他们的血糖
to increase their blood sugar before training or not.
这方面最经典的研究是阿尔·博格
And the kind of classic study of this is Al Borg at all.
1976年  这要追溯到很久以前
So in 1976, so it goes way back,
葡萄糖可以减脂燃烧和运动
which is that glucose reduces fat burning and exercise.
还有一些其他的研究如果你想查的话
And then some other studies if you want to look these up,
在PubMed上很容易找到
they're very easy to find on PubMed.
你输入1999年  Horowitz
You put in Horowitz 1999,
Lee 等人  是另外一个研究者
is another one where they have people
喝含葡萄糖的牛奶
drink milk with glucose in it.
比如运动前喝甜牛奶等等
So sweet sugary milk before exercise, et cetera.
你可以找到一些例子
And you can find a number of examples
运动前吃东西
where eating before exercise reduces the amount of fat
会减少在运动过程中会被氧化的脂肪量
that's oxidized during the exercise.
你也可以发现很多研究表明
And you can also find a lot of studies showing that,
在运动期间或运动前进食
eating during exercise or prior to exercise
不会减少被氧化的脂肪量
will not reduce the amount of fat that is oxidized.
然而  锻炼的类型
However, the types of exercise
无论是中等强度还是高强度
whether I was medium intensity or high intensity
或者低强度  在每个研究中都非常不同  都有
or low intensity is all over the map for these studies.
所以很难找到一个理想的方案
So it's very hard to target an ideal protocol.
如果你深入研究文献
And then if you look really deep in the literature,
你开始发现元分析
you start to find meta analysis
人们把所有的发现都汇总在一起
where people have actually aggregated all the findings
以及它所指向的现代研究
and some modern studies where it points
一些非常具体和有用的工具方法
to some very specific and useful protocols.
接下来我讲一下规则或方案
And so here's the rule that or the protocol
我从文献中提取的
that I extracted from that literature.
每次90分钟左右
At a period of about 90 minutes
中等强度的运动
of moderate intensity exercise,
我想说清楚
I want to be clear,
大约90分钟中等强度运动后
at about or after 90 minutes of moderate intensity exercise.
有一个切换点
There's a switchover point
如果你在运动前吃了东西
whereby if you ate before the exercise,
你会减少  不好意思
you will reduce, excuse me,
从90分钟开始  你会消耗更少的脂肪
you will burn far less fat from the 90 minute point onward
如果你在训练前禁食的话  情况就不同
than you would if you had gone into the training fasted.
我重复一下
So let me repeat that.
如果是中等强度
If it's moderate intensity,
所谓的Zone2有氧运动
so-called zone two cardio type exercise,
90分钟的时候
at the 90 minute point,
如果你在运动前吃了东西
if you happen to have eaten before the exercise
在运动前一到三个小时内
within one to three hours prior to the exercise,
那么90分钟后  你就会减少你要燃烧的脂肪量
then you reduce the amount of fat that you will burn from 90 minutes onward,
然而  如果你在运动前禁食
whereas if you had fasted prior to the exercise,
你已经三个多小时没吃东西了
you hadn't eaten anything for three hours or more prior
90分钟时  锻炼90分钟后
At the 90 minute point, 90 minutes of exercise
你会开始燃烧更多的脂肪
you will start to burn more fat than you would
相比于你进食的情况
had you eaten.
90分钟中等强度的运动已经很多了
Now, 90 minutes of moderate intensity exercises is a lot.
这是一段相当长的时间
So that's a pretty long run.
即使你以相当慢的速度跑步
Even if you're running at a pretty slow pace
比如10或12分钟一英里  那也是很多跑步
like a 10 or 12 minute mile, that's a lot of running,
那是很多的游泳
that's a lot of swimming.
所以要走很多路
So that's a lot of walking,
那是很多的徒步旅行
that's a lot of hiking.
然而  也有人整天都在徒步旅行
However, there are people who are going out hiking all day
或者整天跑步或散步
or running all day or walking all day.
如果你想在单位时间内燃烧更多脂肪
And if you want to burn more fat per unit time,
如果你想氧化更多的脂肪  你最好是禁食
you want to oxidize more fat then you would do that fasted.
那么  也有研究指出了这个事实
Now, there are also studies that pointed the fact
你不需要等90分钟
that you don't have to wait to 90 minutes
为了达到燃烧脂肪的效果
in order to get this enhanced fat burning effect.
我能找到的研究
The studies I was able to find
在我看来  这是高质量的同行评议研究
and that looked to me like quality peer-reviewed studies
不含有商业公司的偏见  也没有任何产品偏见
with no company bias or no product bias of any kind.
这些研究大部分都是有资金支持的
These are studies that were largely funded
由联邦政府出资  在大学中进行的
by the federal government in the university context
他指出  如果一个人进行高强度训练
pointed the fact that if one does high-intensity training,
甚至是高强度的训练
or even the very high intensity forms of training
比如短跑、下蹲或硬举
like sprints or squats or deadlifts
或者任何无法维持的活动
or any kind of activity that can't be maintained
不止这些
for more than these, you know, eight
8-60秒
or I would say up to 60 seconds.
所以一组举重动作重复  重复
So a set of lifting weights repeated, repeated,
如果这样持续了20分钟
if that's done for anywhere from 20 minutes,
重量训练或力量举重
so weight training or power lifting
或者像这样的事  或者是壶铃
or these kinds of things or kettlebell swings
或者最多60分钟
or up to 60 minutes,
然后我们来看看转换点
we'll then the switchover point
你可以燃烧更多的脂肪
in which you can burn more fat,
如果你训练前禁食  这个转换点会更快到来
if you go into that fasted comes earlier.
这说得通  因为这个90分钟没有特殊的
And this makes sense because there's nothing holy
中等强度运动
about the 90 minute point for a medium intensity
Zone2有氧运动
Zone 2 cardio.
那90分钟就是
That 90 minute point is the point
在这个过程中  身体从主要消耗糖原的状态  开始转换
in which the body shifts over from mainly burning glycogen,
基本上是来自肌肉或肝脏的糖
basically, sugar that comes from muscles or the liver
意识到这种情况已经持续了一段时间
and realizes this is going on for a while,
我要把燃料转移到储存地点
I'm going to shift over to a storage site fuel
需要一些储备 比如身体脂肪
that is in reserve like body fat.
这种情况会持续一段时间
This is going to happen for a while,
所以我要开始利用身体脂肪储备
so I'm going to start tapping into body fat stores.
那么  脂肪没有大脑
Now, fat doesn't have a little brain there.
它受神经元支配  但没有思想
It is innervated by neurons, but it doesn't have thoughts.
你不能用你的思想来控制这个开关
And you don't actually control this switch with your mind.
这和环境有关
This is something that has to do with the milieu
各种激素
of various hormones.
需要做的是  胰岛素必须降得足够低
What has to happen is insulin has to go down far enough.
如果你在运动前吃了东西
So if you ate before the exercise,
胰岛素会增加
you'd have an increase in insulin,
如果你吃碳水化合物
if you ate carbohydrates
你的胰岛素  脂肪和蛋白质会有更大的增加
you'd have a bigger increase in insulin, fat and proteins
事实上  你会有更少的胰岛素
indeed you'll have lower amounts of insulin
禁食会给你提供最低量的胰岛素
and fasting will give you the lowest amount of insulin.
那么转换点就会提前
Well, then that switch over point is going to come earlier
在运动中
in the exercise.
你仔细想  如果你要做
And if you think about if you were to do something
高强度训练20 30 40分钟
high intensity for 20, 30, 40 minutes,
比如说是举重  然后进入Zone2有氧运动
so maybe lift weights and then get into Zone 2 cardio.
文献上说  如果你禁食了
If you are fasted, the literature says
单位时间内会燃烧更多的脂肪
that you're going to burn more body fat per unit time
比运动前或运动中吃东西的人要多
than if you had eaten before or during the exercise.
这意味着什么呢?
So what does this mean?
这意味着如果你想燃烧更多的身体脂肪
This means if you want to burn more body fat,
如果这是你们的工具方法
if it's in your protocols
你已经被批准可以安全地做这件事了
and you have been approved to do this safely,
剧烈运动20到60分钟
exercise intensely for 20 to 60 minutes,
强度越高  很明显
the higher the intensity obviously the shorter
转换点会越快地到来
that about is going to be,
然后进入Zone 2 有氧运动
and then move over into Zone 2 cardio.
如果你禁食或中等强度的有氧运动
And if you do that fasted or the medium intensity cardio
我应该说
I should say.
如果你禁食的话
And if you do that fasted,
这样你就可以燃烧更多的脂肪
then indeed you will burn a higher percentage of body fat.
如果你需要吃东西或者你喜欢在训练前吃东西
If you need to eat or you like to eat before you train
这也可以实现
that also can work.
如果你的训练强度很大
And if you train very intensely,
你很可能也会更快的转向脂肪燃烧模式
you're likely to shift over to the fat burning pattern more quickly as well.
再说一次  问题不是在
So again, this isn't really an issue
你锻炼了多长时间
of how long you exercise.
这是你运动强度的问题
It's an issue of how intensely you exercise
也就是你所使用的燃料来源
and therefore what fuel source you're drawing from.
希望我已经讲清楚了
So hopefully I've made that clear,
但基本上你需要消耗糖原
but basically you need to deplete glycogen
或者通过高强度运动
or through high intensity exercise
然后进入稳定状态的练习
and then move to a steady state exercise
这会让你燃烧更多的脂肪
that will allow you to burn more fat.
或者你需要中等强度的训练
Or you need to perform a medium intensity
或者长时间的低强度运动
or low intensity type exercise for a long period of time
在你转向燃烧脂肪之前
before you shift over to burning fat.
事实上  似乎所有这些都指向了
And indeed it seems that going into all that fasted
禁食会促进脂肪的燃烧
will facilitate the burning of more fat overall.
但如果你连锻炼都做不到
But if you can't even get to the exercise,
如果你根本不能接受训练
if you're somebody who just can't do the training at all,
你不愿意或者你没有能力训练
you're unwilling to or you're incapable of training,
除非你吃点东西
unless you eat something,
显然吃点东西才是最合理的
then obviously eating something makes the most sense.
运动前吃什么
And what you eat prior to exercise,
这完全是另一个人们争论的话题
that's a whole other biz that people argue about
大家都在吵
and fight about whether or not you should go
要低碳水化合物 还是高碳水化合物  所有这些
into it with low carbohydrates or higher carbs, all of that.
但总的来说  主题很简单
But in general, the theme there is very simple.
你希望胰岛素水平很低
Which is that you want insulin levels to be pretty low
如果你的目标是减脂
if your goal is body fat reduction,
如果你想氧化身体脂肪
if you want to oxidize body fat.
在某些情况下禁食
So fasting in some cases,
禁食减肥等案例
fat fasting and other cases
你只是在摄入脂肪
where you're just ingesting fats.
脂肪和蛋白质  在某些情况下或者对某些人来说
Fat and protein, in some cases or for some people
就是吃碳水化合物
it will be eating carbohydrates.
我来这里不是要规定一种特定的营养养生法
I'm not here to dictate a particular nutrition regimen.
这就是这些东西的荷尔蒙平衡
That's just how the hormone balance of these things
还有脂肪氧化  就是这么起作用的
and fat oxidation works.
那么  有一件事很有趣
Now, one thing that's very interesting
而不可忽视的一个问题
and cannot be overlooked is this issue
就是你在运动中和运动后消耗了多少能量
of how much energy you burn during and after the activity.
你们中的一些人可能已经知道了
And some of you probably already know about this,
但是卡路里摄入和卡路里消耗之间的关系
but the whole business of calories in versus calories out,
人们计算卡路里的数量
and people counting the number of calories
他们在有氧运动过程中会燃烧
they burn during their aerobic session
或者在他们的各种运动期间
or during their whatever session
只是问题的一半
is only one half of the equation
它掩盖了更重要的问题
and it really eclipses the more important issue,
也就是  在某项运动之后
which is how much of an increase in metabolism
它在代谢的增加上  产生了多少效果?
does a given exercise create after the exercise?
我们可以聊上几个小时
And we could talk for hours about this,
但最简单的方法是
but the simple way to view this is that,
高强度训练  无氧训练
high intensity training, anaerobic training
举重训练  短跑  波比跳  等等
of weight training, sprints, burpees, any kind of thing.
我不知道最近  我听说你不应该做波比跳
I don't know these days I hear that you're not supposed
人们认为波比跳很危险
to do burpees that people think burpees are dangerous.
所以我并不是在推荐什么特定的动作
So I'm not suggesting any particular movements here.
你得决定什么最适合你
You have to decide what's right for you.
我自己会做波比跳
I do burpees.
我似乎并没有因此受伤
I don't seem to be injured from them,
但我听说它们对一些人来说很可怕
but I hear that they're terrible for some people.
不管怎样  俯卧撑  仰卧起坐
So anyway, push-ups, sit-ups,
不管是什么无氧运动
whatever it happens to be that anaerobic exercise
也就是更高强度的运动  或者冲刺
that's of higher intensity or sprints
在运动过程中利用储存的糖原
taps into glycogen stores during the movement
单位时间内会消耗更多的能量
and we'll burn more energy per unit time
中等强度
than moderate intensity.
高强度燃烧比中等强度燃烧的更多
High intensity burns more than modern intensity.
这很好理解
That's straightforward.
有趣的是  所有的研究
What's interesting is that all the studies
我所能找到的
that I was able to find on what happens
在那种类型的锻炼之后
after that type of exercise showed
就是你燃烧的脂肪的百分比
that the percentage of fat that you burn
高强度运动后的效果实际上更大
after high intensity exercise is actually greater.
换句话说  你消耗了大量的糖原
In other words, you burn a lot of glycogen
在高强度运动中
during the high intensity exercise.
然后在锻炼之后
And then after the exercise,
运动后耗氧量
the post exercise oxygen consumption
它会上升
as it sometimes called goes up.
经过高强度训练后  我们知道这一点
We know this after you train intensely
运动后耗氧量增加
that post exercise oxygen consumption goes up
有时长达24小时
sometimes for up to 24 hours.
就是在那段时间
And it is during that period of time
你氧化了更多的脂肪而不是糖原
that you oxidize more fat not glycogen.
有趣的是反过来也是正确的
Now, what's interesting is that the reverse is also true,
对于那些长期处于
for people that do long bouts of low
低强度或者中等强度的运动的人来说
or moderate intensity exercise.
典型的例子是跑步
So typically this would be things like running,
游泳  骑自行车等等
swimming, biking, et cetera.
60分钟  90分钟  2小时
So 60, 90 minutes, two hours
甚至可能是那些正在为马拉松训练的人
maybe even people that are training for marathons
或半马拉松,
or half marathons,
当他们停止训练时
when they stop training,
它们消耗更多糖原  更多碳水化合物
they burn more glycogen, more carbohydrate,
即使他们在单位时间内燃烧了更多的脂肪
even though they were burning more body fat per unit time
在低强度运动中
during the low intensity exercise.
所以这是一种倒置
So there's this kind of inversion.
高强度运动会消耗更多的糖原
High-intensity burns more glycogen during the activity,
更多的身体脂肪
more body fat afterwards.
中等到低强度的燃烧百分比更高
Moderate to low intensity burns more percentage-wise
被氧化的体脂比糖原多
more body fat is oxidized than glycogen
在实际的运动之后  更多的是糖原
during the actual exercise afterward it's more glycogen.
我不想把它弄得太复杂
So I don't want this to get too complicated.
重点是你应该选择你喜欢的运动
The point is you should pick exercise that you like,
你能经常做的运动
that you're going to do regularly,
但似乎高强度运动
but it does seem that the high intensity exercise
其次是中等强度的运动
followed by moderate intensity exercise
是燃烧脂肪的最佳方式
is going to be optimal for fat burning overall.
因为当你观察身体脂肪燃烧的百分比时
Because when you look at the percentage of body fat burned,
你可以看到在中高强度训练中
and you look at the overall increase
基础代谢率
in basal metabolic rate,
在整体上的增长
moderate and high intensity training
最后是低强度训练
followed by low intensity training
或者只是接着回归日常生活中去
or even just followed by going back into life
是继续燃烧身体脂肪的最好方法
is going to be the best way to continue to burn body fat
因为中高强度训练增加了基础代谢率
because of the ways that it increases basal metabolic rate.
这可以提炼成一个简单的方案
This could be distilled into a simple protocol
每周三到四次
whereby three or four times a week
你做高强度训练  练完之后要么什么都不做
you do high intensity training followed by either nothing
或随后进行低强度训练
or followed by low intensity training
尤其是如果你能禁食的话
especially if you're able to do that fasted.
我想说的是  这些关于禁食的方案
And I should just mention that none of this stuff
与运动的表现没有任何关系
about fasted is about performance.
如果你想表现得很好
If you want to perform really well,
这是出于运动表现的考虑
this is for reasons of performance
比如说某一项运动或比赛
and you want to, you know, it's for a sport or a competition,
这时候就不是为了减少身体脂肪了
it's not for body fat purposes.
好吧  那么所有这些都不成立
Well, then all of this kind of falls away
你需要根据理想的运动表现对饮食进行调整
and is modified by what's ideal to eat for performance.
但我们今天要讲的是
But what we're talking about today
就是如何优化身体的脂肪消耗
is how to optimize body fat loss.
所以要进行中等强度到高强度的训练
So train moderately to very high intensity
然后是中等强度到低强度
and then moderate to low intensity,
或者进行中等强度到高强度的训练
or train moderate to high intensity,
然后继续生活
and then go about life.
事实上  我有个朋友就用这种方法
And in fact, I have a friend who uses this strategy.
他非常喜欢高强度运动
He likes the train intensely
但不会经常锻炼  因为他是个很忙的人
and not that often protocol cause he's a very busy person.
所以他会进行20到30分钟的高强度训练
So he'll train for 20 or 30 minutes intensely
通过举重或者只是自重的运动
with weights or just body weight movement doing a lot,
他做俯卧撑  波比跳  仰卧起坐和引体向上
he does burpees and push-ups and sit-ups and pull-ups
是一种移动和循环训练
and just kind of moving and kind of circuit type training.
但是当他呼吸非常困难的时候
But where he's breathing really hard,
他常说的目标是
the goal he always says is,
我想每天用力呼吸30分钟
I want to breathe hard for 30 minutes every day.
然后他补充水分  喝咖啡
And then afterwards he hydrates and drinks coffee
然后开始他的一天
and moves into his day.
他到处走动  接电话
And he's walking around and taking calls
带着他的孩子
and carrying around his children
做这些事情
and doing all these kinds of things
开始忙自己的事情
that keep him really busy
这有点像低强度的工作
which is kind of like low intensity work.
我想你们现在明白了
So I think you get the principle now.
但你们都应该问问自己
But you should all be asking yourselves
作为你们自身的科学家
as scientists of yourselves.
为什么是特定的锻炼模式
Why would it be that certain patterns of exercise
会导致更多还是更少的脂肪减少?
would lead to more or less fat loss?
我是说  这不只是能量消耗的问题
I mean, it can't just be about the energy burn.
我们已经确定了
We already established that.
同样  这与神经元有关
And again, it has to do with the neurons.
这与我们如何激活神经系统有关
It has to do with how we engage the nervous system.
因此  当非运动活动引起的生热作用  也就是NEAT
So while non-exercise activity induced thermogenesis, NEAT,
细微动作和寒冷会引起生热
the fidgeting and cold can induce thermogenesis
通过颤抖、紧张或低水平的动作
by engaging shiver tight movement or low-level movements.
高强度的大运动
Big movements that are of very high intensity,
这意味着需要付出很多努力
meaning they require a lot of effort,
从我们的神经元中释放大量的肾上腺素
deploy a lot of adrenaline epinephrin from our neurons
并对特定类型的脂肪发出信号
and signal particular types
产生生热作用  脂肪氧化
and amounts of fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation,
而低强度运动
whereas low level intensity exercise,
低或中等强度的运动
low or moderate intensity exercise,
走路、跑步、骑自行车
walking, running, biking
你可以很容易地做到
where you can do that easily,
肾上腺素释放不多
there's not very much adrenaline release.
肾上腺素
So adrenaline aka epinephrin
真的是任何形式的运动
is really the final common path
在神经系统间最终汇集的通路
by which movement of any kind,
不管是不是低水平的颤抖
whether or not it's low level shiver,
不管是举杠铃  还是冲刺上坡
whether or not it's lifting a barbell sprinting up a hill
或者骑很长时间的自行车
or doing a long bike ride.
肾上腺素是减肥的效应器
Adrenaline is the effector of fat loss.
这是触发端  这是执行器
It's the trigger end, it's the effector.
现在我想把注意力转到化合物上
So now I want to turn our attention to compounds
能增加肾上腺素的化合物
that increase epinephrin and adrenaline,
以及在外部使用的化合物
as well as compounds that work outside
能提高肾上腺素
the adrenaline epinephrin pathway
来提高脂肪减少的速度
to increase the rates of fat loss.
我几乎总是保留化合物和补充剂
I almost always save compounds and supplements
诸如此类的事情一直到最后
and things of that sort to the end,
因为我认为人们应该先建立起
because I do believe that people should look first
对行为工具和科学的理解
towards behavioral tools and an understanding of the science
在他们看补品之前
before they look toward a supplement
或者是一种他们可以从饮食中提取的特殊物质
or a particular thing that they can extract from diet.
这主要是试图不让大家觉得
This is mainly to try and shift people away
会有某种”神奇药丸“现象
from the kind of magic pill phenomenon or the idea
觉得有神奇的药丸  因为真的没有
that there is a magic pill because there really isn't.
坦白说  永远不会有
And frankly, there never will be.
但是有一些化合物
But there are some compounds
这会大大增加脂肪的氧化和动员
that can greatly increase fat oxidation and mobilization.
了解哪些化合物会增加氧化
And understanding which compounds increase oxidation
或者动员是非常有用的
or mobilization can be very useful
如果你的目标是加速减肥
if your goal is to accelerate fat loss.
有些东西是人们可以消化的
There are things that people can ingest
这会让他们氧化更多的脂肪
that will allow them to oxidize more fat.
这主要是通过增加
And that occurs mainly by increasing the amount
由神经元释放的肾上腺素的数量来实现的
of epinephrin that is released from neurons
也就是连接脂肪组织的神经元
that innovate fat tissue.
其中一个比较常见
One of the more common ones is one
你可能已经在使用了  就是咖啡因
that you may already be using which is caffeine.
众所周知  咖啡因可以提高运动表现
It's well-established that caffeine can enhance performance,
如果你已经适应了咖啡因
if you're caffeine adapted.
我在之前的一集里讲过
I talked about this in an earlier episode
所以我想确保我讲得很清楚
so I want to make sure I'm very clear about this.
如果你不习惯喝咖啡因
If you are not used to drinking caffeine
然后你突然决定
and you suddenly decide I'm going to drink
训练前喝一大杯咖啡
a big cup of coffee before training,
你的血管会收缩  你的运动表现会受到限制
you will vasoconstrict and you will limit performance.
这是运动表现
So that's performance.
如果你适应了咖啡因
If you're caffeine adapted however,
有一种有趣的现象
there's this kind of interesting phenomenon
也就是你摄入的咖啡因
where ingestion of caffeine
更多的是作为运动表现提升物
serves more as a performance enhancer,
通过提高警觉性
both by increasing alertness,
也可以通过扩张血管
but also by way of dilating vasculature
允许更多的血液流动
of allowing more blood flow.
那么  咖啡因可以燃烧更多的脂肪进行氧化
Now, caffeine for burning more fat for oxidizing
调动更多的脂肪是一个有趣的问题
and mobilizing more fat is an interesting one.
如果想要有效  剂量要达400毫克
It can be effective at dosages up to 400 milligrams.
如果你对咖啡因敏感  那就得小心了
You have to be careful if you're caffeine sensitive.
有些人只摄入一点点咖啡因
Some people have just the littlest bit of caffeine
脑子就跟炸了一样
and their mind goes crazy,
他们很不舒服
and they're very uncomfortable.
它可能对一些人的心血管有影响
It can have cardiovascular effects for some people
或者高血压等等
or hypertension, et cetera.
所以请咨询你的医生
So please check with your doctor.
但400毫克大约相当于一杯半咖啡
But 400 milligrams is roughly a cup and a half a coffee
或者两杯咖啡
or two cups of coffee.
我们生活的当下  咖啡中含有更多的咖啡因
Nowadays, there's a lot more caffeine in coffee.
如果你去一家普通的咖啡馆
So if you go to a typical cafe
你要一杯中杯的
and you were to get their medium-sized
大概含有一克咖啡因
that would have close to a gram of caffeine,
这就是为什么  如果你经常喝咖啡
which is why, if you're a regular caffeine consumer
如果某一天你得不到那克咖啡因
and you don't get that gram of caffeine
你会感到头痛
in your coffee each day, you will get a headache.
它能引起血管的收缩和扩张
It can cause constriction and dilation of blood vessels
这很复杂
in ways that's complicated,
但是你可能会头疼的
but you'll get a headache.
有些人喜欢喝咖啡的感觉
Some people like the way they feel drinking
100到200,300或者400毫克的咖啡因
100 to 200, 300 maybe 400 milligrams of caffeine
在训练之前
before training.
事实上  这会导致脂肪氧化增加
And indeed that will lead to increase fat oxidation.
这是因为你会释放更多的肾上腺素
It will do that because you will release more epinephrin
和肾上腺素
and adrenaline.
让我们把它放在
So let's just place this in the context
我们之前讨论的背景下
of what we said previously.
假设你通常做Zone 2 有氧运动
Let's say you normally do Zone 2 cardio,
所以比如你去做一次中等强度的跑步
so you're going out for a moderately intense run
30到60分钟左右
for 30 to 60 minutes or so.
我认为美国目前的建议指导方针
I think the current recommendation guidelines in the States
是人们要在每周五天中
are that people engage in 30 minutes
参与30分钟的中等强度的锻炼
of moderate intensity exercise five days a week
那是150分钟
for that's 150 minutes.
如果他们的目标是提高
If their goal is to improve
或维持心血管系统的健康
or maintain health of the cardiovascular system.
80%的美国人都没有做到
80% of people in the United States fail to do that,
甚至都没有靠近这个目标
or anything close to it.
我们远低于政府
We are way below threshold for what the government
建议的门槛
has recommended.
在这种情况下  政府建议
In this case, the government recommendations,
我觉得非常好
I think are pretty good.
当然  我们总可以做得更好
That's one could always do better of course.
但80%的人根本就不这么做
But 80% of people aren't even doing that.
但是  仅仅使用逻辑
However, just using the logic
了解了肾上腺素是如何
and the understanding of how epinephrin adrenaline
影响脂肪的氧化过程
is affecting this fat oxidation process.
如果你出去15分钟
If you were to go out for 15 minutes
你去之前喝了咖啡因
and you drank caffeine before you went,
是的  单位时间内你可能会氧化更多的脂肪
yes, you'll probably oxidize more fat per unit time.
仅仅通过喝咖啡因
Can you compensate for the exercise
就能弥补你没有做的运动吗？
you're not doing just by drinking caffeine?
嗯  可能吧  如果你只是在谈论减肥
Well, probably if you were just talking about fat loss,
如果咖啡因让你经常坐立不安  对吧?
if that caffeine makes you fidget a lot, right?
你在30分钟的跑步中消耗的卡路里
The amount of calories that you burn in a 30 minute run,
除非跑得很激烈
unless the run is very intense
你穿着重量背心  爬坡
and you're wearing a weight vest and it's up a hill,
感觉没那么好  对吧?
it's not that great, right?
最终消耗的能量
Then you probably get you in somewhere
大概是400到500卡路里的燃烧
into the 400, 500 calories burned area.
但我之前说过  现在有很多数据
But I said earlier, and there are a lot of data now
都支撑了  一天中的细微动作
to support that fidgeting for a day
每天可以燃烧800到2500卡路里
can burn anywhere from 800 to 2,500 calories a day.
所以你可能会说  细微动作比跑步好
So you might say, well, fidgeting is better than running,
但它不会触发激活
ah, but it doesn't trigger the activation
对心血管系统的
and the positive health effects
健康的积极影响
of the cardiovascular system.
所以  单独来看坐立不安是很好的
So fidgeting alone can be great,
但你需要锻炼还有其他原因
but you need exercise for other reasons.
咖啡因会增加脂肪消耗
Caffeine can enhance the amount of fat
在任何时间的运动中都是这样
that you burn in any duration of exercise.
它可以改变你氧化的
And it can shift the percentage of fat
脂肪与糖原的比例
that you oxidize compared to glycogen.
除非你喝了咖啡因  它让你兴奋了很多
Unless you take that caffeine and it ramps you up so much
你训练得非常非常高强度
that you're training really, really intensely.
底线是
The bottom line is,
如果你喜欢咖啡因  并且可以安全地使用
if you like caffeine and you can use it safely,
摄入100-400毫克的咖啡因
ingesting somewhere between 100-400 milligrams of caffeine
锻炼前的30到40分钟
prior to exercise somewhere between 30 to 40 minutes
可以有益
before exercise can be beneficial
前提是我们说的是脂肪氧化  燃烧更多的身体脂肪
if we're talking about fat oxidation burning more body fat.
这是咖啡因
So that's caffeine.
还有很多其他的事情
There are a number of other things
多年来一直存在于这一途径中
that have existed over the years that are in this pathway,
像麻黄碱  现在在大多数州都是非法的
things like ephedrine which is now illegal in most states,
我想可能是所有州
I think maybe an all states
因为有人因为服用麻黄碱而死亡
because people were dropping dead from taking ephedrine,
因为它会让人体的问题升的太高
because they were heating up too much.
有趣的是它对心脏没有直接影响
It's interesting it wasn't direct effects on the heart
导致心脏病
causing heart attack.
它可以通过肾上腺素能受体来触发
It could trigger by way of adrenergic receptors.
如果你想知道
If you'd like to know,
体温和热量的增加
increases in body temperature and heat.
那么  那些药物被证明是危险的
Now, those drugs turned out to be dangerous,
因为人们过热而死亡
because people were overheating and dying.
当时还掀起了一股芬芬热
There was also the big Fen-Phen craze.
那是一种被释放的药物芬氟拉明
That was a drug that was released fenfluramine
其实这种药
which actually was quite effective
作为一种抗肥胖药物  是有效的
as an anti obesity drug,
治疗肥胖   也必须被禁止
a treatment for obesity that had to be outlawed as well.
原本FDA的批准被取消了
It was FDA approval was removed
人们因为这些药物而死亡
because again people were dying
因为对心血管的影响
because of cardiovascular effects.
我不知道是不是也会让体温过高
I don't know if people were overheating on it as well.
那么解决方案是什么呢?
So what is the solution?
如果咖啡因是大多数人的切入点
If caffeine is the kind of the entry point for most people
使用化合物来提高减脂速率
of using compounds to increase the rate
或在运动甚至休息时减少脂肪
or percentage of fat loss in exercise and even at rest,
还有其他有用的东西吗
what are some of the other things that are useful
和有趣的吗?
and interesting?
从可操作的工具来看
Well, in terms of tools that are actionable
并有合理的安全边际
and have reasonable safety margins,
我之前讲过GLP-1
I've talked before about something called GLP-1.
这是可以被触发的
This is something that can be triggered
通过摄入马黛茶  一种茶
by the ingestion of yerba mate, which is a tea,
我想因为我有一半阿根廷血统
and I guess because I'm half Argentine,
我们是喝马黛茶长大的  伙计
we grew up drinking mate.
我想从那时起我就开始喝马黛茶了
I think I was drinking mate from the time
我当时大概三四岁
I was about three or four years old.
我不建议孩子们这样做
I don't suggest that for kids.
我觉得孩子们不应该摄入咖啡因
I don't think kids should be ingesting caffeine.
但不管怎样  我依然从小就开始喝马黛茶了
But anyway I did it and I still ingest mate.
马黛茶增加GLP-1
Mate increases GLP-1.
GLP-1是胰高血糖素通路
GLP-1 is in the glucagon pathway.
让我们快速回到我们的生物化学
So let's just quickly return to our biochemistry.
正如你们所记得的  脂肪是从体内脂肪储备中被调动的
As you recall, fat is mobilized from body fat stores
然后它就被消耗了
and then it's burned up.
它在细胞内被氧化
It's oxidized in cells.
它实际上需要转化成ATP
It actually needs to be converted into ATP.
这些脂肪酸基本上转化成了ATP
And those fatty acids are essentially converted into ATP
在细胞的线粒体中
in the mitochondria of the cell.
高胰岛素可以防止这种情况发生
High insulin prevents that from happening
胰高血糖素促进了这个过程
and glucagon facilitates that process.
胰高血糖素促进了这一过程
Glucagon facilitates that process
通过增加GLP-1
through increases in GLP-1.
简单地说  马黛茶会增加GLP-1
The short takeaway is mate increases GLP-1
是的  它会增加你燃烧的脂肪比例
and yes, increases the percentage of fat that you will burn.
它会增加脂肪燃烧
It increases fat burning.
这尤其正确
And that is especially true,
从科学文献来看
it turns out from the scientific literature,
如果你在任何形式的运动前摄入马黛茶
if you ingest mate prior to exercise of any kind.
所以  如果你想燃烧更多的脂肪
So if you want to burn more fat drinking mate
锻炼前喝马黛茶是好的
before exercise is good.
当你不运动的时候  在休息的时候喝
Drinking it at rest when you're not exercising
也会改变你的新陈代谢
will also help shift your metabolism
通过增加脂肪氧化来促进脂肪燃烧
toward enhanced burning of fat by increasing fat oxidation.
那么  有一个完整的药品类别
Now, there's a whole category of pharmaceuticals
现在正在开发中
that's being developed right now
现在处于后期试验阶段
that are in late stage trials
或者用于治疗糖尿病
or are in use for the treatment of diabetes
利用GLP-1通路
which capitalize on this GLP-1 pathway.
它们有不同的名字
They go by various names
网上有很多人
and there are people on the internet
在卖这些东西
who are selling these things.
它们是处方药
They are prescription drugs
我想强调的是  它们是处方药
and I want to emphasize that they are prescription drugs
你显然不想用
and you obviously wouldn't want to use
没有处方和要求的这些药
any of these without a prescription and a requirement.
它们似乎确实有效
It does seem that they are effective
用于治疗某些类型的糖尿病
for the treatment of certain kinds of diabetes
并能显著减轻体重
and lead to fairly significant weight loss
食欲减退
and reduction in appetite.
这是GLP-1的现代版本
So this is kind of the modern version of GLP-1
GLP-1代谢药物
is pharmaceuticals of GLP-1 metabolism
是药物  如...
are drugs such as somatical,
我永远不会发这个音
I can never pronounce this.
我好像很多东西都不会发音
I can't seem to pronounce many things it seems.
我叫它Semaglutide
Semaglutide is the way I would pronounce it.
S-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E
S-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E.
Semaglutide  但不是这个发音
Semaglutide but that's not the way you pronounce it.
但Semaglutide是这样描述的
But Semaglutide is the way that it's been described
在互联网上
on the internet.
在任何情况下  这种化合物都会增加GLP-1
In any case, this compound increases GLP-1.
在某些情况下  它实际上是GLP-1的类似物
It's actually a GLP-1 analog in some cases,
它们有各种各样的商品名称
and they go by various types of trade names.
所以GLP-1途径很有趣
So the GLP-1 pathway is interesting.
大多数人  包括我自己
Most people, including myself,
对服用处方药不感兴趣
are not interested in taking a prescription drug
增加GLP-1,
to increase GLP-1,
我通过喝马黛茶来做到这一点
I do it through the ingestion of mate.
我只需要把马黛茶叶倒在上面  然后把它喝了
I just get the mate leaves, pour water over it and drink it.
有趣的是
What's kind of interesting,
这并不常被讨论
that's not often discussed
你可以增加GLP-1的量
is that you can increase the amount of GLP-1 by,
你可以重复使用这些茶
you can essentially reuse the tea.
第一次喝的时候会非常非常浓
The first time you drink it it can be very, very intense.
事实上  有些人觉得马黛茶
And in fact, some people find that mate
尝起来几乎像烧焦的叶子
almost tastes like burnt leaves.
太浓了
It's too intense.
你不希望水太热
You don't want the water to be too hot.
但这是我从一个朋友那里学来的
But I learned this trick from a friend.
你可以反复使用这些叶子
You can reuse the leaves over and over again,
大概一整天
probably for about a day before they go bad.
在这样做的过程中  你开始从马黛茶中提取越来越多的东西
And in doing that, you start to extract more and more
增加GLP-1的化合物
of the compounds from the mate leaf that increased GLP-1.
这很酷
So it's kind of cool.
你可以获得更大的效果
You can kind of get an increased effect.
我通常会做16到30盎司
So what I'll typically do is make a about 16 to 30 ounces
每天都要喝一小口
and just sip it throughout the day,
我在训练前确实很喜欢
and I do like it before I train.
有些人不喜欢马黛茶
Some people who don't like mate
可能更喜欢像guayusa这样的东西
might prefer something like guayusa,
G-U-A-Y-U-S-A
which is spelled G-U-A-Y-U-S-A.
G-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa来自厄瓜多尔
G-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa which is from Ecuador,
尽管它名字以USA结尾
despite the USA ending to it.
它来自厄瓜多尔
It's from Ecuador.
这种茶的味道更甜
And it's a sweeter tasting tea.
里面没有任何甜味剂
It doesn't have any sweetener in it,
但是guayusa的叶子更甜
but the leaf of the guayusa plant is sweeter
比马黛茶叶更甜
than the mate plant.
我有时会把这两者混在一起
I sometimes will mix the two
然后用它来泡茶
and then make the tea with that.
播客没有马黛茶 瓜尤萨的赞助商
There's no mate or guayusa sponsor of the podcast.
这些只是增加GLP-1和脂肪氧化的工具
These are just tools to increase GLP-1 and fat oxidation.
Semaglutide是处方药
And again, the Semaglutide is the prescription version
这是一种强力GLP-1兴奋剂
of the that's kind of the heavy artillery GLP-1 stimulant,
这也只能通过处方来使用
and again should be only explored with a prescription.
这些就是化合物
So those are the compounds
直接增加了脂肪的氧化
that really increase fat oxidation directly.
影响胰岛素的因素有很多
There are going to be a number of things that impact insulin
胰高血糖素会改变身体
and glucagon that are going to shift the body
让更多的脂肪燃烧
toward more fat burning.
我们在之前讲了很多
We talked about a lot of these during the episode
关于荷尔蒙的
on hormones.
我们谈过了
We talked about it.
我们做了一整集关于荷尔蒙和新陈代谢的播客
We did a whole episode on hormones and metabolism.
比如  小檗碱
And so for instance, berberine,
一种来自植物或二甲双胍的化合物
which comes from a plant or metformin are compounds
现在越来越多的人在使用
that are now in kind of growing use
来降低血糖
for reducing blood glucose.
它们在降低血糖方面非常有效
They are very potent at reducing blood glucose,
从而会降低胰岛素
which will reduce insulin because the job
胰岛素的主要作用是控制葡萄糖
of the hormone insulin is to essentially manage glucose
在血液中
in the bloodstream.
所以有一个巨大的化合物集合
So there are a huge gallery of compounds
这会降低胰岛素
that will reduce insulin
从而增加脂肪氧化
and thereby can increase fat oxidation.
这是因为  正如我之前提到的
And that's because, as I mentioned before,
脂肪氧化  这是脂肪酸转化为ATP的过程
fat oxidation, this conversion of fatty acids into ATP
在线粒体中的这个过程   被胰岛素抑制
in the mitochondria is inhibited by insulin.
所以如果你保持低胰岛素水平
So if you keep insulin low,
你会增加这个过程
you're going to increase that process.
我们又回到了原点
Which brings us full circle back
关于饮食和营养的问题
to the issue of diet and nutrition.
斯坦福大学的加德纳实验室有确凿的证据
There is really solid evidence from the Gardner Lab
和其他实验室的研究表明
at Stanford and from other labs showing that,
当你观察不同的饮食时
when you look at different diets,
看看低脂饮食
you look at low fat diets,
高脂肪饮食,
high fat diets,
生酮饮食  间歇性禁食
keto diets, intermittent fasting,
只要人们坚持自己的饮食习惯
provided people stick to their particular diet,
你遵循哪种饮食习惯并不重要
it doesn't really matter which diet you follow.
你仍然会出现热量不足
You can still get a caloric deficit
你的体重减轻了
and you get weight loss.
然而  坚持始终是一个问题
Adherence however is always an issue.
所以我总是说
And so what I always say is,
你要使用的饮食计划
that you want to use the eating plan
显然要对你的健康有好处
that is obviously beneficial to your health,
是要能让你坚持下去的饮食计划
but the one that allows you to adhere
不管具体的营养方案是什么
to whatever it is that the particular nutrition protocol is,
对吧?
right?
如果你不能坚持做某件事
If you can't stick with something,
那就不值得了
then it's not very worthwhile.
但从纯科学的角度来看
But from the purely scientific standpoint,
保持低胰岛素水平也有好处
there's also an advantage to keeping insulin low.
这并不一定意味着
Now, that doesn't necessarily mean
碳水化合物为零
you go to zero carbohydrate.
我之前讲过我喜欢的饮食方式
I've talked before about my preferred way of eating
白天中摄入低碳水化合物  或者不摄入碳水化合物
is to go lower or no carbohydrates throughout the day
保持警觉  释放肾上腺素  集中注意力
for alertness to get that adrenaline release and the focus
所有这些  等等
that goes with it, et cetera,
以及思考和行动的能力
and the ability to think and move
在白天做我需要做的所有事情
and do all the things I need to do during the day.
然后我晚上吃碳水化合物
And then I eat carbohydrates at night
因为它有助于睡眠
'cause it facilitates the transition to sleep.
这对我很有效
That's what works for me.
但当胰岛素水平低时
But when insulin is low,
你确实让你的身体系统处于一个可以氧化更多脂肪的位置
you do place your system in a position to oxidize more fat.
这就是为什么我认为很多人确实看到了好处
And so that's why I think a lot of people do see benefit
低碳水化合物或中度碳水化合物饮食
from lower carbohydrate or moderate carbohydrate diets,
因为当胰岛素水平低时
because when insulin is low,
你可以氧化更多的脂肪
you are in a position to oxidize more fat.
无论是在运动还是休息时
Both from exercise and at rest.
我应该提一下  因为我经常提到
And I should mention, because I often mention
提到它是恰当的
and it's appropriate to mention
如果你对效果感兴趣的话
that if you're interested in looking at the effects
咖啡因  马黛茶, guayusa之类的东西
of caffeine, of mate, guayusa things of that sort,
GLP-1  你想了解更多
GLP-1 you want to learn more about those.
你可以去这个很棒的网站
You can go to this wonderful website
这是免费的www.examine.com
which is free www.examine.com.
你可以输入  马黛茶
You can put in yerba mate,
它将查出这三个研究
it will describe the three studies
都显示出  在运动和休息时
that show increased fat oxidation,
增加了脂肪氧化
both during exercise and at rest,
其结果并不奇怪  而且还能增加
and as a consequence not surprisingly and increase
代谢率
in metabolic rate.
马黛茶有一个有趣的地方
One thing that's interesting about mate
它会导致心率轻微下降
is it causes a slight decrease in heart rate
原因我还是不知道
for reasons that still escape me.
有一项研究表明
There's a single study showing
心率略有降低
that heart rate is slightly reduced
这很好  因为如果
which is kind of nice because if,
当我喝了太多的咖啡因
when I drink too much caffeine
我的心跳加速
my heart rate goes up,
也许这会增加我的细微动作和脂肪燃烧
maybe that would increase my fidgeting and my fat burning,
但我不喜欢我的基础心率
but I don't like the feeling of having my basal heart rate
太高了
being up too high.
我喜欢在运动时心率提高
I like my heart rate elevate during exercise,
但不是在我休息的时候
but not when I'm just kind of resting
或者整天工作
or working and throughout the day.
出于某种我不明白的原因
And for some reason that I don't understand
马黛茶既能够增加脂肪氧化的效果
there's an effect of mate of increasing fat oxidation
又能稍微降低心率
but reducing heart rate just slightly.
这是有趣的
So that's interesting.
这些可能会
And it probably lends itself [indistinct]
解释了主观经验
explains the subjective experience
我对他的感觉有点好
that I've had of that mate has kind of a little nice
甚至成熟的兴奋剂
even mellow stimulant.
它不是像咖啡因那样的超级兴奋剂
It's not this really supercharged stimulant like caffeine
从咖啡或其他来源
from coffee or other sources.
不过如果你喝多了马黛茶 
Although if you drink too much mate
这也会让你紧张不安
it will also make you jittery.
还有一种化合物我认为我们应该讨论一下
And there's one more compound that I think we should discuss
在减脂方面
in terms of increasing fat loss,
这就是肉碱或乙酰肉碱
and that's carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine,
它们在同一条路径上
they lie in the same pathway.
我们现在可以回到基本的脂肪动员知识上来
We can return to our basic knowledge now of fat mobilization
和氧化
and oxidation.
在脂肪被调动并使其进入细胞之后
After fat is mobilized and makes it into cells
需要被氧化
and needs to be oxidized.
也就是脂肪的燃烧
So the literally the burning of fat
并将其转化为能量
and conversion of it into energy
这是完成和促进的
that is accomplished and is facilitated
胰高血糖素升高
by the presence of glucagon being elevated,
GLP增加了这一过程  导致胰岛素水平降低
GLP increases that process and insulin being low.
我们讲了一些管理胰岛素的方法
And we talked about some ways to manage insulin
这一集和上一集都有
both in this episode and in previous episode.
左卡尼汀和乙醯左旋肉碱
L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine
尤其有利于脂肪的氧化
in particular facilitates fat oxidation.
它有助于将脂肪酸转化为ATP
It helps convert fatty acids into ATP.
事实上  补充左旋肉碱可以增加脂肪的减少
And indeed supplementing L-carnitine can increase fat loss.
这是被证明
That's been shown.
什么剂量?
At what dosages?
人们从任何地方摄取500毫克
Well, people ingest anywhere from 500 milligrams
每天两克  通常是分剂量服用
to two grams per day in divided doses typically.
有些人真的很极端
Some people who are really extreme
会注射左旋肉碱
are taking injectable L-carnitine,
我当然没试过
I've certainly not tried that.
我承认我经常用的是药片的形式
I confess I have used it in pill form from time to time
但在某种程度上  由于脂肪的氧化作用
but in part, because of the fat oxidation effects,
还因为它可能产生的其他影响
but also because of the other effects that it tends to have.
所以在探索乙酰左旋肉碱的作用时
So in exploring the effects that acetyl-L-carnitine has,
它对细胞的新陈代谢有各种各样的影响
it has a huge variety of effects on cellar metabolism.
它可以减少血液中的氨
It can reduce ammonia in the blood
这实际上是一个相当强的影响
that is actually a quite strong effect.
它可以减少c反应蛋白
It can reduce things like C-reactive protein,
c反应蛋白水平
which is you want to C-reactive protein levels
最好在一定范围内
to be managed.
你不希望它们太高
You do not want them too high.
可轻微降低血糖
Can slightly reduce blood glucose.
我可以稍微增加HDLC
I can slightly increase HDLC,
血脂的良好状态
the good form of the blood lipid
并稍微降低整体胆固醇
and slightly reduce overall cholesterol.
正如我提到的  它可以稍微调整
And as I mentioned, it can slightly modify
胰高血糖素的通路
the pathway involving glucagon,
这样你就能得到相当大的效果
such that you get a considerable effect,
对脂肪氧化的影响不大
not a huge effect on fat oxidation,
所以它可以提高脂肪的氧化速率
so it can improve pat oxidation rates.
它还有其他一些影响
It has a number of other effects,
其中一些我在谈荷尔蒙的那个月讲到过
some of which I talked during the month on hormones
诸如此类的事情
and that sort of thing.
它对怀孕率有很大的影响
It has strong effects on rates of pregnancy
和精子质量
and sperm quality.
显然肉碱有很多作用
So clearly carnitine is doing lots of different things
作用于很多不同的细胞
and lots of different cells.
它影响了精子的活力
It's impacting sperm motility.
大量的研究都支持这一观点
They're in a large number of studies supporting that.
血压轻微下降
Slight reductions in blood pressure
对在运动中减少疲劳
and has these interesting effects on reducing fatigue
有挺有趣的效果
during exercise,
减少炎症标志物  如白细胞介素6
reducing inflammatory markers like interleukin 6.
所以总的来说  它有很多影响
So it has a number of effects that on the whole
是”正面“的  还是至少是正面的
are quote unquote positive or at least in the direction
是你可能想要的效果
of things that you may want.
我应该强调”可能“
And I should emphasize may.
你当然不需要乙酰左旋肉碱
You certainly don't need a acetyl-L-carnitine
为了减肥
in order to lose fat,
但既然你了解了细胞的过程
but now that you understand the cellular process
脂肪被调动和氧化
by which fat is mobilized and oxidized,
如果左旋肉碱
it should make sense that if L-carnitine
对将脂肪酸转化为能量很重要
is important for converting fatty acids into energy,
那么补充左旋肉碱就说得通了
then supplementing L-carnitine make sense.
乙酰左旋肉碱是左旋肉碱的一种
Acetyl-L-carnitine is the type of L-carnitine
或者说左旋肉碱的形式
or the form of L-carnitine I should say,
它最容易被身体运输和利用
that is transported and utilized most easily by the body.
这就是为什么有时我们会区分
And so that's why sometimes we distinguish
左旋肉碱和乙酰肉碱之间的关系
between L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine.
再一次  我们讲了大量的材料
So once again, we've covered an enormous amount of material.
我们已经讨论过减肥的科学
We've talked about the science of fat loss
特别是  我们已经
and in particular, we've explored this topic
从神经系统的角度来探讨了这个话题
from the perspective of the nervous system.
特别是神经元是如何释放物质的
How neurons and in particular the release of things
比如肾上腺素  肾上腺素也能促进脂肪动员
like adrenaline, epinephrin can facilitate fat mobilization
和氧化
and oxidation.
我们讲过NEAT 细微动作
We talked about NEAT, fidgeting,
这种非运动类型的运动
this non-exercise type movement
这样可以大大增加热量的燃烧
that can greatly increase caloric burn.
以及为什么会这样
And why that is.
我们谈到了颤抖
We talked about shiver,
这是另一种非运动形式
another form of non-exercise movement
这会增加卡路里的消耗
that can really increase both caloric expenditure
由于颤抖  由于运动
due to the shiver, due to the movement,
以及增加生热作用  使身体升温
as well as increase thermogenesis the heating up of the body
通过棕色脂肪
through things like brown fat,
甚至白色脂肪转化为棕色脂肪
and even the conversion of white fat to brown fat
如果你想氧化脂肪  这是件好事
which is a good thing if you want to oxidize fat.
我们说过寒冷是一种特殊的刺激
We talked about cold as a particular stimulus
使人颤抖  以及如何使用
to induce shiver and how to use getting into,
从寒冷中来回转换的方法来刺激颤抖
an out of cold as a way to stimulate shiver
避免冷适应  这样你才能继续
and avoid cold adaptation so that you continue
氧化和燃烧脂肪  如果这是你的目标的话
to oxidize and burn fat, if that's your goal.
如果你想看看治疗方案
If you want to check out the protocols for that,
在www.thecoldplunge.com
there at www.thecoldplunge.com
在接下来的几周  我们会增加
and in weeks to come we're going to be adding
更多的方案到那个网站
more protocols to that website
不仅仅是为了减肥
not just for fat loss,
但是对于韧性这样的东西
but for things like resilience,
减少炎症  等等
reducing inflammation, et cetera.
所以一定要去看看
So be sure to check those out again,
这些都是完全免费的
those are totally cost-free.
谈到运动
Talked about exercise.
不从心肺运动或者重量训练
How rather than thinking about cardiovascular
这个角度去考虑
or weight training exercise,
也许我们应该透过
that we should perhaps look through the lens
肾上腺素系统是如何相互作用在脂肪含量上去看
of this adrenaline system and how it interacts with fat stores 
低  中等
and think about low, medium
或者高强度运动
or high intensity exercise.
不管我们去不去禁食
Whether or not we show up to that fasted or not.
事实证明  禁食是有用的
Turns out showing up to that fasted can be useful,
如果你开始做高强度的运动
if you start with high intensity movements
然后进行低强度的运动
and then move into lower intensity type exercise.
如果你要持续很长时间
If you're going to go long duration,
这可能并不重要  除非你锻炼的时间更长
it probably doesn't matter unless you're exercising longer
超过90分钟  不管你吃不吃
than 90 minutes, whether or not you eat or not.
我们说过咖啡因是一种兴奋剂
We talked about caffeine as a stimulant
刺激肾上腺素的释放
and a stimulus for epinephrin and adrenaline release
作为一种促进脂肪代谢的方式
as a way to access more fat metabolism.
我们讨论过化合物
And we talked about compounds
来自马黛茶和guayusa茶
that come from things like yerba mate and guayusa tea,
这种GLP-1通路可以触发脂肪氧化增加
this GLP-1 pathway that can trigger increased fat oxidation
以至于制药公司
so much so that the pharmaceutical companies
现在正在开发专门的化合物
are now developing compounds specifically
增加GLP-1用于糖尿病和肥胖的治疗
to increase GLP-1 for treatment of diabetes and obesity.
但你依然可以利用GLP-1通路
But you can leverage the GLP-1 pathway
通过摄入像马黛茶这样的东西
through the ingestion of things like mate
如果你感兴趣的话  也可以去看看guayusa
or guayusa if that's of interest to you.
然后我们讨论了左旋肉碱
And then we talked about L-carnitine
以及左旋肉碱本身的重要性
and how L-carnitine itself is critical
用于单个细胞内的脂肪氧化
for the fat oxidation within individual cells.
脂肪酸转化为能量的过程
The conversion of fatty acids to energy.
以及为什么你的胰岛素水平低
And why having your insulin low
左旋肉碱和胰高血糖素水平
and things like L-carnitine and glucagon levels
高或充足  至少能方便你更好的燃烧脂肪
high or sufficient at least can facilitate the burning of fat,
氧化脂肪
 fat oxidation.
所以我们讲了很多材料
So we covered a lot of material.
我意识到有很多方案没有…
That's a lot of protocols I realize that didn't...
我刚才列的清单
The little list I just gave right there
还没开始讲细节呢
didn't even begin to get into all the details
很多小角落都没有触及到
and corners that we discussed.
我希望你觉得这次播客很有趣
I hope you found this conversation interesting
不管是为了理解脂肪的减少
both for sake of understanding fat loss
还是如何更快地减掉脂肪  减掉更多
and how to lose fat more quickly and to lose more of it,
如果这是你的目标的话
if that's your goal.
以及简单地理解生物学
As well as simply to understand the biology
从不同的角度研究脂肪代谢
of fat metabolism from a different perspective,
从神经系统的角度来看
from the perspective of the nervous system.
