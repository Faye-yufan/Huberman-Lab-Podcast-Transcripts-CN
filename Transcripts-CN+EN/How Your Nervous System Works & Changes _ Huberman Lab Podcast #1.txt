欢迎来到Huberman Lab
Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast
我们在这里讨论科学
where we discuss science
以及基于科学的日常工具
and science-based tools for everyday life
字幕翻译：Faye就是帆妹
我是Andrew Hueberman
I'm Andrew Hueberman and I'm a professor
是一名斯坦福医学院的神经生物学和眼科学教授
of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of Medicine
今天的播客 我们将讨论
for today's podcast we're going to talk
神经系统中的各个部分
about the parts list
这听起来看有点无聊
of the nervous system now that might sound boring
但这些微小的组织
but these are the bits and pieces that
一起组合成了
together make up
你人生中经历的一切
everything about your experience of life
从“你怎么想”到“你怎么感受”
from what you think about to what you feel
“你如何想象”  以及“你所成就的一切”
what you imagine and what you accomplish
从你出生的那一刻起
from the day you're born
直至你离开人世
until the day you die that parts list
这些零件组织真的很不可思议
is really incredible because it has a
因为它们有了一段很长的历史
history associated with it
为我们了解所有的事情
that really provides a window into all
提供了一个窗口
sorts of things like
比如  战争 宗教 哲学
engineering warfare religion and philosophy
所以我会与你们分享这些
so I'm going to share with you the parts list
塑造你们的神经组织
that makes up who you
带你们从生命的
are through the lens of some of those
各个角度
other aspects of life
从神经系统发展历史的
and other aspects of the history
各个方面  去了解你自己
of the discovery of the nervous system
在这个播客结束的时候
by the end of this podcast
我相信你会对
i promise you're gonna
自己的身体如何运作
understand a lot more about how you work
以及如何运用这些知识  有一定的了解
and how to apply that knowledge
我也会讲到一些故事
there's gonna be a little bit of story
会有很多的讨论
there's gonna be a lot of discussion
关于发现这些
about the people who
神奇现象的人
made these particular discoveries
会有一些专业术语
there'll be a little bit of technical
这没有办法避免
language there's no way to avoid that
但是最终  你学到的东西
but at the end you're gonna have in hand
相当于神经学和身体运作课程
what would be the equivalent of an entire semester of learning about
一整个学期的内容
the nervous system and how you work
所以在我们开始前  强调几个要点
so a few important points before we get started
首先  我不是医生
I am not a medical doctor
意味着  我不开任何处方
that means I don't prescribe anything
我是一名教授  所以有时候我会声明事实
i'm a professor so sometimes i'll profess things
我会声明很多事情
in fact I profess a lot of things
其次  我们会讲很多关于
we are going to talk about some basic
神经系统的基本功能  它的各部分等等
functioning of the nervous system parts and etc
之后我们也会讲到
but we're also going to talk about
如何去应用这些知识
how to apply that knowledge
话虽如此  你的身体
that said your health care your
你的健康  都是你自己的责任
well-being is your responsibility
所以在任何我们讨论工具的时候
so anytime we talk about tools
请记住你的责任
please filter it through that
并在使用前  与专业的医疗人员确认
responsibility talk to a healthcare professional
如果你想要尝试其他新的工具
if you're going to explore any new tools
或者新的练习
or practices and
请在使用前保持理智
be smart in your pursuit of these new tools
最后 我还想强调
I also want to emphasize that this
本播客  以及我在社交媒体上发布的其他内容
podcast and the other things i do on social media
都是我的个人目的
are my personal goal of bringing zero
为的是将零成本的消费信息
cost to consumer information
带给大众  这与本人
to the general public it is separate
在斯坦福大学所担任的职位无关
from my role at Stanford University
本着这种精神  非常感谢
In that spirit I really want to thank the
本次的赞助商
sponsors of today's podcast
（赞助商信息）
the first one is athletic greens which
（赞助商信息）
is an all-in-one
（赞助商信息）
drink it's a green string that has
vitamins minerals probiotics prebiotics
i've been using athletic green since 2012
so i'm really delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast the reason i like
it is because
i like vitamins and minerals i think
they're important to my health
and it can be kind of overwhelming to
know what to take
in that landscape so by taking one thing
that
also happens to taste really good i get
all the vitamins minerals etc that i
need
there's also a lot of data out there now
about the importance of the gut
microbiome for immune health and for
the gut brain access all these things
and
the probiotics and prebiotics are
important to me for that reason
if you want to try athletic greens you
can go to athleticgreens.com
huberman and put in the code word
huberman
at checkout if you do that they'll send
you a year supply of vitamin d3 and k2
there's a lot in the news lately about
the importance of vitamin d3 we can all
get vitamin d3 from sunlight but many of
us aren't getting enough sunlight
vitamin d3 has been shown to be relevant
to the immune system
and the hormone systems etc so once
again that's
athleticgreens.com huberman enter huber
minute checkout and you get the year
supply
of d3 and k2 along with your athletic
greens
this podcast is also brought to us by
inside tracker
which is a health monitoring company it
uses blood tests and saliva tests
to look at things like dna and metabolic
markers
and monitors your hormones a huge number
of different parameters of health
that really can only be measured
accurately through blood and saliva
tests
i use inside tracker because i'm a big
believer in data there's a lot of
aspects to our biology
that can only be accurately measured by
way of blood test and saliva test
the thing that's really nice about
inside tracker is that rather than just
giving you a bunch of numbers back
of the levels of these things in your in
your body it gives you through a really
simple platform
information about what to do with all
those
levels of hormones and metabolic markers
etc
it also has a feature which is
particularly interesting which it
measures your inner age which is
more a measure of your biological age as
opposed to your chronological age
and all that information is organized so
that you can make changes in your
nutritional regimes or your exercise
regimes and watch how those markers
change over time
so if you want to try inside tracker you
can go to insidetracker.com
huberman and they'll give you 25 off at
checkout
那我们来谈一谈神经系统
so let's talk about the nervous system
我用了“神经系统”这个词  而不用“大脑”
the reason i say your nervous system and not your brain
是因为你的大脑
is because your brain is actually just
实际上只是这更大系统中的一个小部分
one piece of this larger more important thing frankly
这个更大的系统就被我们称为“神经系统”
that we call the nervous system the
神经系统包括了你的大脑
nervous system includes your brain
以及你的脊髓  还包括了
and your spinal cord but also all the
大脑和脊髓间的所有连接
connections between your brain and your
还有你身体里的器官
spinal cord and the organs of your body
很重要的是  它还包括了
it also includes very importantly all
器官到大脑和脊髓之间的
the connections between
所有连接
your organs back to your spinal cord and brain
所以  想要明白你从出生
so the way to think about how you
到死亡之间的每一刻  身体是如何运作的
function at every level from the moment you're born
所有这些  你是如何
until the day you die everything you
思考  记忆  感受  想象
think and remember and feel and imagine
就先要理解  是神经系统在持续地传递循环
is that your nervous system is this continuous loop of communication
大脑-->脊髓-->身体
between the brain spinal cord and body
身体-->脊髓-->大脑
and body spinal cord and brain
事实上我们完全不能分开它们
in fact we really can't even separate
它们是连续的循环
them it's one continuous loop
你可能听过一个东西叫“莫比乌斯带”
you may have heard of something called a mobius strip
莫比乌斯带就如同
a mobius strip is almost
神经系统一般
like one of these impossible figures
不管从哪个角度
that no matter which
你都不能分辨出
angle you look at it from you can't tell
哪里开头  哪里结束
where it starts and where it ends
你的神经系统就如此般构造
and that's really how your nervous system is built
这种结构得以让你
that's the structure that allows you to
部署免疫细胞  来释放细胞
for instance deploy immune cells to release cells
在你受感染的情况下
that will go kill infection when
遏制感染
you're in the presence of infection
很多人都把这当成
most people just think about that
免疫系统的功能
as a function of the immune system
但事实上
but actually
是你的神经系统
it's your nervous system that tells
告诉你的器官  比如脾脏
organs like your spleen
去释放杀伤细胞  让它去抓住那些
to release killer cells that go and hunt down
细菌和病毒入侵者
those bacterial and viral invaders and
然后消灭它们
gobble them up
如果你感到胃痛
if you have a stomachache for instance
当然了 你的胃部确实有感觉
sure you feel that in your stomach
但实际上是神经系统
but it's really your nervous system
导致了你的胃痛
that's causing the stomach ache
痛感  是神经系统的一方面
the ache aspect of it is a nervous system feature
当我们想要谈论经历
so when we want to talk about experience
或者想要去改变我们自己
or we want to talk about how to change the self in any way
我们真的需要的  是先去思考神经系统如何工作
we really need to think about the nervous system first
可以这么说  神经系统掌管了身体的其他生理系统
it is fair to say that the nervous system governs all other biological systems of the body
同时也被其他的生理系统所影响
and it's also influenced by those other biological systems
所以当我们谈论神经系统的时候
so if we're talking about the nervous system
我们需要弄清楚我们在说什么
we need to get a little specific about what we mean
这不仅仅是一个大的循环连接
it's not just this big loop of wires
其实有一个有趣的故事
in fact there's a interesting story about that
在19世纪到20世纪间
because at the turn of the sort of 1800s to 1900s
大家都以为神经系统仅仅只是个巨大的单个细胞
it actually was believed that our nervous system was just one giant cell
但是有两个人
but two guys
名字其实没有那么重要
the names aren't super important but in
但是平心而论他们值得被记住
fairness to their important discovery
Ramone Cahal 一个西班牙人
Ramone Cahal a spaniard
和Camilo Golgi 一个意大利人
Camilo Golgi an italian guy figured out
他们解决了如何对神经系统进行标记或染色  然后发现了
how to label or stain the nervous system in a way that revealed
天啊  我们人体是由千百亿个小细胞组成
oh my goodness we're actually made up of trillions of these little cells
这些小细胞都是神经元
nerve cells that are called neurons and
这就是神经元  一个神经细胞
that's what a neuron is it's just a nerve cell
他们还看到了这些神经细胞并没有贴在一起
they also saw that those nerve cells weren't touching one another
而是中间有一些小缝隙
they're actually separated by little gaps and
那些小缝隙你们可能也听说过
those little gaps you may have heard of before
它们叫 突触
they're called synapses those synapses
在这些突触里 化学物质被一个神经元
are where the chemicals from one neuron
释放或吐出来
are kind of spit out or vomited into and
然后下一个神经元
then the next nerve cell
检测到了这种化学物质
detects those chemicals and then passes
沿着神经细胞产生电流
electricity down its length to the next
继续向前传递
nerve cell and so forth
所以可以把你的身体
so really the way to think about your
你的想法  你的思维
body and your thoughts and your mind
想作一段电流
is that you are a flow of electricity
没错  没什么好奇怪的
right there's nothing mystical about
你就是在不同的神经细胞之间
this you're a flow of electricity
产生的一段电流
between these different nerve cells
某一个神经细胞被激活的时候
and depending on which nerve cells are
你可能会举起你的手臂
active you might be lifting your arm or
或者放下手臂
lowering your arm
你可能会看到或者感受到某样红色的东西
you might be seeing something and perceiving that it's red
也有可能看到或感受到某样绿色的东西
or you might be seeing something and perceiving that it's green all depending
这都取决于一个神经细胞
on which nerve cells are electrically
在某个特定的时刻进行了有电活动
active at a given moment
感受红色和绿色
the example of perceiving red or
这是一个非常好的例子
perceiving green is a particularly good example
就好像  我们在这个世界的经历
because so often our experience of the world makes it seem as if
那些在我们身体之外发生的事情
these out these things that are happening outside us are actually
实际上发生在我们人体里面
happening inside us
神经系统的语言
but the language of the nervous system
就是电流
is just electricity
就好像是摩斯电码
it's just like a morse code of some sort
有一些音节  和单词
or the syllables or in words and
辅音和元音
consonants and vowels of language it
这取决于它们是如何组合起来的
just depends on how they're assembled
以何种顺序组合  于是这就把我们带到了
what order and so that brings us to the
神经系统是如何工作的这个问题上
the issue of how the nervous system
神经系统的工作方式
works the way to think about how the nervous system works
就好比我们的经历和记忆
is that our experiences our memories
一切都好像是钢琴上的琴键
everything is sort of like the keys on a piano
以特定的顺序被按下
being played in a particular order
如果我在一架钢琴上
right if i play the keys on a piano in a
以特定的顺序  特定的力度弹奏
particular order and with a particular intensity
那就会呈现出一首我们想要的曲子
that's a given song we could make that
这与我们经历的形成  异曲同工
analogous to a given experience
并不是说那些调子
it's not really that the key you know
比如升A调  降E调
A sharp or E-flat is
是歌曲本身  它们只是曲子的组成
the song it's just one component of the
所以当你听到什么的时候
song so when you hear
你知道 比如说
that you know for instance uh there's a
有一个大脑区域叫做海马体
brain area called the hippocampus which
它参与了记忆
there is that's involved in memory well it it's
它的确参与了记忆
involved in memory but it's not that
但并不是说记忆(比如 听到的话)被储存在那里
memories are stored there as you know sentences
它们是以电流和神经元的模式被储存
they're stored there as patterns of electricity and neurons
当这个行为重复的时候
that when repeated
会给你一种
give you the sense that you're
再次经历一遍的感觉
experiencing the thing again
事实上  “似曾相识”这种感觉
in fact deja vu the sense that what
这种当你经历某件事时  感觉到是如此的熟悉
you're experiencing is so familiar and like something that
就好像曾经经历过一般
you've experienced previously
其实仅仅只是  在一种情况下活跃的神经元
is merely that the neurons that were active in one circumstance are now
现在又在同样的情况下变得活跃了
becoming active in the same circumstance again and so
就像听同一首歌
it's really just like hearing the same song
也许不是在弹钢琴 而是
maybe uh not played on a piano but
下次用古典吉他
next time on a classical guitar
那首歌有些相似
there's something similar about that song
即使在两种不同的乐器上演奏
even though it's being played on two different instruments
所以我认为很重要的是人们要
so i think it's important that people
了解他们神经系统的各个部分
understand the parts of their nervous system
而且它不仅包括大脑
and that it includes so much more than just the brain
而且有神经元和突触这些东西 但实际上
and that there are these things neurons and synapses but really
这些神经元的电活动决定了
that it's the electrical activity of these neurons that dictates
我们的经验 如果1900年代初
our experience so if the early 1900s
当这些神经元被发现时
were when these neurons were discovered
从那以后肯定发生了很多事
certainly a lot has happened since then
从1900年代初期到现在
and in that time between the early 1900s and now
历史上确实发生了一些重要的事件
there's some important events that actually happened in history
给我们洞察力 或使我们洞悉神经系统如何工作
that give us insight or gave us insight into how the nervous system works
真正令人惊讶的之一是战争
one of the more surprising ones was actually warfare
所以大多数人都知道  在战争中
so as most everybody knows in warfare
人们会被子弹打中  经常有人死亡 但是
people get shot and people often die but
很多人被打中  但是不会死
many people get shot and they don't die
在第一次世界大战中 子弹的火炮发生了一些变化 
and in World War One there were some changes in artillery in bullets that
改变了子弹  让它会
made for a situation where bullets would
在非常分散的位置进入身体和大脑
enter the body and brain at very discrete locations
会从另一边出来
and would go out the other side of the
身体或大脑 并在该出口位置开一个很小的孔
body or brain and also make a very small hole at that exit location
这样做
and in doing so
产生了许多自然发生的神经系统病变
produced a lot of naturally occurring lesions of the nervous system
现在你说很好 那与神经科学有什么关系
now you say okay well how does that relate to neuroscience well
不像之前那样  被子弹打中后
unlike previous years where a lot of the artillery would create
大脑或身体会出现一个大洞
these big sort of holes as the bullets would would blow out of the brain or body
我知道这很可怕
i know this is rather gruesome
当子弹击落点非常分散时
when the holes were very discreet they
在某一点进入而在另一点离开
entered at one point and left at another point
它们会带出或摧毁
they would take out or destroy very
不同的神经系统的神经组织
discreet bits of neural tissue of the nervous system
所以人们从战争中回来时脑袋上有枪口伤疤
so people were coming back from war with holes in their brain
或者在神经系统其他部位的特定位置
and in other parts of their nervous system that were limited to very specific locations
除此之外 还有一些
in addition to that there was some
清洁伤口的技术也有所发展
advancement in the cleaning of wounds that happened so
所以更多的人幸存了下来 这意味着
many more people were surviving what this meant was that
神经科医生会有一些士兵病人
neurologists now had a collection of patients
回来之后 他们大脑的特定位置
that would come back and they'd have holes in very
会有伤疤 他们会说类似
specific locations of their brain and they'd say things like
恩 我可以认出人脸
well i can recognize faces
但我不知道那些面孔是谁的
but i can't recognize who those faces belong to
我知道这是一张脸 但我不知道它属于谁
I know it's a face but I don't know who it belongs to
在那个人最终死后
and after that person eventually died
神经科医生会弄清楚
the neurologist would figure out ah
我已经有十位病人告诉我
i've had 10 patients that all told me
他们都无法认出人脸 
that they couldn't recognize faces and
他们都有这些弹孔
they all had these bullet holes that
穿过大脑的某个特定区域
went through a particular region of the brain
这就是我们如何很多的了解
and that's how we know a lot about how
特定大脑区域的功能 例如海马体
particular brain regions like the hippocampus work
实际上 一些更惊人的例子
in fact some of the more amazing examples of this
打完仗的士兵回来之后 他们
where people would come back and they
可能会完全胡言乱语
for instance would speak in complete gibberish
他们原本可以正常说话
they'd whereas previously they could speak normally
即使他们在完全的胡言乱语
and even though they were speaking in
他们能理解别人说的话
complete gibberish they could understand
就是我们所知道的
language perfectly that's how we know
说话和语言理解实际上是由
that speech and language are actually controlled by separate
不同的神经系统区域所控制
portions of the nervous system and there
有很多这样的例子
are many examples like that
无法认出名人面孔的人
people that couldn't recognize the faces of famous people
这给我们带来了很多
or and that actually brings us to an
现代的有趣的例子
interesting example in modern times
许多年后的21世纪初
many many years later in the early 2000s
实际上有一篇论文
there was actually a paper
在自然杂志上发表
that was published in the journal nature
很好的一本杂志 那篇论文指出 
excellent journal showing that in
一个完全健康的人
a human being a perfectly healthy human being
只有当该人查看了女演员詹妮弗·安妮斯顿的照片时
there was a neuron that would become active electrically active
有一个特定的神经元会产生电信号
only when the person viewed the picture of Jennifer Aniston the actress
所以真的 有一个代表詹妮弗·安妮斯顿（Jennifer Aniston）的神经元
so literally a neuron that represented Jennifer Aniston so-called Jennifer Aniston cells
神经科学家才知道这些珍妮弗·安妮斯顿细胞
neuroscientists know about these jennifer aniston cells
如果你能认出詹妮弗·安妮斯顿的脸
if you can recognize Jennifer Aniston's face you have
你就有珍妮弗·安妮斯顿神经元
Jennifer Aniston neurons and presumably
同时你也有可以识别
you also have neurons that can recognize
其他名人和非名人的面孔的神经元
the faces of other famous and non-famous people so that
表明我们的大脑确实是我们经验的映射
indicates that our brain is really a map of our experience
我们来到世界  我们的大脑
our we come into the world and our brain
对学习特定事物有一种偏见
has a kind of bias towards learning particular kinds of things
它准备接收信息并
it's ready to receive information and
了解该信息
learn that information
但是大脑真的是经验的映射
but the brain is really a map of experience
所以我们来谈谈什么是经验
so let's talk about what experience
你的大脑运作良好意味着什么
really is what does it mean for your brain to work well
我认为可以说神经系统
I think it's fair to say that the nervous system
会做五件事 也许六件事 第一件事就是感觉
really does five things maybe six the first one is sensation
因此 了解这一点很重要
so this is important to understand for
你们所有人都想改变
any and all of you that want to change
 你的神经系统或将工具应用于
your nervous system or to apply tools to
使 你的神经系统更好地工作
make your nervous system work better
感觉是神经系统不可协商的要素
sensation is a non-negotiable element of your nervous system
你的眼睛里有神经元
you have neurons in your eye that
感知某些颜色的光
perceive certain colors of light
和某些运动方向
and certain directions of movement
你的皮肤里有神经元
you have neurons in your skin
感觉到特殊的触摸
that perceive particular kinds of touch
轻触 或重一些的触摸 或让人痛苦的触摸
like light touch or firm touch or painful touch
你的耳朵中有神经元 可以感知某些声音
you have neurons in your ears that perceive certain sounds
 你的整个人生经历是
your entire experience of life is
被我们所谓的“受体”过滤
filtered by these what we call sensory receptors
就叫这个名字
if you want to know what the name is
所以这总是提出一个有趣的问题 人们经常问
so this always raises an interesting question people ask well
世界上有没有更多
is there much more out there is there a lot more happening in the world
我自己  甚至全人类都没有经历过的事情发生？
that i'm not experiencing or that humans aren't experiencing
当然答案是肯定的
and the answer of course is yes there
这个星球上有很多物种  它们感知世界的方式
are many species on this planet that are perceiving things
是除了科技 人类永远无法感知的到的
that we will never perceive unless we apply technology
我能想到的最好的例子
the best example i could think of off
第一个就是红外视线
the top of my head would be something like infrared vision
蛇 蝮蛇 等等
there are snakes out there pit vipers and so forth
可以感应到其他物体散发出来的热量
that can sense heat emissions from other
他们实际上看不见动物的形状
animals they don't actually see their shape
他们感觉到自己的热量形态和热量散发
they sense their heat shape and their heat emissions
人类当然不能那样做
humans can't do that unless of course
除非他们戴上红外线护目镜
they put on infrared goggles or
或者用一些
something that would allow them to
检测那些热量散发的技术
detect those heat emissions
再举一个例子  海龟和某些
there are turtles and certain species of
远距离迁徙的鸟类
birds that migrate long distances
可以检测到磁场 因为它们具有神经元
that can detect magnetic fields because they have neurons
是的 又是神经系统
again it's the nervous system that
让它们有这种能力
allows them to do this
所以它们的鼻子和头上都有神经元
so they have neurons in their nose and in their head
让它们能够沿着磁场迁移
that allow them to migrate along magnetic fields in order to
没错  听起来很神奇
as amazing as this sounds go from one
它们会找到海洋中的特定位置
particular location in the ocean
在千里之外
thousands of miles away to all aggregate
在一年中的特定时间在一个特定的海滩上 以便他们可以交配
on one particular beach at a particular time of year so that they can mate
产卵 然后游回海中死亡
lay eggs and then wander back off into the sea to die
然后年轻海龟会去
and then their young will eventually
孵出那些可爱的小海龟
hatch those little cute little turtles will shuffle to the
然后又游走 去做完全相同的事情
ocean swim off and go do the exact same thing they
它们不会凭肉眼视力去找迁徙路径
don't do migrate that distance by vision
也不会闻气味找路
they don't do it by smell
他们通过感应磁场来做到这一点
they do it by sensing magnetic fields
好吧 还有许多其他物种做这些我们无法做到的不可思议的事情
okay and many other species do these incredible things we don't
人类可没有感应磁性的器官
humans are not magnetic sensing
我们做不到 因为我们
organisms we can't do that because we
没有感应磁场的受体
don't have receptors that sense magnetic fields
有数据显示 也许有人可以感应到磁场
there's some data that maybe some humans can sense magnetic fields
但是当有人确切的说自己可以感应磁场
but you should be very skeptical of
不管以何种准确性和稳定性
anyone that's convinced that they can do
你都要保持怀疑的态度
that with any degree of robustness or accuracy because even the
因为真的能够感受到的人 他们自己都不一定知道
people that can do this aren't necessarily aware that they can
也许之后播客会讲到这个话题
maybe a topic for a future podcast
所以我们先有感觉 然后才有感知
so we have sensation then we have perception
感知 是我们接收感觉的能力
perception is our ability to take what we're sensing
并专注于此 并使其有意义 以进行探索 以记住它
and focus on it and make sense of it to explore it to remember it
因此 感知就是
so really perceptions are just whichever
我们碰巧注意到的感觉
sensations we happen to be paying attention to
在任何时候 你都可以做到
at any moment and you can do this right
即便现在 你可以体验感知
now you can experience perception and
也可以体验知觉和感觉之间的区别
the difference between perception
非常容易 例如 如果我告诉你
and sensation very easily if for instance i tell you
注意脚接触的东西
to pay attention to the contact of your feet
脚底碰到的任何表面
the bottoms of your feet with whatever surface they happen to be in contact with
也许是鞋子 也许是地板 也许是空气
maybe it's shoes maybe it's the floor if your feet are up maybe it's air
当 你放置 所谓的“关注焦点”
the moment you place your what we call the spotlight of attention
或“感知焦点”
or the spotlight of perception
在你的脚上的时候 你就能感知
on your feet you are now perceiving what
那里的情况
was happening there what was being sensed there
感觉一直在发生
the sensation was happening all along however
所以感觉是不可以被改变的
so while sensation is not negotiable
你不能改变你的受体 
you can't change your receptors unless
除非你采用了一些新技术 但感知由你控制
you adopt some new technology perception is under the control of your attention
对感知的描述就如同
and the way to think about attention
是聚光灯 但不仅仅只是一个聚光灯
is it's like a spotlight except it's not one spotlight
你实际上有两个关注的焦点
you actually have two attentional spotlights 
任何告诉你 
anyone that tells you
不能同时做多件事的人  告诉他们那是错的
you can't multitask tell them they're wrong
如果他们不同意 请告诉他们与我联系
and if they disagree with you tell them to contact me
因为在旧世界中人类是灵长类动物
because in old world primates of which humans are
我们能够做所谓的秘密注意
we are able to do what's called covert attention
我们可以把重点放在各种东西上
we can place a spotlight of
例如注意某事
attention on something for instance
正在阅读或看的东西
something we're reading or looking at
或我们正在听的人
or someone that we're listening to and
我们可以将第二个关注点放在
we can place a second spotlight of attention on
我们正在吃的东西以及它的味道
something we're eating and how it tastes
或在房间里跑来跑去的孩子  或我的狗
or our child running around in the room or my dog
 你可以将注意力分为两部分
you can split your attention into two
但当然 你也可以把你的注意放一起
locations but of course you can also bring your attention
那就是你对一个特定事物的感知
that is your perception to one particular location
你可以扩大注意力
you can dilate your attention kind of
就像使聚光灯更加分散
like making a spotlight more diffuse
或者 你可以使其更加集中
or you can make it more concentrated
这对了解 你是否要去使用
this is very important to understand if you're going
改善神经系统的工具非常重要
to think about tools to improve your nervous system
不管这个工具是
whether or not that tool is in the form of
什么化学药品
a chemical that you decide to take
或者是什么补剂可以增加
maybe a supplement to increase some chemical
大脑中某种物质的分泌 只要你决定好了
in your brain if that's your choice or
或者是某种脑电设备 或者你要尝试
a brain machine device or you're going to try 
在某一段时间内 每天通过集中精力或积极性 
and learn something better by engaging in some focus or motivated
来更好地学习
pursuit for some period of time each day 
注意力绝对是
attention is something that is
在你控制之下的一个东西 尤其是当 你休息时
absolutely under your control in particular when you're rested
我们会回到这一点 当你休息时
and we'll get back to this but when you are rested
我们之后会很明确地定义休息
and will define rest very clearly
你可以通过非常有意识的方式来引导 你的注意力
you are able to direct your attention in very deliberate ways
那是因为我们神经系统中有某种东西
and that's because we have something in our nervous system which is sort of
就像一条双向路
like a two-way street
那条双向路是
and that two-way street is a communication
将我们神经系统中各个反射部分
between the aspects of our nervous system that are reflexive and
和有意识的部分 连接了起来
the aspects of our nervous system that are deliberate
我们都知道反射在生活中是什么感觉
so we all know what it's like to be reflexive
如果 你已经知道如何走路 
you go through life you're walking if you already know how to walk ==
那么你不会去想该怎么走路
you don't think about your walking you just walk
那是因为神经系统希望
and that's because the nervous system wants to pass off
尽可能多地通过反射运动
as much as it can to reflexive action
这就是所谓的“自下而上”的处理
that's called bottom-up processing it
这只是意味着信息正在通过 你的感官流入
really just means that information is flowing in through your senses
不管你在感知什么
regardless of what you're perceiving
信息在流动 它正在指导 你的活动
that information is flowing up and it's directing your activity
但是在任何时候
but at any moment for instance let's say
比如  拐角处一辆汽车在你面前疾驶 然后你突然间停下来
a car screeches in front of you around the corner and you suddenly pause
你现在正切换到刻意行为
you are now moving into deliberate
 你将以非常刻意的方式环顾四周的动作
action you would start looking around in a very deliberate way
神经系统可以反射行为
the nervous system can be reflexive in
也可以是刻意行为
its action or it can be deliberate
如果反射行为倾向于“自下而上”的话
if reflexive action tends to be what we call bottom up
刻意的行动 刻意的看法和刻意的思想是
deliberate action and deliberate perceptions and deliberate thoughts are
属于 “自上而下” 他们需要一些努力和专注
top-down they require some effort and some focus
但这就是 你可以决定
but that's the point you can decide to
将注意力和精力集中在
focus your attention and energy on
 你想要决定的任何事情
anything you want you can decide to
以 你想要的任何方式  集中你的行为
focus your behavior in any way you want
但总会感觉到它需要
but it will always feel like it requires
一些努力和压力
some effort and some strain whereas when
而当你在反射模式下的时候 走路
you're in reflexive mode just walking
聊天 吃饭 做自己的事情
and talking and eating and doing your thing
都会非常简单轻松
it's going to feel very easy and that's
因为你的神经系统基本上已经连接了
because your nervous system basically wired up
能够轻松完成大多数事情
to be able to do most things easily
没有太多的新陈代谢需求
without much metabolic demand without consuming
不消耗精力 但是当 你尝试
much energy but the moment you try and
做一些非常具体的事情
do something very specific
这会让你感到精神上的阻力
it's going to you're going to feel a sort of mental friction
这将是具有挑战性的 所以我们有感觉
it's going to be challenging so we've got sensations perceptions
然后我们得到了我们称之为“感受”
and then we've got things that we call feelings slash
或者叫“情绪”的东西  这变得有点复杂 因为
emotions and these get a little complicated because
几乎所有人 我希望我们所有人
almost all of us i would hope all of us
熟悉诸如幸福  悲伤 无聊或沮丧之类的情绪
are familiar with things like happiness and sadness or boredom or frustration
科学家疯狂的争论  神经科学家 心理学家 还有哲学家
scientists argue like crazy neuroscientists and psychologists and
都对此事争论不休  它们(情绪)到底是什么
philosophers for that matter argue like crazy about what these are
以及它们的机制 当然情绪和感受
and how they work certainly emotions and
是神经系统的产物
feelings are the product of the nervous system
它们涉及神经元的活动 但
they involve the activity of neurons but
正如我前面提到的 神经元具有电活性 
as i mentioned earlier neurons are electrically active ==
但他们也释放化学物质
but they also release
 并且有一类化学物质
chemicals and there's a certain category of chemicals
对我们的情绪状态有非常深远的影响
that has a very profound influence on our emotional states
他们被称为神经调节剂
they're called neuromodulators 
这些神经调节剂的名称可能是 你以前听说过的
and those neuromodulators have names that probably you've heard of before
多巴胺 5-羟色胺和乙酰胆碱肾上腺素
things like dopamine and serotonin and acetylcholine epinephrine 
神经调节剂很有意思 因为它们偏爱
neuromodulators are really interesting because they bias
让某些神经元活跃起来
which neurons are likely to be active
以及让哪些不活跃
and which ones are likely to be inactive
想象神经调节剂的一种简单方法是
a simple way to think about neuromodulators is
它们就像是 你拥有的播放列表
they are sort of like playlists that you would have
在 你要播放的特定音乐类别
on any kind of device where you're going to play particular categories of music
例如多巴胺 经常被讨论为
so for instance dopamine which is often discussed as
奖励或喜悦的分子
the molecule of reward or joy
参与奖励 当它适量释放到大脑中时
is involved in reward and it does tend to create a sort of
它的确会创造一种乐观情绪
upbeat mood in when released in appropriate amounts in the brain
但这是因为
but the reason it does that is because
它使某些神经元和神经回路
it makes certain neurons and neural circuits
更活跃 而让另外的不那么活跃
as we call them more active and others less active
例如血清素是一种分子  它被释放时
okay so serotonin for instance is a molecule that when released
往往会使我们对自己拥有的东西  感到非常满足
tends to make us feel really good with what we have
对我们的内心世界和拥有的资源
our sort of internal landscape and the resources that we have
而多巴胺不仅仅是奖励分子
whereas dopamine more than being a molecule of reward is really
更多属于一种动力分子
more a molecule of motivation toward
产生于我们想要追求外部东西的时候
things that are outside us and that we want to pursue
我们可以看看健康的状况
and we can look at healthy conditions or situations like
或者追求目标的时候 每次我们完成某件事
being in pursuit of a goal where every time we accomplish something
在实现该目标的过程中
in route to that goal a little bit of
多巴胺释放 我们会感到更有动力
dopamine is released and we feel more motivation
我们也可以看一下躁狂症的极端例子
that happens uh we can also look at the extreme example of something like mania
你知道的  有人会
where somebody is so you know
不懈地追求诸如金钱之类的外部事物
relentlessly in pursuit of external things like money
和社交关系
and relationships that they're sort of
在这种妄想状态下
in this delusional state of thinking
他们认为自己拥有所需的资源 以便
that they have the resources that they need in order to
追求所有这些东西 而实际上他们并不拥有那些
pursue all these things when in fact they don't
所以这些神经调节剂可以正常水平存在
so these neuromodulators can exist in normal levels
低水平高水平 实际上
low levels high levels and that actually
这给了我们一个窗口
gives us a window into a
去了解神经科学历史的一个非常重要的方面 
very important aspect of neuroscience history that 
影响到了我们每一个人
all of us are impacted by today which is the discovery of
就是抗抑郁药和所谓的抗精神病药
antidepressants and so-called antipsychotics
在20世纪5、6、70年代被发现
in the 1950s 60s and 70s it was discovered
有化合物的化学物质
that there are compounds chemicals that
可以增加或减少血清素
can increase or decrease serotonin
可以增加或减少多巴胺
that can increase or decrease dopamine
这促成了大多数
and that led to the development of most of
我们所谓的抗抑郁药的发展
what we call antidepressants
现在的窍门或问题在于 其中大多数
now the trick here or the problem is that most of these
特别是50和60年代的药品
drugs especially in the 1950s and 60s
他们会减少血清素 但他们
they would reduce serotonin but they
也会减少
would also reduce
多巴胺 否则它们会增加
dopamine or they would increase
血清素 但它们也会增加
serotonin but they would also increase
其他一些神经调节剂或化学物质
some other neuromodulator or chemical
那是因为
and that's because
体内所有这些化学系统
all these chemical systems in the body
但尤其是神经调节剂
but the neuromodulators in particular
现在有很多受体
have a lot of receptors now these are
与我们之前讨论的受体不同
different than the receptors we were talking about earlier
我现在正在谈论的受体是
the receptors i'm talking about now are
有点像停车位
sort of like parking spots where
多巴胺被释放 如果它附着在心脏的受体上 
dopamine is released and if it attaches to a receptor say on the heart
可能会使心脏跳动更快
 it might make the heart beat faster
因为有某种
because there's a certain kind of
心脏上的受体 
receptor on the heart whereas if
如果多巴胺被释放并去附着肌肉
dopamine is released and goes and attaches to
可能会对肌肉有完全不同的影响
muscle it might have a completely different effect on muscle 
它的确如此  所以不同的受体在
it does so different receptors on
身体不同器官
different organs of the body are the ways
这些神经调节剂可以拥有所有
that these neuromodulators can have all
这些对我们生理不同方面的影响
these different effects on different aspects of our biology
在示例中这是最明显的
this is um most salient in the example
一些抗抑郁药会有
of some of the antidepressants that have
性方面的副作用
sexual side effects or that blunt
或抑制食欲 或抑制欲望
appetite or that blunt motivation
你知道如果你增加了5-羟色胺
you know if you many of these which increase serotonin
可以对人们非常有益
can be very beneficial for people it can
可以提升他们的心情 可以使他们感觉更好 
elevate their mood it can make them feel better but they also
但如果他们的剂量太高
at if their the doses are too high or if
或者那种特定药物不适合某人
that particular drug isn't right for somebody
那个人会有动力 食欲
that person experiences challenges with motivation or appetite
或性欲方面的问题 因为血清素可以
or libido because serotonin is binding
约束到大脑区域的受体
to receptors in the areas of the brain
也可以控制其他东西
that control those other things as well 
所以我们谈到了感觉 
so we talked about sensation we
谈论感知
talked about perception
当我们谈论感情时 我们必须
when we talk about feelings we have to
考虑这些神经调节剂 我们
consider these neuromodulators and we
还必须考虑到 在某些文化中 感觉和情感是与环境相关的
have to consider also that feelings and emotions are contextual in some cultures
一些文化中  表现出很多喜悦或悲伤是完全没问题的
showing a lot of joy or a lot of sadness is entirely appropriate
在其他文化中 这被认为是不合适的
in other cultures it's considered inappropriate 
所以我认为有一个不公平的说法是不公平的
so i don't think it's fair to say that there's a
悲伤回路或大脑区域或
sadness circuit or area of the brain or
大脑的快乐回路或区域
a happiness circuit or area of the brain
但是可以公平地说 某些化学物质
however it is fair to say that certain chemicals
某些大脑回路倾向于
and certain brain circuits tend to be
在充满动力的状态下保持活跃
active when we are in motivated states
在无动力的懒惰状态下倾向于活跃
tend to be active when we are in non-motivated lazy states
当我们专注时倾向于活跃
tend to be active when we are focused
当我们处于不集中时倾向于活跃
and tend to be active when we are not focused
我想强调的是
 i want to emphasize
情感是我们
also that emotions are something that we
通常感觉不受我们的控制的东西
generally feel are not under our control
我们觉得它们有点像
we feel like they kind of guys are up
在我们内部 它们就这么在我们身上发生了
within us and they just kind of happen
 那是因为它们有些反射性
to us and that's because they are somewhat reflexive
我们并没有
we don't really set out with a
故意想要幸福或故意想要悲伤
deliberate thought to be happy or deliberate thought to be sad
我们倾向于以一种被动的反射方式来体验它们
we tend to experience them in kind of a passive reflexive way
这将我们带入下一个话题
and that brings us to the next thing
那就是“想法”  想法真的很有趣 因为
which are thoughts thoughts are really interesting because
在许多方面 它们就像感知
in many ways they're like perceptions
除了它们
except that they draw
不仅在当前发生的事情上 而且在
on not just what's happening in the present but also
发生在我们回想起过去的事情
things we remember from the past and
和我们对未来的预期之中
things that we anticipate about the future
关于想法的另一件事是
the other thing about thoughts that's
真正有趣的是
really interesting is that thoughts
想法既可以是反射 就好像
can be both reflexive they can just be occurring all
去广告功能很差的网络浏览器
the time sort of like pop-up windows on
一直在弹出窗口
a poorly filtered web browser
或者它可以是刻意行为 我们可以先考虑一下
or they can be deliberate we can decide to have a thought
实际上  你现在可以决定
in fact right now you could decide to
有一个想法  就好像你
have a thought just like you would
决定在纸上写点东西
decide to write something out on a piece of paper
你可以决定你在某个地点
you could decide that you're listening
要听某个播客
to a podcast that you are in a particular location
你不只是在注意正在发生的事情
you're not just paying attention to
 你还在主导思维过程的形成
what's happening you're directing your thought process
很多人不了解或
and a lot of people don't understand or
不知道 
at least appreciate that the thought
思维模式和潜在的神经回路
patterns and the neural circuits that underlie
思想实际上可以通过刻意的方式来控制
thoughts can actually be controlled in this deliberate way
最后有动作
and then finally there are actions
动作或行为可能是我们神经系统最重要的方面
actions or behaviors are perhaps the most important aspect to our nervous system
因为首先 我们的行为是
because first of all our behaviors are
其实唯一会创造
actually the only thing that are going to create
我们存在过的记录的东西
any fossil record of our existence you
我们死后 神经系统会腐烂
know after we die the nervous system
我们的骨骼将被保留
deteriorates our skeleton will remain
但是在你在经历
but it's you know in the moment of of
非常快乐或非常悲伤的事情的时候
something very joyful or something very sad
它可以感觉到无所不包 以至于我们会认为它有一些
it can feel so all-encompassing that we actually think that it has some
超越那一刻的意义
meaning beyond that moment
但实际上对于人类 我认为对于所有物种
but actually for humans and i think for all species
感觉 知觉和思想
the sensations the perceptions and the thoughts
以及我们一生中的感受
and the feelings that we have in our lifespan
这些实际上都没有结转
none of that is actually carried forward
除了我们拿来的 然后转换成
except the ones that we take and we convert into
比如写作
actions such as writing actions such as
说话  设计新事物 的行为
words actions such as engineering new things
因此我们物种的化石记录
and so the fossil record of our species
都是通过动作记录每一个人
and of each one of us is really through action
这些分解成小部分 就是为什么我们如此多的神经系统
and that in part is why so much of our nervous system is
都致力于转换
devoted to converting
感觉 感知 思考
sensation perceptions feelings and thoughts
付诸行动 
into actions in fact the great
神经科学家和生理学家Sharington
neuroscientist or physiologist
他曾获得了诺贝尔奖
sharington won a nobel prize for his
研究的是绘制一些电流
work in mapping some of the circuitry the
引起运动的神经细胞之间的连接
connections between nerve cells that give rise to movement
他说运动是最后的共同途径
and he said movement is the final common pathway
另一种思考的方式是
the other way to think about it is that one of the reasons that
我们的中枢神经系统 大脑和脊髓  包括
our central nervous system our brain and spinal cord include
我们头骨里的东西 
this stuff in our skull but also
如此紧密地连接到身体
connects so heavily to the body
是因为  几乎所有我们的
is because most everything that we
体验 包括我们的想法和感受
experience including our thoughts and feelings
确实旨在影响我们的行为
was really designed to either impact our behavior or not
思想使我们能够
and the fact that thoughts allow us to
进入过去并期待
reach into the past and anticipate the
未来 而不仅仅是体验当下正在发生的事情
future and not just experience what's happening in the moment
给我们带来了不可思议的能力
gave rise to an incredible capacity for us to
产生不只是基于
engage in behaviors that are not just
目前他们的事物行为
for the moment they're based on things
我们从过去知道 并且我们在未来希望看到的
that we know from the past and that we would like to see
以及我们神经系统的这一方面
in the future and this aspect to our nervous system
通过一些非常简单的途径进行运动创造
of creating movement occurs through some very simple pathways
反射路径主要包括
the reflexive pathway basically includes
脑干区域我们称为中央模式生成器
areas of the brainstem we call central pattern generators
当你走路时 你已经知道如何走路
when you walk provided you already know how to walk
你能走路基本上 是因为你
you are basically walking because you
有这些中心模式产生
have these central pattern generates
运动的神经元群  左右 左右
groups of neurons that generate right foot left foot kind of movement
但是 当你决定使用
however when you decide to move in a
更多刻意控制的走路  你需要一些注意力
particular deliberate way that requires a little more attention
你开始动脑筋
you start to engage areas of your brain
在前脑工作的地方进行自上而下的处理
for top-down processing where your forebrain works
从上到下控制那些
from the top down to control those
中央模式发生器
central pattern generators so that maybe
比如  右 右 左
it's right foot right foot left foot
右 右 左 这么走 
right foot right foot left foot if maybe
可能你正在沿着岩石远足或什么
you're hiking along some rocks or
你必须这么走
something and you have to engage in that kind of movement
所以运动就像思想
so movement is just like thoughts
可以是反射或刻意的
can be either reflexive or deliberate
当我们谈论刻意的时候
and when we talk about deliberate i want
具体来说
to be very specific about
 你的大脑改如何在刻意的情况下工作
how your brain works in the deliberate
因为随之产生的
way because it give gives rise to
是神经系统的一个非常重要的特征
a very important feature of the nervous
我们接下来会讨论的
system that we're going to talk about
就是是你有改变神经系统的能力
next which is your ability to change your nervous system
我想先谈一谈的是这个概念
and what i'd like to center on for a second is this notion
神经系统刻意做某事
of what does it mean for the nervous
意味着什么
system to do something deliberately
好 当你故意做某事时
well when you do something deliberately
你开始注意 你带来了你的感知
you pay attention you are bringing your perception
来分析三件事
to an analysis of three things 
持续时间  需要花费多长时间 或应该完成的时间
duration how long something is going to take or should be done
路径  你应该做什么
path what you should be doing an 
结果  你在给定的时间内做某事 将会发生什么
outcome if you do something for a given length of time what's going to happen
现在 当你走在街上
now when you're walking down the street
或正在吃东西或只是在说话
or you're eating or you're just talking
你不是在做我所说的
reflexively you're not doing this what i
DPO(持续时间/路径/结果)
called DPO duration path outcome
 你的大脑和神经系统的刻意功能类型
type of deliberate function in your brain and nervous system
但是当你决定学习的那一刻
but the moment you decide to learn
或拒绝说话
something or to resist speaking
或在 你宁愿安静时大声说出来
or to speak up when you would rather be quiet
任何时候你故意强迫自己
anytime you're deliberately forcing
超过阈值
yourself over a threshold
你正在调动这些大脑循环
you're engaging these brain circuits and
调动这些神经系统回路
these nervous system circuits
你会突然觉得
that suddenly make it feel as if
有什么在挑战你
something is challenging something has
有东西变了
changed
好 那什么是改变 
well what's changed 
改变就是  当你在调动
what's changed is that when you engage in this duration
关于DPO的思考
path and outcome type of
行为 或存在方式
thinking or behavior or way of being
你开始利用那些
you start to recruit these
神经调节剂
neuromodulators
从大脑的特定区域释放
that are released from particular areas
也从你的身体释放你的身体
of your brain and also it turns out from your body
他们开始提示你的神经系统
and they start cueing to your nervous
有什么东西不一样了
system something's different something's
我在做的事情不一样了
different now about what i'm doing
我的感受不一样了
something's different about what i'm
让我们举个例子
feeling let's let's give an example
也许有人说了一些什么
perhaps somebody says something that's
戳了你的痛点 你不喜欢它
triggering to you you don't like it
而且你知道你不应该回应的
and you know you shouldn't respond you
“我不应该回应...
feel like i shouldn't respond i
我不应该回应 我不应该回应”
shouldn't respond i shouldn't respond
你正在积极压制你的行为
you're actively suppressing your
自上而下控制
behavior through top-down
实际上你的前脑在
processing your forebrain is actually
阻止你说这句话
preventing you from saying the thing
那句你
that you
知道你不应该说或者也许你
know you shouldn't say or that maybe you
应该等待以不同的方式说 或以不同的形式说
should wait to say or say in a different form
感觉就像是激动和压力
this feels like agitation and stress
因为你实际上是在压制
because you're actually suppressing a
回路
circuit
我们实际上可以看到一些例子
we actually can see examples of what
当 你做得不好时会发生
happens when you're not doing this well
这些例子来自
some of the examples uh come from
孩子 你看看孩子
children if you look at young children
他们没有前脑回路
they don't have the forebrain circuitry
来处理这种自上而下的控制
to engage in this top-down processing
直到他们达到大概 22甚至25
until they reach age you know 22 even 25
但在小孩身上 你会发现
but in young children you see this in a
一个很稳定的现象
really robust way
 你会看到他们前后摇摆 
you'll see they'll be rocking back and
他们很难坐下来
forth it's hard for them to sit still
因为那些中央模式发生器
because those central pattern generators
一直在后台运作
are constantly going in the background
大人可以坐着
whereas adults can sit still
一个孩子看到一块糖果 
a kid sees a piece of candy that it
他会想要并且会伸出手来抓
wants and will just reach out and grab it
而成年人可能会问
whereas an adult probably would ask if
他们是否可以吃一块 或等到
they could have a piece or wait until
别人给他们
they were offered a piece
在大多数情况下 
in most cases people that have damage to
额叶缺少某些区域的人
certain areas of the frontal lobes don't
会有这种限制 他们会
have this kind of restriction they'll
直接脱口而出
just blurt things out
他们会直接说  我们都知道这样的人
they'll just say things we all know
冲动的人是缺乏
people like this impulsivity is a lack
自上而下控制的 缺乏自上而下的处理
of top-down control a lack of top-down
另一件事将关闭
the other thing that will turn off the
前脑并使其难以自上而下处理的
forebrain and make it harder to top down
是几杯含酒精的饮料
is a couple of drinks containing alcohol
好
well
消除抑制作用实际上是
the removal of inhibition is actually a
去除
removal of
神经细胞对其他神经细胞
neural inhibition of nerve cells suppressing the activity of 
的神经抑制 所以当你
of other nerve cells and so when you
看那些额叶有损伤的人
look at people that have damage to their frontal lobes
你看着看小狗 或者你看看小孩子
or you look at puppies or you look at young children
一切都是刺激 一切都是
everything is a stimulus everything is a
它们之间潜在的互动
potential interaction for them and they
很难限制他们的
have a very hard time restricting their
行为及其言语
behavior and their speech
所以很多动力系统都是
so a lot of the motor system is designed
以反射的工作方式设计的
to just work in a reflexive way
然后当我们决定要学习
and then when we decide we want to learn
或做某事
something or do something or
或者不做某事时  我们必须调动
not do something we have to engage in
这种自上而下的限制 感觉
this top-down restriction and it feels
之所以像不安的感觉 是因为它伴随着
like agitation because it's accompanied
释放
by the release
称为神经调节剂的
of a neuromodulator called
去甲肾上腺素
norepinephrine
在体内我们称之为肾上腺素和
which in the body we call adrenaline and
实际上让我们感到烦躁
it actually makes us feel agitated
所以对于那些想要
so for those of you that are trying to
学习新东西或学习
learn something new or to learn to
压抑你的回应  或更多地主动控制
suppress your responses or be more deliberate
并谨慎地回应
and careful in your responses that is
那就是去
going to
由于特定原因感到挑战
feel challenging for a particular reason
这会很有挑战 因为
it's going to feel challenging because
 你体内的化学物质是
the chemicals in your body that are
与之相关的释放
released in association with that
努力让你感到
effort are designed to make you feel
那种低水平的震颤
kind of agitated that low-level tremor
有时人们在
that sometimes people feel when they're
真的很生气
really really angry
实际上是化学物质诱导的
is actually a chemically induced
低度震颤
low-level tremor
这就是我所说的大脑边缘系统阻力
and it's the what i call limbic friction
你的大脑有一个区域
there's an area of your brain that's
参与我们更原始的反射反应
involved in our more primitive reflexive responses
称为边缘系统和额叶皮层
called the limbic system and the frontal cortex
在摩擦中 在拔河中
is in a friction it's in a tug of war
在那个系统中
with that system
一直以来 除非你有
all the time unless of course you have
额叶受损或 你曾经
damage to the frontal lobe or you've had
喝太多或其他损伤
too much to drink or something in which
那样你就会倾向于
case you tend to just say and do
随心所欲的说和做事情
whatever
所以明白这个很重要
and so this is really important to
是因为
understand because
如果你想了解
if you want to understand
 你想了解的神经可塑性
neuroplasticity you want to understand
如何塑造自己的行为
how to shape your behavior how to shape
塑造自己的想法
your thinking how to
改变 你在任何情况下的行为方式
change how you're able to perform in any
最重要的事情要理解
the most important thing to understand
是它需要
is that it requires
自上而下的处理 需要这样的
top-down processing it requires this
不安感  其实我倒偏向于说
feeling of agitation in fact i would say
躁动和压力是个入口
that agitation and strain is the entry
走向神经可塑性
point to neural plasticity
让我们看一下神经可塑性是什么
so let's take a look at what neural
我们去探索一下
plasticity is let's explore it not
不像通常所说的那样
as the way it's normally talked about in
什么 现代文化与神经可塑性
modern cultures and neuroplasticity
可塑性很好 之类的
plasticity is great
大家说的到底是什么意思
what what exactly do people mean
可塑性本身只是一个过程
plasticity itself is just a process by
神经元可以改变它们的连接
neurons can change their connections in
它们的工作方式
the way they work so
这样你就可以摆脱
that you you can go from things being
那些非常有挑战性和刻意的
very challenging and deliberate
需要很多努力和压力的行为
requiring a lot of effort and strain
使他们变成反射 通常
to them being reflexive and typically
当我们听到可塑性的时候
when we hear about plasticity we're
考虑积极或我所说的
thinking about positive or what i call
适应性可塑性
adaptive
很多可塑性
plasticity a lot of plasticity can be
例如由脑损伤引起 但
induced for instance by brain damage but
一般不是那种我们想要的可塑性
generally not the kind of plasticity
当我说可塑性时
that we want so when i say plasticity
除非我特别说明了  一般我的意思就是适应性可塑性
unless i say otherwise i mean adaptive plasticity
特别是大多数
and in particular most of the
人们想要的神经可塑性
neuroplasticity that people
都是自我导向的可塑性 因为
want is self-directed plasticity because
如果只说一个关于
if there's one
神经可塑性的众所周知的事实
truism to neuroplasticity it's that from
那就是从出生到25岁左右
birth until about age 25 the brain
人有令人难以置信的可塑性  孩子们学习
is incredibly plastic kids are learning
各种各样的事情
all sorts of things
他们也可以被动地学习
but they can learn it passively they
不必太努力或
don't have to work too hard or
非常努力集中精力  虽然这肯定效果更好
focus too hard although focus helps to learn new things
不管是掌握新语言 还是掌握新技能
acquire new languages acquire new skills
但是如果你是成年人 你想
but if you're an adult and you want to
改变你的神经回路
change your neural circuitry
在情绪或行为方面
at the level of emotions or behavior or
想法或任何东西
thoughts or anything really
你绝对需要问两个重要的问题
you absolutely need to ask two important
首先
one what particular
我正在尝试改变神经系统的哪个特定的方面
aspect of my nervous system am i trying to change
意思是是想改变我的
meaning am i trying to change my
情绪 还是我的看法  或者是我的感觉
emotions or my perceptions my sensations
还有哪些是我真的能够去
and which ones are available for me to
改变的 然后第二个问题是
change and then the second question is
你打算怎么做
how are you going to go about that what
结构是什么
is the structure
进行神经可塑性治疗的方法结构是什么
of a regimen to engage neuroplasticity
事实证明
and it turns out that the answer to that
第二个问题的答案
second question
取决于我们清醒或犯困的程度
is governed by how awake or how sleepy we are
所以接下来我们来谈谈
so let's talk about that next
神经可塑性是一种能力
neuroplasticity is the ability for these
它根据大脑和身体的连接
connections in the brain and body to
对变化的经历产生响应
change in response to experience
人类的不可思议之处
and what's so incredible about the human
特别是神经系统
nervous system in particular
是我们可以指导自己的神经
is that we can direct our own neural
变化
changes
我们可以决定是否要更改我们的大脑
we can decide that we want to change our
换句话说 我们的大脑可以自己改变
in other words our brain can change
我们的神经系统都会自己改变
itself and our nervous system can change
同样的 我们的其他器官
and the same can't be said for other
就不能这样改变
organs of the body even though our
即便身体其他器官会有一些
other organs of the body have some
改变能力
ability to change
它们无法指导身体 它们无法思考
they can't direct it they can't think
然后决定说  哦 你知道你的肠子不能说
and decide oh you know your gut doesn't
“哦 我想能够...
say oh you know i want to be able to
...更好地消化辛辣食物 所以我要去
digest spicy foods better so i'm going
重新安排连接以便...
rearrange the connections to be able to
更好消化” 而你的大脑可以决定
do that whereas your brain can decide
你想
that you want to
学一门语言 或者你想少一点
learn a language or you want to be less
情绪反应或
emotionally reactive or
更加投入情感  你可以
more emotionally engaged and you can
经历一系列步骤
undergo a series of steps that will
允许
allow
你的大脑做出这些改变 以便
your brain to make those changes so that
最终它成为你的反射
eventually it becomes reflexive for you to do that
这是非常不可思议的
which is absolutely incredible for a
很长时间以来 人们认为
long time it was thought that
神经可塑性是
neuroplasticity was the unique gift of
年轻动物和人类独有的天赋
young animals and humans that it could only
发生在我们年轻的时候
occur when we're young and in fact the
事实上  幼小的大脑非常容易塑造
young brain is incredibly plastic
孩子们可以学习三种语言
children can learn three languages
而没有口音
without an accent reflexively
而对于成年人  这是非常具有挑战性的
whereas adults it's very challenging it
需要更多的努力和压力
takes a lot more effort and strain a lot
更多的去想持续时间 路径 结果的办法
more of that duration path outcome kind
为了实现那些可塑变化
of thinking in order to achieve those
我们现在知道的
plastic changes we now know however that
成人的大脑可以改变对于经历的反应
the adult brain can change in response to experience
诺贝尔奖曾经颁给过
nobel prizes were given for uh the
一项研究年轻的大脑可以发生非常大变化的研究
understanding that the young brain can change very dramatically
我认为最
 i think one of the most
极端的一个例子是
extreme examples would be
对于那些天生瞎眼的人
uh for people that are born blind from birth
他们用他们的大脑区域
they use the area of their brain that
通常用于
normally would be used for
可视化对象和颜色 以及
visualizing objects and colors and
他们外面的东西
things outside of them
用于大脑成像中的盲文阅读
for braille reading in brain imaging
研究表明
studies it's been shown that you know
出生时失明的人
people who are blind from birth when
他们盲文阅读时
they braille read
大脑的区域
the area of the brain that would
通常会被点亮
normally light up
跟随意愿  视觉区域被
if you will to for vision lights up for
盲文阅读点亮
braille reading so
该块区域已重新分配给
that real estate is reallocated for an
完全不同的功能
entirely different function
如果某人成年后失明
if someone is made blind in adulthood
他们的整个视觉大脑不太可能
it's unlikely that their entire visual
被那些
brain will be taken over
负责接触的大脑区域
by the areas of the brain they're
所接管
responsible for touch
但是有一些证据表明
however there's some evidence that areas
涉及听觉和触觉的大脑
of the brain that are involved in hearing and touch
可以迁移到视觉区域 
can kind of migrate into that area and
现在有很多人感兴趣去尝试
there's a lot of interest now in trying
弄清楚如何
to figure out how
诱导更多的可塑性
more plasticity can be induced in
在成年后  诱导更积极的可塑性
adulthood more positive plasticity
为了了解那个过程
and in order to understand that process
我们真的必须了解
we really have to understand
一开始似乎有些东西
something that might at first seem
完全脱离了神经可塑性
totally divorced from neuroplasticity
但实际上位于
but actually lies at the center of
神经可塑性的中心 对于任何人
neuroplasticity and for any of you that
有兴趣改变你的神经系统
are interested in changing your nervous system
这样你想要的东西就可以
so that something that you want can go
从非常努力 或看起来
from being very hard or seem
几乎不可能且遥不可及
almost impossible and out of reach to
变成反射反应
being very reflexive
这对尤为重要
this is especially important to pay
要多多关注
attention to
成人神经系统的可塑性
plasticity in the adult human nervous
被限制了
system is gated
意味着它是由
meaning it is controlled by
神经调节剂所控制
neuromodulators
我们前面谈论的这些事情
these things that we talked about
多巴胺  5-羟色胺
earlier dopamine serotonin
特别是一个叫
and one in particular called
乙酰胆碱的东西
acetylcholine
是它们打开了成人的可塑性
are what open up plasticity they
从字面上看
literally
揭示可塑性并允许
unveil plasticity and allow brief
在短时间内
periods of time in which whatever
无论什么信息
information
无论我们正在感觉的 还是
whatever thing we're sensing or
感知或思考的东西
perceiving or thinking
或我们能感觉到的任何情绪
or whatever emotions we feel can
可以映射到大脑
literally be mapped in the brain
这样以后会变得
such that later it will become much
让我们更容易体验和感觉
easier for us to experience and feel
那个事物
that thing
那么 它就有阴暗面和积极的一面 
now this has a dark side and a positive side
黑暗的一面是  实际上
the dark side is it's actually very easy
成年后获得神经可塑性很简单
to get neuroplasticity as an adult
通过创伤 可怕的经历
through traumatic or terrible or
或者挑战性的经历
challenging experiences
但重要的问题是 为什么会是这样
but the important question is to say why is that
其中的原因是
and the reason that's the case is
因为当一些
because when
非常糟糕的事情发生的时候
something very bad happens there's the release
两组神经调节剂会在脑部被释放
of two sets of neuromodulators in the brain
肾上腺素 往往使我们感到
epinephrine which tends to make us feel
与之相关的紧张和不安
alert and agitated which is associated
发生在大多数
with most
不良情况  乙酰胆碱
bad circumstances and acetylcholine
这往往会创造一个
which tends to create a
更加强烈和集中的感性聚光灯
even more intense and focused perceptual
记得我们之前
spotlight remember earlier we were
谈论感知
talking about perception
以及它如何像聚光灯
and how it's kind of like a spotlight
乙酰胆碱使光
acetylcholine makes that light
特别明亮
particularly bright and particularly
极度局限于
restricted
我们经验的一个领域
to one region of our experience and it
通过使某些神经元进入
does that by making certain neurons in
我们的大脑
our brain and
和身体
and body active
比其他的要活跃得多
much more than all the rest so
乙酰胆碱有点像
acetylcholine is sort of like a
荧光笔
highlighter marker
画出神经可塑性出现的地方
upon which neuroplasticity then comes in later
然后说等等  哪些神经元活跃了？
and says wait which neurons were active
在这特别的
in this particularly
警惕阶段  无论在白天
alerting phase of whatever you know day
或晚上 只要这件事发生
or night whenever this thing happened to
它就会这样
happen
所以它的工作方式是
so the way it works is this you can
想想肾上腺素
think of epinephrine as creating this
它创造了这种警惕和令人难以置信的
alertness and this kind of unbelievable
注意力增加水平
increased attention compared to what you
比你平时更高
were experiencing before
你可以认为乙酰胆碱是
and you can think of acetylcholine as
是一种分子
being the molecule
它突出显示发生的一切
that highlights whatever it happens
在警惕感增高的那段时期
during that period of heightened alert
所以要清楚一点 是肾上腺素
so just to be clear it's epinephrine
创建警觉性
creates the alertness
如果感兴趣的话
that's coming from a subset of neurons
它(肾上腺素)来自神经元的子集
in the brainstem if you're interested
乙酰胆碱来自
and acetylcholine coming from an area of
前脑
the forebrain
标记那些
is tagging or marking the neurons that
在这期间特别活跃的神经元
are particularly active during this
提高了警觉性
heightened level of alertness now that
标记细胞的神经元和
marks the cells the neurons and the
突触
synapses
为了加强 为了在未来提高活跃的可能性
for strengthening for becoming more likely to be
即使没有我们没有考虑这个事
active in the future even without us thinking about it
好吧 所以在糟糕的情况下 这一切
okay so in bad circumstances this all
的发生
happens
不需要我们做很多事情
without us having to do much when we
但如果我们自己想要什么 我们想要
want something to happen however we want
学习我们想要的新语言
to learn a new language we want to
想要学习更多的新技能
learn a new skill we want to become more
想要有更多的动力  我们能确定的是
motivated what do we know for certain we know that
获得神经可塑性的过程
that process of getting neuroplasticity
以便于我们更加专注
so that we have more focus more
更有动力
motivation
绝对需要释放
absolutely requires the release of
肾上腺素  我们必须保持警惕
epinephrine we have to have alertness in
为的是专注
order to have focus
而且我们必须专注
and we have to have focus in order to
便于主导那些在神经系统的特定部位
direct those plastic changes
发生的可塑性变化
to particular parts of our nervous
这些对于
system now this has
思考神经系统有很大的作用
immense implications in thinking about
各种工具 无论是否
the various tools whether or not those
是化学物质或是机器
are chemical tools or machine tools
或只是自我诱导的方法
or just self-induced regimens of how
你要集中多久 多深
long or how intensely you're going to
以获得神经可塑性
focus in order to get neuroplasticity
但另一方面
but there's another side to it the dirty
神经可塑性的一个特征是
secret of neuroplasticity is that no
没有任何神经可塑性
no neuroplasticity
发生在 你尝试
occurs during the thing you're trying to
学习期间
learn during
或者在创伤事件期间
the terrible event 
亦或是美好的时候
during the great event
在你真的是
during the thing that you're really
试图塑造和学习的时候
trying to shape and learn
实际上 持续的神经元之间
nothing is actually changing between the
没有任何变化
neurons that is going to last
所有的神经可塑性
all the neuroplasticity the
突触的加强
strengthening of the synapses
这种增加新神经细胞
the addition in some cases of new nerve cells
或至少是增加神经之间的联系的情况
or at least connections between nerve
所有都发生在
cells all of that occurs
人生的截然不同的阶段
at a very different phase of life which
是当我们在
is when we are in
睡眠和非睡眠深度休息的时候
sleep and non-sleep deep rest and so
人类经历中的节点
holy grail of human experience of
比如说 这是新的一年 
you know this is the new year and
大家都在想新年计划
everyone's thinking new year's resolution and
现在也许一切都井然有序
right now perhaps everything's organized
人们很有上进心 但是
and people are highly motivated but what
到了三四月份 或者五月份 情况又不一样了
happens in march or april or may
 这取决于
well that all depends on how much
当一个人正在尝试学习时
attention and focus
取决于他可以不断带给大脑的
one can continually bring to whatever it
注意和集中的多少
is they're trying to learn
如此之多 以至于需要一定的不安和压力
so much so that agitation and a feeling of strain are actually required
为了这个神经可塑性的过程
for this process of neural plasticity to
能够被触发
get triggered
但实际 发生在
but the actual rewiring occurs during
睡眠时间和
periods of sleep and
非睡眠深度休息的重新连接
non-sleep deep rest there's a study
去年发表有一项研究
published last year that's particularly
我特别想分享出来 这项研究
relevant here that i want to share was
不是我实验室做的
not done by my laboratory
研究表明20分钟的深度休息
that showed that 20 minutes of deep rest
这不是深度睡眠 而是
this is not deep sleep but essentially
在你做某件非常困难和非常
doing something very hard and very
高强度的事情之后 花费20分钟
intense and then taking 20 minutes
马上
afterward immediately afterwards to
刻意的
deliberately
去关闭刻意的集中思考
turn off the deliberate focused thinking
和想法
and engagement
这加速了神经可塑性
actually accelerated neuroplasticity
还有另一项研究
there's another study that's just
令人难以置信 我们将会讲到
incredible and we're going to go into this
在播客之后的一集中
in a future episode of the podcast not
不久之后就会讲到
too long from now
表明如果人们正在学习
that showed that if people are learning
一种特殊的技能 可能是
a particular skill it could be a
语言技能或运动技能
language skill or a motor skill
他们听到背景的声音
and they hear a tone just playing in the background
这个声音在循环播放
the tone is playing periodically the
是铃铛的响声
background like just a bell
就在深度睡眠中 如果那个铃声响起
in deep sleep if that bell is played
相比于他们清醒的时候
learning is much faster for the thing
他们的学习速度要快得多
that they were learning
不知怎么的它在睡眠中激发了神经系统
it somehow cues the nervous system
不一定是要在做梦
in sleep doesn't even have to be in dreaming that
在我们清醒阶段
something that happened in our the
发生的事情尤其重要
waking phase was especially important
到这样程度以致铃声变成了一种
so much so that that bell is sort of a
帕夫洛夫式的提示
pavlovian cue
这有点像在提示睡眠的大脑
it's sort of a reminder to the sleeping
哦 你需要记住那一天中的特定时间里
brain oh you need to remember what it is that you were learning at that
你在学的是什么
particular time of day and the learning
而学习速率
rates
知识的留存率意味着
and the rates of retention meaning how
在那种条件下
much people can remember from the thing
人们可以从中记住
they learned
他们所学到的  要更多
are significantly higher under those condition
所以我要说说如何应用
so i'm going to talk about how to apply
所有这些知识
all this knowledge in
在这集播客中会说一点
a little bit more in this podcast
但以后还会再讲
episode but also in future episodes
但这确实说明了真正的关键
but it really speaks to the really key
睡眠和注意力 这两个
of sleep and focus these two
在相反两端的注意状态
opposite ends of our attentional state
当我们在睡觉时
when we're in sleep
这些DPO(持续时间/路径/结果)分析
these dpos duration path and outcome
是不可能的
analysis are impossible
我们就是做不到
we just can't do that we are only in
我们只与身体里面发生的事情有联系
relation to what's happening inside of us
所以睡眠是关键 另一个关键是
so sleep is key also key are periods of
我们的非睡眠深度休息时间
non-sleep deep rest where we're turning
在我们对DPO分析中
off our analysis of duration path and
特别是对于我们曾经
in particular for the thing that we were
只是想学习的东西
just trying to learn
而我们处于这种极限状态
and we're in this kind of liminal state
我们的注意力有点分散了
our attention is kind of drifting all
事实证明 这对于巩固神经细胞之间的变化
over it turns out that's very important
非常重要
for the consolidation for the changes
这将使我们能够
the nerve cells that will allow what we
试图从
were trying to learn to go from being
刻意
deliberate and
艰难 压力 中脱身
hard and stressful and a strain to
转为简单且反射性 这也指出
easy and reflexive this also points to how
不同的人 包括许多现代
different people including many modern
临床医生正在考虑如何
clinicians are thinking about how to
避免
prevent
不好的情况下 由创伤带来的
bad circumstances traumas from routing
永久地进入我们的神经系统
their way into our nervous system permanently
你可能想干涉
it says that you might want to interfere
在某些方面
with certain aspects
将大脑远离不好的事情发生的状态
of brain states that are away from the bad thing that happened that happen
让大脑状态在下一天
the brain states that happen the next
或下个月或下一年都远离这些
day or the next month or the next year
我也想知道
and also i want to be aware i want to
我想确保我
make sure that i
有注意到  很多人
pay attention to the fact that for many
你在想
of you you're thinking about
不仅仅是神经可塑性
neuroplasticity not just
在改变你的神经系统以增加
in changing your nervous system to add
一些新东西 但也要摆脱
something new but to also get rid of
你不喜欢的东西
things that you don't like
是吗 你想忘记不好的
right that you want to forget bad
经历或至少不要
experiences or at least remove the
坏关系的情绪偶然性
emotional contingency of a bad relationship
或与某事物的不良关系或
or a bad relationship to something or
某人或某事
some person or some event
学习少怕某些事情
learning to fear certain things less to
消除恐惧症  消除创伤
eliminate a phobia to erase a trauma
记忆本身不会被抹去
the memories themselves don't get erased
我很遗憾地说 回忆不会
i'm sorry to say that the memories don't
自己被抹去 但情感
themselves get erased but the emotional
可以减少内存负荷
load of memories can be reduced
有很多不同的方式
and there are a number of different ways
可以让那发生 但他们都
that that can happen but they all
需要我们正在讨论的东西
require this thing that we're calling
就是神经可塑性
calling neuroplasticity we're going to
我们将会有一个
have a
关于神经可塑性的大量讨论
large number of discussions about
深度讨论
neuroplasticity in depth but
最重要的事情就是
the most important thing to understand
这确实是两个阶段的过程
is that it is indeed a two-phase
决定警惕和专注之间
process what governs the transition between
的转变  以及
alert and focused and these
深度休息和深度睡眠状态的转变
deep rest and deep sleep states is a
是我们大脑和身体中的系统
system in our brain and body
是神经系统的某个部分
a certain aspect of the nervous system
称为自主神经系统
called the autonomic nervous system
非常重要的是
and it is immensely important to
要了解这种自主神经系统
understand how this autonomic nervous
如何工作
system works
它的名字跟
it has names like the sympathetic
交感神经系统和副交感神经系统差不多
nervous system and parasympathetic
坦白说 神经系统
nervous system which frankly
是复杂的名称 因为它们
are complicated names because they're a
有点误导性  交感神经系统
little bit misleading sympathetic is the
和警惕性关系更大
one that's associated with more
副交感神经系统则
alertness parasympathetic is the one
会带来更多的平静
that's associated with more calmness
这确实引起误解 因为
and it gets really misleading because
交感神经系统
the sympathetic nervous system
听起来很有同情感 然后人们
sounds like sympathy and then people
认为这与我要平静下来有关
think it's related to calm i'm going to
我会称之为警觉系统
call it the alertness system
和平静系统 因为即使
and the calmness system because even though
交感和副交感是
sympathetic and parasympathetic are
有时候用过的人真的会
sometimes used people really get
感到困惑
confused
所以思考自主性的方式
so the way to think about the autonomic
神经系统及其原因
nervous system and the reason it's
重要的是
important for
生活的方方面面
every aspect of your life but in
特别是对于神经可塑性
particular for neuroplasticity
并参与这些集中的状态
and engaging in these focused states and
然后这些散焦状态
then these defocus states
就像跷跷板一样
is that it works sort of like a seesaw
每24小时
every 24 hours
我们都熟悉这样的事实
we're all familiar with the fact that
当我们早上醒来时 我们可能
when we wake up in the morning we might
有点昏昏沉沉 但是
be a little bit groggy but then
通常我们比较警惕
generally we're more alert
然后随着傍晚的来临 我们倾向于
and then as evening comes around we tend
变得更加放松
to become a little more relaxed and
和困乏 最终
sleepy and eventually
晚上某个时候我们要睡觉
at some point at night we go to sleep so
我们从警惕
we go from alert
到非常平静 然后为了达到这些
to deeply calm and as we do that we go
我们的能力从非常
from an ability to engage in these very
专注
focused
经过DPO分析
duration path outcome types of analyses
到了
to states
在睡眠中
in sleep that are completely divorced
那个状态完全脱离了DPO分析
from duration path and outcome
一切都是完全随机的
in which everything is completely random
并且不受我们的限制
and untethered in terms of our
感觉 感知 感受
sensations perceptions and feelings and
之类的
so forth
因此 每隔24小时 我们就会进入一个阶段
so every 24 hours we have a phase of our day
从最适合思考和
that is optimal for thinking and
集中注意力
focusing
适合学习  以及有神经可塑性
and learning and neuroplasticity and
有精力做各种事情
doing all sorts of things we have energy
在一天的另一阶段
as well and at another phase of our day
我们累了
we're tired
而且我们没有能力集中精力
and we have no ability to focus we have
无法参与DPO
no ability to engage in duration path
分析
outcome types of analyses
有趣的是 两个阶段
and it's interesting that both phases
对改变
are important for
神经系统到自己想要的状态
shaping our nervous system in the ways
都很重要 所以如果我们想调动
that we want so if we want to engage
神经可塑性 我们想要
neuroplasticity and we want to get the most
发挥神经系统的最大可能性
out of our nervous system we each have
我们需要掌握
to master
清醒和睡眠之间的过渡
that both the transition between
以及
wakefulness and sleep
睡眠和清醒之间的过渡
and the transition between sleep and
现在已经强调了很多
wakefulness now so much has been made of
睡眠的重要性
the importance of sleep and it is
对于伤口愈合至关重要
critically important for wound healing
对于我刚才提到的学习
for learning as i just mentioned for
巩固学习
consolidating learning
对于我们免疫系统的各个方面 都很重要
for all aspects of our immune system
这是一段
it is the one period of time in which
我们没有做DPO的时间
we're not doing these duration path and outcomes
这很关键
types of analyses and it is critically
对我们健康的各个方面都很重要
important to all aspects of our health
包括我们的寿命
including our longevity
然而 关于如何
much less has been made however of how
得到
to get
更好的睡眠  如何让入睡
better at sleeping how to get better at
以及熟睡的过程
the process that involves
变得更好
falling asleep staying asleep and
进入
accessing
这些身心状态
these states of mind and body that
涉及
involve
大多数人不知道的完全瘫痪
total paralysis most people don't know
在你大部分的睡眠中
this but you're actually paralyzed
你实际上瘫痪了
during much of your sleep so that you
你没办法把你的梦境付诸现实
can't act out your dreams presumably
但你的大脑总在那里
but also where your brain is in a total
处于不受控制的空闲状态
idle state where it's not controlling
脑中的剩下一切都是自由状态
anything it's just left to kind of free run 
有些事情我们可以做到
and there are certain things that we can
都是为了掌握
all do in order to master that
这种过渡
transition
为了更好地睡眠
in order to get better at sleeping and
它涉及的不只是
it involves much more than just how much
我们睡了多久  我们都知道
we sleep we're all being told of course
需要多睡觉
that we need to sleep more
还涉及到睡眠的质量
but there's also the issue of sleep
进入到那些深层的睡眠
quality accessing those deep states of
非DPO思维
non-dpo thinking
进入正确的睡眠时间
accessing the right timing of sleep not
到目前为止 已经有很多公开讨论
a lot has been discussed publicly as far
我知道什么时候该睡觉
as i'm aware of when to time your sleep
我认为我们所有人都知道
i think we all can appreciate that
在一天中
sleeping for half an hour
抽几个半小时睡觉 这样就有
throughout the day um so that you get a
总共八个小时的睡眠
total of eight hours of sleep
每24小时一周期  不过这很
every 24 hour cycle is probably very
不同
different
与实打实睡八个小时相比
and not optimal compared to a solid
并不是最佳的
block of eight hours of sleep
虽然有些人
although there are people that have
尝试这样做  这也被写进
tried this i think um it's been written
各种书里
about in various books
但没有多少人可以坚持
not many people can stick to that
那个时间表
schedule incidentally i think it's
那个是超级时间表
called the ubermen schedule not to be
不要和Huberman时间表相混淆
confused with the huberman's schedule
因为首先我的时间表并不是那样
because first of all my schedule doesn't
第二
look anything like that and second of
我永远不会尝试这样的
all i would never attempt such a
睡眠状态
sleeping regime
另一件很重要的事情是
the other thing that is really important to understand
我们还没有将其作为一种文化探索过
is that we have not explored it as a culture
我们醒来时的节奏状态
the rhythms that occur in our waking state
太多的精力集中在
so much has been focused on the value of
睡眠的质量和睡眠的重要性
sleep and the importance of sleep which
这当然很棒
is great
但我不认为大多数人
but i don't think that most people are
会注意到
paying attention to what's happening in
他们的清醒状态发生的事情
their waking states and when
以及他们的大脑何时针对焦点进行了优化
their brain is optimized for focus when
他们的大脑针对这些DPO进行了优化
their brain is optimized for these dpos
这些持续时间路径结果 的分析
these duration path outcome types of
分析学习和改变
engagements for learning and for changing and when
他们的大脑可能更适合
their brain is probably better suited
进行反射性的思考
for more reflexive thinking and
和行为
behaviors
事实证明 有一个巨大的
and it turns out that there's a vast
科学数据量
amount of scientific data
指出被称为“超昼夜节律”
which points to the existence of what
的存在
are called ultradian rhythms
 你可能听说过昼夜节律
you may have heard of circadian rhythms
昼夜节律意思是
circadian means
大约一天 是24小时的节奏
circa about a day so it's 24-hour rhythms because the
因为地球每24小时旋转一周
earth spins once every 24 hours
超昼夜节律贯穿着一整天
ultradian rhythms occur throughout the day
并且需要的时间更少
in and they require less time they're
短一点
shorter
我们在这次讨论中
the most important ultradian rhythms for
最重要的超昼夜节律是90分钟
sake of this discussion is the 90 minute
我们正在经历的节奏
rhythm that we're going through
一直以来 我们都有能力
all the time in our our ability to
参与并专注  在睡眠中
attend and focus and in sleep we are
我们的睡眠被分解成90分钟一段
our sleep is broken up into 90 minute segments
在深夜 我们有更多的阶段
early in the night we have more phase
一阶段和二阶段是较轻的睡眠 然后
one and phase two lighter sleep and then
我们进入更深的第三阶段
we go into our deeper phase three and
第四阶段睡眠 然后
phase four sleep and then
我们回到第一 二 三 四阶段
we return to phase one two three four so
整夜你都在经历
all night you're going through
这些超昼夜节律
these ultradian rhythms of stage one two
一二三四
three four
一二三四重复  
one two three four it's repeating most
很多人也许知道 也许不知道
people perhaps know that maybe they don't but
当你早上醒来时
when you wake up in the morning
这些节律继续 着
these altradian rhythms continue and it
原来我们
turns out that we are
针对焦点和注意力进行了优化
optimized for focus and attention
在这90分钟的周期内
within these 90-minute cycles so that at
这90分钟之一的开始
the beginning of one of these 90-minute
周期也许你坐下来学习
cycles maybe you sit down to learn
一些新的东西 或者第一次去做一些
something new or to engage in some
具有挑战性的事情
new challenging behavior for the first
其中一开始的五到十分钟
five or 10 minutes of one of those
众所周知 大脑和
it's well known that the brain and the
神经回路和神经调节剂
neural circuits and the neuromodulators
不会被调整到最佳状态
are not going to be optimally tuned to
无论你要做什么 但是
whatever it is you're trying to do but
当你深入那90分钟周期时
as you drop deeper into that 90 minute cycle
 你专注和参与
your ability to focus and to engage in
此dpo流程的能力
this dpo process and to direct
并主导神经可塑性与学习
neuroplasticity and to learn
实际上更好 然后你
is actually much greater and then you
最终会跳出这个
eventually pop out of that at the end of
90分钟的周期
the 90-minute cycle
所以这些周期发生在睡眠中
so these cycles are occurring in sleep
这些周期发生
and these cycles are occurring
在清醒中 所有这些都是
in wakefulness and all of those are
由警惕和冷静  两者如同跷跷板一般
governed by this seesaw of alertness to
支配着
calmness
我们称之为自主神经系统
that we call the autonomic nervous
所以如果你想
system so if you want to
掌握并控制 你的神经系统
master and control your nervous system
无论你使用什么工具
regardless of what tool you reach to
不管是药理学工具
whether or not it's a pharmacologic tool
或者一种行为工具
or whether or not it's a behavioral tool
又或者是一个脑电接口工具
or whether or not  it's a brain machine interface tool it's
至关重要的是要了解
vitally important to understand
你的整个存在  正在发生
that your entire existence is occurring
在这90分钟的周期内
in these 90-minute cycles whether or not
无论你是睡着了还是没有
you're asleep or awake
所以你真的需要学习
and so you really need to learn
如何
how to
进入这90分钟的周期 
wedge into those 90-minute cycles and
可以说 完全不明智
for instance it would be completely
和适得其反的尝试就是
crazy and counterproductive to try and
只是在深度睡眠的时候
just learn information while in deep
去直接听这些信息
sleep by listening to that information
因为 你无法访问它
because you're not able to access it it
但是
would be
非常好的是 
perfectly good however to engage in a
每天有一段集中的学习
focused bout of learning each day and
现在我们就知道学习时的专注的时间
now we know how long that focused bout
应该是多久
of learning should be
应该至少是90分钟的周期
it should be at least one 90-minute
你应该预料到
cycle and the expectation
那个的早期阶段
should be that the early phase of that
将充满挑战
cycle is going to be challenging
会感到难受
it's going to hurt it's not going to
不会感觉自然 不会像
feel natural it's not going to feel like
流水一般 但你可以学习着这么做
flow but that you can learn and the
你大脑中的回路  包括着
circuits of your brain that are involved
专注和动力  可以学会去
in focus and motivation can learn to
潜心进入集中更多注意力的模式
drop into a mode of more focus get more
得到更多  换句话说 神经可塑性
neuroplasticity in other words
通过参与这些超昼夜循环
by engaging these ultradian cycles at
在一天中的适当时间
the appropriate times of day
例如有些人在早上
for instance some people are very good
学习效率很高  但到了下午
learners early in the day and not so
却并非如此
good in the afternoon
所以你可以开始探索这个过程
so you can start to explore this process
即使没有
even without
任何有关神经化学物质
any information about the underlying
的基础信息 只需要集中更多的注意力
neurochemicals by simply paying attention
不只是去感受睡觉的时候
not just to when you go to sleep and
和每天早晨醒来时
when you wake up each morning
主观地感受到  你的睡眠有多深或多浅
how deep or how shallow your sleep felt to you subjectively
而且在一整天里
but also throughout the day when your
当你的大脑倾向于
brain tends to be
最焦虑的时候去集中注意力  因为事实证明
most anxious because it turns out that
这与知觉有关
has a correlate related to perception
我们将谈论这个  你可以问
that we will talk about you can ask
你自己  什么时候最专注
yourself when are you most focused when
你最不焦虑的是什么时候
are you least anxious 
什么时候最有动力
when do you feel most motivated
什么时候你感觉最
when you feel most
动力最小的
at least motivated by understanding
去理解你不同方面的
how the different aspects of your
感觉  感知  感受
perception sensation feeling
思想 行动 
thought and actions tend to want to be
是否想要调动自己
engaged or not want to be engaged you
开了一个很好的窗口  帮助你了解
develop a very good window into what's
如果你要
going to be required
转移能力来集中精力 需要什么
to shift your ability to focus or shift
转移能力来
your ability
从事创造性的思维
to engage in creative type thinking at
 你应该在一天中的不同时间里  选择这些时段
different times of day should you choose
这就是我们要讨论的
and so that's where we're heading going
一切都从掌握
forward it all starts with mastering
自主神经系统的跷跷板
this seesaw that is the autonomic nervous system that at
课程水平是
a course level is a transition between
从觉醒过渡到
wakefulness
睡眠 但最后
and sleep but at a finer level and just
同样重要的是
as important
这些交替周期
are the various cycles these all trading
这些90分钟的周期控制着我们的生活
90-minute cycles that govern our life
控制着我们每天
all the time 24 hours a day every day of
24小时的生活
our life
所以我们要谈谈你如何
and so we're going to talk about how you
去控制自主神经系统
can take control of the autonomic nervous system
这样 你可以更好地利用
so that you can better access
神经可塑性  更好地进入睡眠
neuroplasticity better access sleep
甚至可以利用
even take advantage of the phase that is
睡觉和醒来
the transition between
之间的过渡 来接近比如说
sleep and waking to access things like
创造力的方法
creativity
这些等等 都是基于最近一百年来
and so forth all based on studies that
已经出版的研究
have been published
主要是
over the last hundred years mainly
在过去的十年中新出的研究
within the last 10 years and some that
有些是非常新的研究
are very very new
并指出使用特定
and that point to the use of specific
可以让你
tools that will allow you to
充分利用神经系统的工具
get the most out of your nervous system
所以今天我们涵盖了很多信息
so today we covered a lot of information
像一场旋风之旅
it was sort of a whirlwind tour of
从神经元到突触的一切
everything from neurons and synapses
自主神经系统中的神经可塑性
to neuroplasticity in the autonomic
我们将重温很多
nervous system we will revisit a lot of
这些主题 
these themes going forward
因此 如果所有这些都没有融合在一起
so if all of that didn't sink in in one pass
请不要担心 我们会一遍又一遍地
please don't worry we will come back to
回到这些主题
these themes over and over again
我想传授你一套通用的词汇
i wanted to equip you with uh language
我们
that we're
在建立一种通用的基础词汇
all developing a kind of common base set
为了之后的信息传递
of information going forward
我希望这些信息对你有价值
and i hope the information is valuable
你要想想
to you and you're thinking about
什么对你有效
what is working well for you and is
什么对你没那么有效  
what's working less well and what's been
以及极具挑战性的是什么
exceedingly challenging what's been easy
以及对你来说容易的是什么
for you
根据你对特定事物的追求
in terms of your pursuit of particular
行为或情绪状态
behaviors or emotional states
 你的挑战或
where your challenges or the challenges
 你身边的人的挑战
of people that you know might reside
正如我们的欢迎视频中所承诺的
as promised in our welcome video the
Huberman实验室播客的格式为
format of the huberman lab podcast is to
在这一整个月中
dive deep into individual topics for an
深入探讨各个主题
entire month
在整个一月份
at a time so for the entire month of
我们将探索
january we're going to explore
这种不可思议的状态  不论是睡眠
this incredible state that is sleep and
还是相应的非睡眠状态 
a related state which is non-sleep deep
和深度休息
rest
以及它们对
and what they do for things like
学习  重塑我们的情感能力
learning resetting our emotional
的作用
capacity
每个人都可能熟悉
everyone's probably familiar with the
事实上 当我们睡眠不足
fact that when we're sleep deprived
我们
we're so much
不太善于处理生活中的情况
less good at dealing with life
更多时候
circumstances we're more
我们情绪不稳定 为什么会这样
emotionally labile why is that how is
但最重要的是 我们要
that but most importantly we're going to
谈论如何改善睡眠
talk about how to get better at sleeping
以及如何获得更好的睡眠
how to access better sleep even when
即便你睡眠的时间或持续时间受到影响
your sleep timing or duration is compromised
我们还将讨论支持这个
we're also going to talk about the data
非常有趣的状态
that support this
的数据 称为非睡眠
very interesting state called non-sleep
深度休息
deep rest
既不睡觉也不醒的地方
where one is neither asleep nor awake
但事实证明 人可以恢复
but it turns out one can recover
通过一些神经调节剂等等
some of the neuromodulators and more
重要的是
importantly the processes
感觉 感知 感受 思维 行动的过程
involved in sensation perception feeling
肯定是一个非常丰富的讨论
it's sure to be a very rich discussion
来回间 我会回答你
back and forth where i'm answering your
问题并提供工具
questions and providing tools
我敢肯定 你也会
and i'm certain you're also going to
学到很多信息
learn a lot of information
关于神经科学及其组成
about neuroscience and what makes up
你生命中这个不可思议的阶段
this incredible phase of your life where
你以为你没有意识 但是
you think you're not conscious but
你实际上是
you're actually
重置和更新自己
resetting and renewing yourself in order
让自己表现更好
to perform better
在清醒状态下感觉更好等
feel better etc in the waking state if
